    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2078.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2078.768s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2080.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2082.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First, I thank Councilor Tseng to bring this forward, the changes forward, but I appreciate that he has the avenue to reach probably the smartest legal minds in the country at Harvard, but it'd be interesting to see the changes that are made to the call-in center or our legal team to look at what changes are made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2105.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2106.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You did say a lot, so I'm lost in translation right now because I haven't seen anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2111.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that it's a little premature to bring all these changes that were presented by legal support at Harvard when we had the Collins Center, who are attorneys, that we vetted all of these processes through with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2128.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I- I love the point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2131.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I did also work with the Collins Center on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2133.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: OK, good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2134.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: some, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2135.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that, you know, it'd be interesting once we get those, I think that, um, vetted properly again through the call and center to make sure that, uh, the ones that weren't, if they were, um, you know, like I said, I don't, I trust them, but again, that Harvard's not our legal representative to, um, to lead us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2154.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that it's important that we make sure we do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2157.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, now with the process, the two big changes, I think that, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2162.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, the lesser of, uh, is the mayor, the mayor's position as the president of the other chair of the city of the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2171.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, I feel strongly that I think she or the mayor's position should be the leader of that, uh, that body and, um, and for many different reasons, but I leave it, I leave that at the will of the voters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2185.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, but I think what's more important, I think that this council has been in, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2192.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: has been questioned over and over again, that are we making the right decisions for the whole community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2198.107s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or are we doing this for one base?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2202.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when we hear time after time, because I'm sure you got the emails, I'm sure you got the phone calls, I'm sure you got the communication with the community that are very, very perplexed that this council would run on a platform<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2221.907s">[Scarpelli]</a>: of eight ward representations and then three at large candidates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2226.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's bothersome that the question of equity comes around and gets thrown around easily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2235.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this format clearly is not equitable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2242.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To think that this council is going to make a decision, possibly vote for this format,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2247.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and possibly leave wards and leave parts of our community unrepresented would be a travesty because it's not about this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2256.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As been said before, this is about the council today, the council in five years, the council in 10 years, and the council in 20 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2264.168s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And being uniformed and giving people the opportunity to run for office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2268.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we talked about all the pluses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2271.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I remember because I fought against those pluses, remember?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2274.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was against charter review for a long, long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2277.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it took a lot of talking to different communities, talking to colleagues in different communities and understanding from members of the charter review team and surveys and really understanding the importance of equity and what that meant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2297.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this format that you're proposing and you're changing is an absolute shame to the community<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2305.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that has worked for two years, over 200 meetings, and all identified an eight and three format.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2313.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talk about why are people coming out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2316.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why are people not connected to this process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2321.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we identified the fact that we don't have board representation, and the fact that maybe there might be someone in that community that hasn't come out to vote,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2333.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that re-energizes that community to be part of this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2338.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What an opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2340.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then we talk about running in as an at-large member and how expensive that would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2346.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And how many people, if you look around this reel, we all look the same, most of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2353.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And most of us work together to get funding one way or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2358.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But to run for an office, you know what it takes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2360.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 20, 25,000 possibly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2365.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And looking at ward representation opens up the avenues for so many of the underprivileged that would never, ever, ever have the opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2375.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's befuddling to me that I have openly read the platform of the Our Revolution Method that talked openly about ward representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2385.11s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, I know we could say that no district representation is ward representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2389.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Misleading and not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2391.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because as members of that organization that have reached out to me to speak on their behalf, they were clearly under the assumption it was eight representatives, every ward representative, big or small, elected population or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2410.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To sit here and think that this process, this change is good, it's good for six people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2418.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's good for their future in the business of politics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2424.041s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You could say it isn't, but if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, I've said it, it's a duck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2431.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is self-serving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2433.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not what the community is asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2436.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again and again, someone that might run for re-election and maybe not, you're giving a lot of people a lot of ammunition for one key factor for my colleagues here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2447.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're just not listening to all of our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2452.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2454.52s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You had a body that was presented to you that you supported 1,000%, that had over 200 meetings and worked for two years, then sat with professionals with 80 years of experience that presented what this community is crying for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2474.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to sit up here tonight and say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2477.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is so exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2481.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This seven-member board, six are probably gonna vote for something the rest of the community is drastically against.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2489.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you can't say they're not because I'm getting the emails, I'm getting the phone calls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2494.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so are our members that are on the Charter Review Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2500.928s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I beg my fellow councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2503.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we don't see eye to eye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2506.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and a lot of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2509.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I know for sure the base that voted you in, that have reaching out to me, they want the eight ward representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2520.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They want the 11 members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2523.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm actually begging for you to please consider voting this down and going back to the original format.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2532.01s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if not,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2533.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As I've said to many people, I implore that you reach out to the mayor because that is the next step to veto this because what's going to happen is that there's enough negativity out there that when this does go to the people and it does go to the vote, all their hard work is going to go for naught because the intentions of this council seems to be self-serving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2558.368s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that might hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2559.289s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You might think it's inflammatory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2560.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You might think this is politics and you can cry whatever you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2564.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but it's exactly what it says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2566.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What you're doing, it's exactly what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2571.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They put a lot of work, this committee put a lot of work into this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2577.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it was clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2578.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And for someone that was so negative about it, and I turned full force around, and I'm sitting here advocating for it to other members of our community, so they can understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2591.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's so clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2594.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It is so clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2596.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Eight leaves nobody behind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2598.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Think about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2600.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Eight leaves nobody behind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2604.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The other option possibly will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2609.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you talk about combining wards, that's still a big area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2614.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That still doesn't entice the equity that we've so many times cried for here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2620.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We wanna see a more diverse council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2623.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what you all said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2624.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We only have one person of color.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2625.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've heard that over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2629.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you look at neighboring communities, you see a group of elected officials that represent their communities because they're giving the opportunity to run for that office without limitations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2649.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2651.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To be a politician, please vote 6 to 1 and give the people that are running for office against you, give them more ammunition that you're just simply not listening to the residents of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2664.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're seeing it over and over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2668.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whether you win a vote or whether you don't, it's still very close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2677.636s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'll end with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2680.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This will get voted and moved through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2683.928s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If this goes the way it usually does, it'll be six to one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2688.553s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It'll go to the council meeting, then it'll be voted against six to one, and then it'll go to the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2693.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then again, people will have to gather, people have to rally, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2698.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then they'll say, Councilor Scarpelli is being negative again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2701.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's starting a group to go against what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2705.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To go against<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2706.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what we're doing here and not listening to the residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2709.868s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because in every platform that I've been involved in, in this community and helping residents, there's one common denominator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2719.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2721.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This administration is not listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2724.717s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whether it's zoning issues, whether it's override issues, whether it's charter review issues, it's the same cry<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2737.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're not listening to all 60,000 residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2742.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're making your decisions on your special interest, and that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2749.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, I know what it takes to be a bigger person and say, you know what, look yourself in the mirror and say, not what best for me, George Scapelli, because that's what I was doing when I was sitting back and saying, no, Mr. McDonald, I don't believe in this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2763.719s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't believe in ward representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2766.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you look yourself in the mirror and say, well, you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2769.51s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Look at the variables and how positively it affects the pros and cons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2776.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And how could you not want eight representatives?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2779.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How could you not want all wards represented?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2782.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if I offended anybody, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2787.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, this is coming from people that have openly said they voted for members of this council and feel like they're not even being heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3238.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3244.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One thing I concur with my colleague is that this process doesn't stop with this process for equity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3255.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but I can guarantee you an eight ward council moves us forward a lot quicker in equity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3262.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as we move forward, the equity builds off of that eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3268.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: By not going with the eight, you're limiting that equity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3271.929s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now it's great when you could take numbers, and my colleague is a brilliant individual, we know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3280.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I revert back to a very important comment I've made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3286.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The residents feel strongly with the 8-3 format, period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3295.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What works, what doesn't work, what communities it works in, we can mold whatever we want to fit your narrative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3304.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But understand very simply, we've heard from the call-in center, the professionals, for all due respect to my colleague, 80 years of experience between the two of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3316.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've heard that I believe there's only a handful of councils throughout the commonwealth that aren't based the way of an A3 council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3329.913s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And doing my research and reaching out to those councils that do have that ward representation, it works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3339.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The voices are heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3341.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The neighborhoods come out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3344.304s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People are rejuvenated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3347.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's more energy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3350.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to say that this process might hurt my colleague, that's not true at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3356.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're an incumbent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3360.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's now controlling a base, where now this opens the process of eight wards, depending where we all live.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3372.107s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because it could be that a few of you might be running against each other in a few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3377.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we can't have that because it's true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3382.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's a very simple format.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3386.099s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's easy to speak and spin dialogue and understand, but I want you to go back to the most important piece that I brought up and that I implore all of you to listen to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3396.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The community has worked very, very hard with the leadership of our Charter Review Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3404.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They have done years of data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3407.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've done years of door knocking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3410.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've done years of meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3413.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've done the work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3415.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not a few weeks in between talking to friends at Harvard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3420.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've done the work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3421.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They pulled up the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3424.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They came to us for what their view was with the residents, all of the residents that they queried.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3433.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They met with an organization that had nothing to gain, just experience, and they shared their opinions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3444.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can talk as much as we want and spin it as much as we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3447.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The bottom line is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3451.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you go against the 8-3 representation, if we go against it, you are truly going against what the majority of this community is asking for through the Charter Review Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3463.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you are definitely not accelerating the process of equity, period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3470.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You could say whatever you wanna say, whatever daddy you wanna say, but I will guarantee you, if we have a member in our community that feels like they need to run and they might be marginalized, it's not gonna work when you have to do it with two wards, that's even difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3488.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And at large, we know how hard that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3493.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, the vote will be the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3496.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just hope that my colleagues reconsider and actually go back to November past and remember what you promised your people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3508.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because again, I'm only bringing this up because they're calling me and they're sharing it with me to share this council publicly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3521.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3523.51s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll leave you with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3524.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's important that we could spin anything we want, and we can say whatever we want to make it fit whatever narrative we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3531.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if it's right in front of you, and I won't say duck anymore, if it's right in front of you, and if it's black and white, it's black and white.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3541.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's been said and heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3542.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sure you've gotten a bunch of emails yourselves, phone calls yourselves, people from the podium, people that were on Zoom in the last couple of meetings, they've shared this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3554.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because I haven't heard one person come back and say, hey, Councilor Scarpelli, what a great format, five and four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4173.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4176.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we've heard this over and over again with this council is we were voted for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4181.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We were voted to make these decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4184.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We were, what we did was support a body that would go out to the public to do all the work for us, to do everything that we're looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4197.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're just saying that's not happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4200.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They did that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4202.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The charter review committee,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4205.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: was given the ability to go out all over the community and get what this community as a whole thought was best for this community, our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4216.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To say that we can't go out and survey the whole community, let's do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4224.261s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But even to that point, we have a charter review committee that this council voted for, that we pushed through, that we, excuse me, excuse me, I take that back, you're right, we didn't vote for it, but we support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4237.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, so we support it, that we support and we applaud it every time you came up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4243.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm sorry, because I'm getting testimony from people on the committee that feel a little slighted from my colleagues' comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4250.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that felt some of the charter members feel that while they're insulted right now for the way that things were presented just now, just to share with you that the idea that that work wasn't done, the work was done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4265.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We applauded these members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4267.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We applauded the two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4268.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We applauded the over 200 meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4270.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They went out, went to corner to corner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4272.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They got the information that you are saying that we don't have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4275.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4277.796s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4278.609s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what they came back with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4279.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They came back with the report that favorably said, unanimously from the people that I've talked to, that it was eight and three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4290.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then you say, you know, well, we were elected to make these decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4299.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're minimizing the fact that this elected body understood that there was a charter review committee that went out and did the work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4308.065s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we sat through maybe four or five meetings, and all of a sudden came back with an idea or a process that you think, six of you think, that that might be the best way to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4320.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Five and four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4323.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's disingenuous to say that the work wasn't done, that people didn't do their homework, that they didn't listen to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4329.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're not listening to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4331.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They said it over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4333.945s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that the Charter Review Committee did their homework, they talked to people, they came back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4340.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll guarantee you this, maybe we didn't hit 100 out of 100 people, but if you asked 100 people, hey, would you like a city council representative in your neighborhood or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4360.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Would you want to share with another ward and minimize how important your ward is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4368.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because that's what the questioning is, because that's what I'm hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4370.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what people have said to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4372.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So wait, so saying that possibly my ward won't be represented, that's saying what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4378.316s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That the council doesn't feel that my neighborhood is that important?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4385.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are the questions that were asked to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4392.417s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we're hearing tonight is truly a lot of talk, but you haven't answered the questions that's being asked by, when I say 20 out of 20 people that reached out to me, are you doing what the residents are asking for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4411.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you don't need a survey to say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4415.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The people did their homework.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4418.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, if anybody in the Charter Review Committee feels slighted,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4422.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope it's not for me, it's not intended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4425.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We appreciate the work that you've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4427.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why I unanimously supported your 8-3 format.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4433.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We went through the process, the exercise with the call-in center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4437.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They supported the 8-3, it was very clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4441.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, excuse me, they didn't support that, but understanding they've shown me enough information that the 8-3 format is what I would support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4452.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I just don't think that you're making a decision for what's best for this community and the future of this community when it comes to the elected body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4463.922s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when you talk about equity, you're looking to see what fits this dialogue for this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4472.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And no matter what you say after this comment that I just made, I'm just telling you, that's the perception that's out to the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4480.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: not not the George Scarpelli public, but the public that have reached out to me that normally wouldn't talk to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4489.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So and, you know, I'm just imploring you that I'm sharing this with people that support the six of you have called me and said, Thank you, Council Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4500.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm really taken back with the people that I supported because I was under the impression that it was 83.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4507.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=10869.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I bring this to light because it has been an issue for this council for almost four years now, maybe more now, is that I appreciate that Councilor Tseng did his due diligence in reaching out to legal minds that he is directly involved with, but as one councilor, not having a city solicitor and not having that opportunity<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=10890.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or running these changes through a city solicitor is something this council should be really upset about and hopefully do something about it because this is a huge concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=10905.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that what we're hearing is just common sense where I think we're saying things to be too smart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=10920.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: where instead it's right in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=10924.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what's in front of you is there is no doubt that an eight ward representation, that there is no concern, there is no question that anybody has brought up or anybody has talked about, even tonight, that how the eight representatives will negatively affect us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=10945.168s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we've also heard how the eight is really the will of the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=10952.681s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I know we don't want to talk about politicizing anything, but this is what it comes down to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=10961.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At least that's what it seems like to my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=10966.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=10967.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You could deny it all you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=10969.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You can question it or run numbers or state legal genre, whatever it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=10977.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the bottom line is very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=10982.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Remember where we were two years ago in a day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=10987.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had residents over and over again, door knocking, trying to get signatures, and it just wasn't happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=10998.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we turned to a child review committee and give them the energy to go out and do the will of the people, bring us back the information of the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11009.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what they did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11013.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And even in all these committees, all these governance committees, we didn't hear out of that 5-4, and I haven't even looked into it for the fact that I think it's wrong in every sense of the way, how that satisfies everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11028.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the truth of the matter is even the people that supported the 5-4 didn't have an issue with 8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11039.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then again, we talk about the lack of turnout.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11043.526s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know one resident said the lack of turnout and the same people come here, the same people do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11048.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, this is one of the intents of an eight person ward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11055.756s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's to generate, to rejuvenate that base, to get people out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11061.16s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whether there's 10 people that vote in the ward or 10,000 people that vote in the ward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11067.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know it hurts people's feelings when people call them on things, but that's too bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11076.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is our job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11077.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My job is to make sure that people wanna spin it as much as they want and saying this is, he's polarizing, he's making this into something it isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11087.716s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All I've done from the beginning of this process is share the information and questions that residents have sent to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11098.099s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I've shared my personal opinion where I was and where I am today with the charter review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11106.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you could sit back and when I get off and defend it and say, he's bad, he's trying to rattle the tree again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11112.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The bottom line is this, you haven't shown your constituency that for some reason this eight ward representation brings a negative light to the city of Medford in any way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11128.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4795.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4796.571s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can you hear me, Madam Chair?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4799.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4800.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, I think what Judith is bringing up and what some residents have reached out to me and, um, and the understanding of, um, this type of change zoning change in the one family neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4816.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the realistic<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4817.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The answer has to be that this is a realistic outcome, that it's not going to be 10, 20, 30 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4829.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: After last week's meeting, I had developers calling me that shared that, George, just so you know, as a developer, that we won't wait 10, 20 years, and they'll do it as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4844.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: knocking on those doors for those one family homes and offering some pretty substantial monies to purchase those homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4853.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that to share the information, the questions that residents have been reaching out to me that the reason why they brought it to my attention because we talked about this at the meeting a few weeks ago is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4871.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the fear of losing their close-knit neighborhood and then turning it into a very dense, transient community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4884.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's something that, you know, it's not what I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4886.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, you know, you can have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4891.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: neighborhoods of three-family homes and still have a community failing that a one-family neighborhood has, but it's a realistic fear that the residents in these neighborhoods have shared the concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4906.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I don't want to minimize or I don't want to be on the council in two or three, four years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4913.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we see drastic changes in one family neighborhoods in that district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4919.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And all of a sudden saying, wait a second, this wasn't supposed to happen this quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4923.571s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that it sure, I mean, it could move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4929.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with the 30-year process as people age out, but this could also happen within a year of these zoning changes that developers are knocking on doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4940.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think people have to understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4943.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is one reason why I wouldn't support this venture because I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4951.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still haven't informed our neighbors enough of these changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4956.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we've tried and we're, we're making strides and getting more information out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4961.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, these are the same issues that, you know, we have a resident like miss Briggs that just came to the podium, very educated, very involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4969.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She came to the city council meeting, but we have multiple other members of our community that are very confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4977.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: who don't want to come to a meeting that don't understand this process, and we're not going into their neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4985.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I just needed to share that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4987.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been saying it since we started the meetings, when we started our rezoning meetings, and that we do have to do a better job so residents can understand this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4996.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know Councilor Bears did a great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5000.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, answering the question about the one family and people not being able to build their one families if it comes down or it has to redo an existing one family, that was something that was very confusing to a lot of people, including myself, and I appreciate that description, but I do think that we have to be realistic and we have to be, make sure that both sides of their concerns are heard because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5029.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh yes it is we do need rezoning yes and we need some we need more housing but at the same time it is true that within a relatively possibly when within a relatively short period of this rezoning that these neighborhoods can be and will be drastically different the one family<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5054.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, neighborhood feeling will be gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5057.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that that's a realistic outlook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5060.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not trying to be divisive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5062.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's people want to know that, is that a possibility?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5066.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just want to be fair that yes, we could see the possibility of attrition and the process go through so we can see the changes that might be needed, but also could also be something very drastic and very fast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5082.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and uh could be very it could be changed very very quickly so i appreciate the time madam chair but i think that i had to share what conversations i have had with members of that community and i think that as we move forward um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5097.417s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5097.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Briggs brought up another very important question that, is it just this neighborhood?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5101.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that with our consultants and our community development board, we really have to put a list together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5108.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So those neighbors that aren't being talked about, people that aren't at the table right now, that they know that this type of situation is coming to their neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5118.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'd appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5120.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=494.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You want to turn your... You can hear me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=509.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=510.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Zach, now I know exactly how you feel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=513.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So powerful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=518.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I won't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=519.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, good evening, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=521.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for joining us this evening for our subcommittee on education and cultural committee today, February 25th, 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=528.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Will our clerk call the roll, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=547.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=548.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, four present, one showing up soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=556.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's move forward if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=558.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is, we're here to discuss Resolution 25-027, Resolution to Discuss Recreation Department Programs for Youth with Disabilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=568.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Be it resolved that the committee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=570.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: on education and culture schedule a meeting on February 25 at six o'clock city council chambers, the committee will discuss the needs of the recreation department for the upcoming budget season, and the committee will also discuss the recreational programs involving our disabled community if I can, if you can all allow me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=588.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would like if my fellow Councilors, because the parents are the reason why we're here, I think that it would behoove us to have them speak and just share with us because part of this discussion is starting a new slate here at Medford with recreation, our leadership team, and looking into making sure that we have a partnership<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=611.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with our parents, the recreation department, and the city leadership to make sure that we can follow through for our wishes for our families, disabled families here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=625.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So would anybody like to kick it off?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=628.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Come on up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=631.796s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=632.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Name and... Nice to see you, my friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=639.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We sure do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=898.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=974.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1063.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1064.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I, I, I think that I appreciate, um, I appreciate the discussions we've had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1070.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Patricia, I appreciate what my fellow colleagues, I know that Councilor Callahan and Councilor Leming really took the leadership role with this and moving it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1080.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and then coming out that evening to bring this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1084.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, as I will speak as a City Councilor for the City of Medford, who is the chairperson that brought a full-time recreation department to the City of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1095.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we started that program under Mayor Burke at the time, we really wanted to focus that when we started, it was really a very thin program when it talked about staffing, funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1112.368s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was really supposed to be a self-sustaining program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1114.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as we move forward, we were supposed to have been growing with our community and enhancing programs like we're talking about tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1125.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're in a position I think that where we met the city council and all of our council members felt that we felt strong so strong about this that looking at that position is very important in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1139.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the, the recreation department is that department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1145.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like I said, we might not have been happy with how things have gone in the past, but I think that I can speak of what I've seen as a resident of Medford is that we've had some hurdles because of limitations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1159.651s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is why starting this meeting off right and saying, OK, having our programs, having a leader like Kevin, working with a parent organization that we can craft together, and then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1175.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: work for zero to 99.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1177.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because that's what the recreation department's for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1180.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The recreation department isn't about sports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1182.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know, unfortunately, it seems like it's been the Saturday three o'clock to four o'clock program, but I think tonight you'll hear some pretty exciting stories and plans that we have to move forward with, not just sports programs, but other programs that we're looking to enhance our programs for our families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1199.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But being a city program, a city department, we're that conduit<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1205.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to the library.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1206.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're the conduit to the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1208.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to bring all that together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1209.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So at least that's how I feel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1212.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll call on my colleagues, but if we can, I think you have something to add.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1219.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1284.51s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, right now this is still a position that we have to petition to the mayor and go through the process, and hopefully that's going to be part of the discussion as we move forward where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1297.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the mayor is the ultimate authority in the city deems to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1300.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's going to be important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1302.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think tonight is really just have that discussion to get all that information out that then we can report back to the mayor and the council and we can move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1332.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1356.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I'll say it again like we started, that's yesterday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1360.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The hope is as we're here tonight, the hope is that we,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1364.928s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm a program developer for a city that gives me the opportunity to do a lot of great things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1369.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we know we can't, I don't make the decisions, because I don't know what different demographics need in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1376.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is where we are today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1378.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is where the start, it's going to be the start, at least how I feel, is the start of something amazing where parents will work with the recreation department, the leadership team there, and whatever piece we do get,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1390.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and move that forward together because we can make, we're not, at least I, as a city councilor, I'm not going to do a program just to check a box.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1400.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not, that's not the way I do things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1403.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not checking boxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1404.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why we're doing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1405.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why we're having this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1407.016s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1408.096s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1409.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that Councilor Callahan, uh, and then Councilor<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1548.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1590.373s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All set?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1591.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1591.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1592.574s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council Beas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2172.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2174.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're bringing up great questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2175.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what we hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2175.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are the things we want to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2177.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And Adam takes great, great notes, and we're going to break it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2181.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thanks, Adam.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2269.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2270.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2461.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2462.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, if I can't, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2464.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We call on Councilor Leming, who's from Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2720.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2720.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know I know everyone needs to talk but I know that we have councils that I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2725.304s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We only have about 15 minutes left, but I know that we wanted the director also to share some information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2730.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if you have, if you have anything time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2741.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2743.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Tseng, you had your hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2842.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: OK, so I know we have one more person before Kevin, but you have three minutes to name and address the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2864.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2891.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2992.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2992.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Kevin, if you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2994.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And before Kevin starts I think that this is this is good what we're doing is good, because I, from what I see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=3001.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm saying this is two positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=3002.98s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm seeing what we originally thought we're coming in for is really putting together programs for our disabled community through the recreation department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=3011.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as Tanya started the program and looking at a totality of what we need, this is something that I, this is great to hear where we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=3019.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Cause they really think it's two different, two different positions because they think we need that person, but then we need that person with the boots on the ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=3107.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council President, I had that, as one of my closing comments is gonna be that maybe we need to start<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=3113.65s">[Scarpelli]</a>: two groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=3114.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One is a working group that we talk about the greater position and then the more parent group that's working recreation where we are today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=3121.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So Kev, I know that you've been waiting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=3123.233s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=3124.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=3843.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, and to to share with that, Kevin, I think that as a professional, when we started this process years ago to make method a full-time program, I think we dropped the ball like we've done with a lot of things in the last five and a half years but II<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=3860.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to give people an understanding what neighboring recreation departments have, I'll use ours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=3867.18s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=3869.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm the program developer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=3871.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a recreation manager.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=3875.763s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then we have eight program coordinators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=3879.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have a marketing specialist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=3881.165s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a financial director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=3883.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have administrative assistant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=3884.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a facilities director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=3887.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we also have a pool, an aquatics director and an assistant aquatics director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=3893.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're bringing in now, what we're looking now is to bring in a recreation therapeutic specialist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=3899.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and that's the person that started helping us start this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=3902.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I can see the limitations and I think this is two separate issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=3907.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think what we have right now, really as what we discussed earlier, two very different and specific wants and needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=3914.855s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One is really having that inclusion specialist that is overlooking the whole city where it's just not recreation, but everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=3922.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: right, getting our families and our 0-99 involved in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=3928.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then having that recreation person that's looking at recreation programming, partnering with the parents, not coming from what Kevin's going to say, or from what I'm going to say, or what Joe Levine will say in Malden, but really work with parents to say, these are the programs<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=3945.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that would could run out of recreation, that would be successful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=3948.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, what you have in front of you is one of the programs that talking to parents and getting an idea as just a rough draft that we can kick to get it started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=3957.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But yeah, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=3996.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that came from- It can be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=3998.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And miss Sherry, this came from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4000.209s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this came from the parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4001.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's why when Kevin said we're going to start fresh is really do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4014.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4015.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4017.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I, we are coming close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4018.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We do have, it looks like one person from the community who has a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4022.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then if I can just tie some things in and if any other councils want to just add that in, just really tie this day up and get some action step for the, as we move, move to tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4034.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4035.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Gaston, if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4137.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Gaston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4139.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council Bias.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4228.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4228.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I do think that that's, that's a great motion, but if we can, if someone can make a motion that, that through this, through this subcommittee meeting that we have, we call on Kevin Bailey is the recreation director to work with our parents to start a parent working group for recreation programming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4251.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we get that piece tied in so we can continue with that growth if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4256.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we could, that piece, we can get that running right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4261.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4263.52s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4272.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With a parent organization to continue with programs for families with disabilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4285.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I think that if we, from what I've heard, right, I think that if we look at Councilor Callahan had a great point and volunteers are great, but in my experience,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4296.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: volunteers aren't sustainable, but bringing that volunteer in as part of a working group with that volunteer, we have some great people in the audience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4305.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I won't call her name out because I know she's probably the smartest recreation mind dealing with this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4314.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think it's so important that we involve that person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4318.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Kevin's good friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4320.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we look at starting a working group with someone from the diversity team, the school department, the recreation department, our parent volunteers, our community volunteers, a city council member in community affairs and someone from the mayor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4336.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that as we start the budget process, I think that's the team we need to bring together to express what you said, Tanya, when we first started is something bigger than I thought when you first came up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4348.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Boy, that was a kick in the pants to say, okay, this is something bigger than just recreation programs and not making it to sports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4355.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that our community needs for growth and development, not just through their birth, but as we know, my little friend who's now 21 is now moving on and is gonna need that support as well to grow and get involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4374.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4376.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So Kevin, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4455.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It could be a volunteer recreation assistant director in a neighboring community that lives in Medford that might volunteer his time to help with that process as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4466.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think maybe we have a sidebar at the end of the meeting and we just talk and get put something concrete together because I know you up there Kevin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4474.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What people don't understand, when your director, when your team has to spend 10 to 15 hours a week returning emails, returning phone calls, doing menial, you know, positions that really weren't meant for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4489.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, I know that, you know, Kevin's dealing with getting the pond and pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4494.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like I said, I have two people that are doing one pool right now and, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4500.417s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Granted, it's beneficial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4504.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4504.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's facilitating, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4506.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's getting it, painting, whatever needs to be done, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4510.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All the safety protocols in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4511.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so we understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4513.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope everybody understands that there has been so many limitations because it hasn't been funded correctly and staffed correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4520.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think I've talked to parents to nauseam about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4522.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as we're moving forward, I think that we have a path for programming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4526.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because of the Tri-City partnership that you can use different resources to really bring some great programming for our families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4535.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So with that piece, I think that that's what we can talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4540.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that's something we'll talk about the site because I know we're running out of time but I know that as we move forward that bigger picture like council bear said I think that's something that as we get into the budget season we really start talking as a greater picture to craft that that job description of really what we want that person to do that's going to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4581.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't I don't want to call them out there, but you've done such great work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4586.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll get and then we have, you know, Council Kelly and Council lemon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4590.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's already been working with the parents with that bigger picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4593.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think I think that'd be great that maybe if they could take that leadership and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4599.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then work with that working group with that volunteer and getting everybody together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4604.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that bringing it all together, especially a budget time when we all bring this to the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4608.437s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're all going to have some pretty interesting requests and ask and I'm not going to say no to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4615.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're scamming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4617.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Alright, so does anybody else have any questions or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4625.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a motion on the tables.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4626.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Anybody second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4627.456s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council, please motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4629.016s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second, Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4631.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can you please call the roll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4634.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Doesn't need a roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4636.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4637.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4637.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4639.379s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4640.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4641.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any other questions before we wrap up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4643.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we do have a meeting that started 20 minutes ago, but- 12, 12.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4648.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 12 minutes ago, but I'll make sure that this happens in a separate evening where we have more time dedicated to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4653.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, thank you everybody for coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4655.73s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We appreciate this is a beginning and we'll talk at the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4660.553s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Motion to adjourn by Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4663.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4663.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second by Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4664.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Ayes have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4666.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Meeting adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=4667.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=778.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=781.949s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, great words from Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=785.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that Ruthie was what Medford was all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=792.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Her heart is open to everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=794.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She was so sweet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=795.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when it came to election time, if you ever drove by Ruthie's home, she had everyone sign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=801.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think she could ever say no to anyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=804.209s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And her allegiance was to anybody that ran for office here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=810.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=812.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, she told you like it was, there were times that she's pulled me aside and then brought me over to her Cod table at some fairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=819.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we negotiated some issues in the community, but she's definitely someone this community will miss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=827.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Her family is a very strong family in Medford that have faith and love of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=834.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we send out our deepest condolences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=838.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She will definitely be missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=839.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1130.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry for the long solution but I think that that's minimal what Bob scary deserves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1141.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Bob was very special.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1142.548s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that he was a true passionate lover of the city of Medford and its people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1154.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whenever anybody needed anything, Bob Skerry was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1158.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whether it was his time on the school committee or if somebody was having an issue as a senior citizen and they were having an issue at the state house, Bob would find a way to make it his mission to support<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1171.792s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh, anyone that crosses path.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1174.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, I was very fortunate that I served in the school committee with Bob scary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1178.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I still remember my first day and, um, being elected and Bob came to the house and, um, with the cigar in his hand and pulled me aside and said, all right, son, this is how it goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1192.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is what you'll do and make sure that you have respect for this position because it deserves that respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1199.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: everything from the clothes that I was supposed to wear to the way I address constituents and the way that we respected our office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1207.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Bob was truly a man that always gave back to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1214.584s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when we heard, when Bob came up and whispered in my ear and said, it's got me, buddy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1221.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he talked about the cancer and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1227.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He fought and I know that he had a tough last couple of weeks, but he's in a better place today and Bob's family will miss him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1237.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The city of Medford will miss him and I'll miss him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1239.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So may he rest in peace and condolences to his family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1243.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1767.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1768.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that this is something that first I've seen of it, so 10 to 20 Red Beach Parkway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1775.159s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What are the abutters?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1776.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have the abutters been notified?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1777.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are there abutters next, residents next to this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1782.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I think that before we move this forward, were the neighbors informed and how do they feel about the situation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1806.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for the clarification, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2037.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2039.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I do see everything is in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2041.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that there was one clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2043.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the clerk, just publicly, I know that the hours of operations, is that something we're changing now, Mr. Clerk?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2051.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or does the petition have to come back for those extended hours?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2059.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: OK, so they do have to come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2061.159s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So your hours are till 11 o'clock right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2063.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: OK, and then I know usually Kelly's was a great location for a little time after for people that work late, or Justin, who is at Harvard until 2 in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2076.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or when that Councilor Scarpella has a few items on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2081.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My wife won't allow me to go there anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2084.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was one of the last people with the punch card, the three-way punch card.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2089.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You guys don't know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2091.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2091.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see everything is in order, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2093.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that already the feedback I've heard from people that super professional and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2100.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that they're excited about this new venture with our new organization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2104.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And after my fellow colleagues have any comments, I would move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2925.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2927.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you to the both of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2928.532s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that this is a daunting task.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2930.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's one thing we talked about earlier, how we have so many department heads doing so much with so little.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2935.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2937.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that, is this the same, Mr. Hotel, we talked about the federal program and we talked about the lead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2944.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is this in the same vein with that funding or is it separate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2951.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, we didn't get it, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2969.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2970.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Fred Lasky's, I'm sure his line is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2974.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: hope that's that's copper so I know that again I think that the biggest thing again is when you talk about this I know we'll get phone calls from neighbors if they come and start doing this in the on the streets when it's time we'll have a plan in place with I know you've been super aggressive with the curb to curb or making sure that whatever we cut<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3011.186s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3011.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there'll be a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3012.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So people understand when it comes out to their end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3014.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3015.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I thank you for all your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3017.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that we need and it's something, especially as you're hearing throughout the, you know, throughout the country, when you hear about lead, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3024.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, let in the water and people getting nervous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3026.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that it's a step in the right direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3028.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we appreciate that and how it works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3030.796s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4116.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Possibly waive the three readings with this, because I think that the units that have been waiting a while, if we could move forward and waive the readings, I'd appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2456.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2457.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I appreciate the hard work of the chatter review committee and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2464.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I disagree with my colleagues as a former school committee member for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2472.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The importance to have the leader of your community, if<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2476.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this committee saw fit that she would still represent a voting member of the school committee is that it's very important and vital piece that that person is the chairperson leading that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2491.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It just doesn't make sense that the leader of your community is a side chair to a committee that really doesn't move forward without the power of the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2505.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I've read my colleagues on the school committee's requests and what their, what the concerns were for the members that I've talked to in the charter committee that this is something that people supported.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2522.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if we were going that way, this is what we needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2526.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll say this probably 10 more times until after the vote, whenever that may be, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2532.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the more that this council dips in and changes to fit a narrative, the less likely that this will move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2546.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that has to be a realistic concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2550.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've already talked to state delegates that have said that residents have already approached them with the disdain that they've heard already from just the ward representation question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2562.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's, this is hard work from people that, many people on this council put instead of this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2572.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And a long time with professionals sitting at the table, and it seems like as you read these answers, these questions and these changes, they seem one-sided and set to be, to fit a certain dialogue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2588.373s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know I've been, in the past, mentioned that everything I turn into is political.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2598.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You can say it, or you can read it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2602.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because this is exactly what councils in the past have asked for, and many people have tried to change the charter, and we move forward with a group of people that work very hard<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2613.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to bring out this initiative that was supported by the call-in center or vetted out by the call-in center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2621.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And already, this should have been something that I read through when I had colleagues in neighboring communities read through and see the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2629.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, like I said, I made sure I invested my time to make sure that I looked at what my faults were with what I didn't like about the charter, which is ward representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2640.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I realized<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2642.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm wrong for the fact that having that representation opens up having everybody in this community have a voice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2657.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, just bits and pieces that as my experience in the city school can remember, I think if we're going to move forward with the mayor being a voted member, it's imperative that whoever that man may be that they're in that leadership role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2674.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, for whatever it's worth, one out of seven people on a voting council that have seen just the rubber stamp that's moved forward, I hope the community understands as we move forward with the changes that my fellow colleagues keep bringing up,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2694.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is just damaging what this group has done so hard to bring to fruition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2701.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, thank you for your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=2704.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that many of you out there spent a lot of time to get the proper information out and vetted with the proper channels, but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3995.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3997.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I bring to the fact that it's contradictory to the fact that we support a strong mayor form of government, but at the same time, you want to cut their legs off and in a position where that holds the biggest budget in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4018.695s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In essence, what you're doing is putting the mayor to the side and saying,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4025.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to work with what we think is right and plow through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4029.507s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the checks and balances are gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4031.187s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's what happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4033.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've sat with three different mayors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4035.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've seen it happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4037.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And having a strong council with a strong mayor that's leading the city will pay dividends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4046.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, as I read a lot of what my colleagues on the school committee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4054.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: have said and what I've heard tonight is very simple that it seems like it's more ego driven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4060.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It seems like it's a little more power driven and I don't think it's really driven behind what's best for the school and the city because ultimately having the mayor chairing that committee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4074.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's that checks and balance, that person at the top that's saying, we know what the school committee needs, but at the same time, we have those balances from the city side, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4087.353s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what we have now by eliminating that process is truly eliminating a big piece of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4098.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, it's just,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4106.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's going to be interesting where the vote falls tonight, and it'll be interesting where the vote falls, the community as a whole, and then in the final vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4115.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's going to be interesting because, my mother used to say, if it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck, it's a duck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4125.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if you see the votes changing and you have six members all in tow, because that's what I've read so far from my colleagues across the board, it seems like everything is in tow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4138.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it reflects back to the ward representation piece that even from their platform, they've diverted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4148.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it's gone totally against what was originally created for a community group to do its due diligence and to see what they've done and brought forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4158.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not saying that we shouldn't make changes if we see changes, but so far what I've heard are really damaging changes for one demographic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4174.159s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'll be interesting to see how the vote goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=4177.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=5735.764s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Chairperson Sang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=5737.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that when it fits a dialogue, the speech can follow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=5746.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What to defend it when I have members of the revolution Medford responding that a platform that they ran on that my colleagues ran on clearly stated ward representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=5761.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one of the big things that as I started researching to change my mind, that helped me change my mind to what I needed to learn about ward representation, I thought was the piece that I think it's disingenuous to say that's not true, but to have a more diverse population and giving people an opportunity that normally wouldn't have the opportunity to run<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=5790.436s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in a system we have today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=5795.34s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So having every ward represented and my colleagues can say I'm wrong and say a lie to put words in their mouths, but it was said in the past that there are some wards that are so small that shouldn't be represented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=5808.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that I wanted to make sure when I went back and looked at that video, that that was said and understanding that what I believe Mr. Gimeno said is creating more life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=5820.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those wards that have been underrepresented are those wards that haven't come out to vote because they don't feel like they're part of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=5828.364s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They don't feel like they're part of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=5830.165s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's a huge divide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=5834.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just think that the key piece that keeps coming back in so many issues in our community is our, it's very simple that the question that keeps coming back<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=5850.93s">[Scarpelli]</a>: are the people that we elected, are the people that are sitting on the council floor, the people that are sitting in the school committee floor, are they really listening to us, the community, not 7500 people, not people like minded, but are they listening to the whole community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=5872.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this isn't divisive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=5874.437s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=5876.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like I said, like Lily Scarpelli said, quacks like a duck and walks like a duck, it's a duck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=5882.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You could follow the votes as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=5885.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it seems like it's ego driven and made to keep one group in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=5894.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because when you're flopping on what you promised and then you come back and belittle people in the sense that not understanding, using excuses or words, that that's what divides the community, not listening to the people that were put instead of this group and have worked so hard to do that, have listened to the professionals that sat with our leadership and our volunteers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=5919.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=5921.92s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It is what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=5923.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People aren't listening that are voting, that vote that represent you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=5927.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're just not listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=5931.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would stand against what my colleagues say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=5934.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You can have as many years of education on this topic as you want, but the bottom common sense failing of community and disengagement is evident with this vote and this, what we're hearing so far with all these changes that we've seen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=5951.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So listen, there's one Councilor that Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=5954.088s">[Scarpelli]</a>: McDonald, I've spoken to you directly and I can honestly look you in the eye and apologize because I let my ego get in the way when I was against charter review for the fact of the ward representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=5966.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But for one Councilor, I sat back and you realize when you talk to different groups and different people and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=5974.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, notwithstanding the respect the council that's of color on this council, but I've spoken to many people of color in our community that feel that they don't have a platform to run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=5985.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the way, and the ward representation is the avenue to run on the council side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=5992.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the format that was in place for the school committee as a former school member, like Mr. Gervino said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=6001.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's moving in the right direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=6004.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that really opens up and entices people to run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=6007.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's why it's important not to have all that lodge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=6011.756s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I see the benefit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=6013.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, if I can implore anything to my colleagues and the voters is that very simple, please listen to all residents, listen to everybody, have an open mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=6029.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because it's clear that that's not what we're getting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=9857.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=9858.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I feel that by any any motions to eliminate any avenue to have residents bring forth an issue of concern, I think is irresponsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=9875.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think my fellow council just mentioned that the reason that some of the former members of members of the Chatter Review Committee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=9882.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: so that maybe it was at a time when Councilors weren't listening, so they needed that platform.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=9887.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That still holds true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=9890.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that, like Councilor Bears said, there's gonna be sides, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=9896.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And having the opportunity for residents to petition and follow through the process the correct way, as written in the charter, I think that it doesn't limit the participation or the involvement of our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=9911.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would leave this alone, or again, it would be another example of what we've been seeing moving forward in the lack of really listening to our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=9923.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's what I'm seeing and what I'm hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=9928.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10375.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Capello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10376.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you to the point that we have public participation, but I'm hearing when it comes to a petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10383.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then it has to be heard on the floor, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10385.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's there's discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10387.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our public participation can't can't be discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10391.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's just Listened and then walk away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10394.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I see this as as as one of the reasons why I agree with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10399.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I also agree with 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10400.088s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would agree 50, maybe 50 people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10404.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: would be a more truer number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10405.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that gives you a new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10408.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I think I would do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10410.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But to eliminate this, I think would be a huge disservice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10437.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I believe the comments that have been used, I want to make sure that with this process, it's made to have an issue that's been put forth by, let's say, 50 signatures that they would be heard by this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10455.494s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, at that time, when it comes to this point,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10460.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this wouldn't be something that if the chair didn't feel comfortable with it, they would question the motion and move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10467.045s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This would be something that had to be heard, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10469.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so I think that's the difference with what my colleagues are saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10478.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10478.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that again, so again, what I'm hearing is that eliminate this because we don't we do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10484.035s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, it's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10485.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a this is a an avenue that if residents don't feel that they being heard, that they get the 50 somewhat signatures, they they present it to the clerk, they bring it to the podium, and then they have to be heard with a discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10500.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then they don't have to agree with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10502.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But then it has to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10503.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It has to be heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10504.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, like I said, I think it's important that this is an avenue that needs to be left in this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10510.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's why all other communities have this in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10514.949s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's because, again, it's an avenue for our residents to be heard when they think they're not being listened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=10521.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11270.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11271.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's coming in and out with different people but you didn't hear the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11275.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The motion is to strike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11290.187s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we're having issues with the Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11952.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11956.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Listened to my colleagues and colleagues in the school committee and we're elected officials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11964.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: people are gonna come to that podium, they're not gonna be happy with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11967.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what we ran for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11972.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have to understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11974.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not everybody's gonna come up and say what you wanna hear or they're gonna believe in what you have to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11978.65s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've dealt with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11980.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been sitting and doing what we've been doing here for the last few months and putting what my thoughts and processes are and then being thrown back and spit back in my face, but you have to take it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11991.541s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's part of the job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11994.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not limiting what we're trying to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11996.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's an open forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11998.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what government's about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11999.745s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talk about democracy and eliminating this for the sake of democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12005.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12006.268s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this, we keep saying we have public participation, we have public participation, but the experts with 40 years experience have expressed and shown us the difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12023.539s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that this doesn't happen often, but when it does, it's an avenue for our residents to come forward and have that ability to come forward through democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12035.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talk about, you know, we haven't made these changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12038.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We made no changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12040.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This council voted to have that open forum open four times a month to two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12046.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This council changed the process that we have public participation at the end of the agenda and people really can't talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12053.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whatever my fellow council say, it's not supposed to be debatable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12058.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then we talk about a time limit on when people can speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12062.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So don't give me the fact that we haven't done anything about limiting the process so we can do our business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12068.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done that, but that doesn't eliminate to get rid of the situation because you don't want to hear people that have an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12075.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's our jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12083.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And lastly, this isn't about you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12087.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and how you feel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12088.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is about the city's charter for today, tomorrow, 10 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12096.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the information that was gathered by a group of people that spent a lot of time figuring this out and then went through to the experts and then vetted that through the experts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12105.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, again, when we talk about, yeah, we have the right to sit here and talk about it and have an open discussion, this is probably the only question that I feel that there's an open discussion when it comes to the amount of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12118.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the representative from the Collins Senate said maybe 25 is a little low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12122.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 500 I think is too high.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12124.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But let's entertain changing that to 50 people and then vet it through our legal team to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12134.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think that's monumental.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12137.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that still leaves a reasonable option for our residents to be heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12143.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12146.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It doesn't eliminate democracy and silence people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12153.148s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I've heard undertones of, you know, people dictating fear and threats and what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12162.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Come on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12166.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a form of the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12168.311s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Michael Marx said it over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12170.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the people's form right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12171.792s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's their podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12173.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to limit it would be a total disrespect to this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12180.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12182.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would make the motion that we keep section eight in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12187.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We move forward by increasing the number to 50, and we put a stipulation that the petition has to be vetted through our legal team, because we don't know, because today we don't have a legal team, but in the charter review, maybe in 15 years we will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12207.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this process is set in place that the mayor has KP law that they have to answer to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12212.827s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that wouldn't be an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12215.209s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So right now that would be my form of emotion on this paper to move, to continue with moving forward but with the stipulations of increasing the numbers for the petition 50 and having it vetted by our legal team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12306.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12307.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Cavalli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12308.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12309.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just one quick comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12310.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I think it's important with the school committee piece to keep in as well as because the school committee has actually eliminated the public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12318.98s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They don't even have that option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12320.52s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They have a format in place where I believe you have to send the question to be approved through the council and then be allowed to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12329.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They first have to pass that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12331.663s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what you want to say, they have to read it and then approve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12335.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they're limited completely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12336.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So eliminating this with a school committee is even worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=12340.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=18541.164s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, as we're going through this, maybe my friends from the call center, I know we talked about in previous meetings that when we're talking about boards and commissions that we wanted to see that they had to be method residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=18554.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that in the section or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=18561.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=18564.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, so if we can make that a formal motion to make sure we add.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19267.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19272.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First of all, I think that looking at 20% to 25% of $160,000, that would increase the city council pay to, what, $40,000, $45,000 a year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19277.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19277.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council would be basically regret right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19303.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would not support this for the fact that I think that the council, I would rather see that the council make the motion of increasing a COLA raise after<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19318.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: all city bargaining units are compensated before they move forward to ask for, that we would ask for a raise, and then it would be implemented into the next election cycle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19335.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that, again, we're seeing a lot of good, bad faith in the last couple of years here, where we've seen union members<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19346.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: not getting paid I think the police now we're up to the rank and file I believe they're close to 900 days over 900 days, then the administration's over 1100 days or something so I mean you're looking at compensation and what we're looking for here is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19363.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's something to put this in effect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19368.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think there could be language that could be added with this and that the compensation would read that the council would vote for the upcoming an increase of COLA increase after their bodies have been compensated or their<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19387.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: their contracts have been ratified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19388.929s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that I would be more amended to something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19391.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just don't, um, and I don't think that when we're not seeing, we're not seeing most bodies, uh, union employees here from the city getting regular cold payments, every increases every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19406.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that this council shouldn't, shouldn't even entertain that right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19410.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like I said, and I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19412.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To be honest with you, I think that as we move forward, my motion would be to decrease our salaries for the fact that if we, when we go to ward representation, our jobs would drastically be different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19425.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that looking at your ward representation, it's a smaller area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19431.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, I personally, especially in the last couple of months, I've reached out and talked to maybe hundreds of people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19440.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: from all over the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19441.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that the compensation piece I think should reflect what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19447.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If our job title is now decreased for the amount of residents we're reaching out to, I think that our pay should reflect that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19458.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my recommendation would be a form of motion that we would cut our pay at least a third to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19465.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to reflect the job duties that would be changed in the, hopefully, in the, with the ward representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19476.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that would have to come probably closer to the community as a whole once we vet out<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19482.917s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the process, so I think that I just want that to be known.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19486.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I won't make it as a motion tonight, but we can add it in the night of the Committee of the Whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19490.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll make that a motion with the proper language to make sure that both the members, the union members in this community, and the residents realize that this council gets paid for the work they perform, and that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19508.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=20067.297s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=20067.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just to that, I think that's a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=20070.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can, before the Committee of the Whole, maybe if I can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=20077.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: request something to that point of what the wording would look like or if that's ever been done before when that type of a standard and chatter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=20090.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=20092.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=20093.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's like being in a hockey rink.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=20094.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know you probably think you're at one of your children's hockey games about 44 degrees in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=20100.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=20347.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's been a long time, but to our team, I think that in the Collins team, I think that I appreciate, you know, sitting through and bearing with the weather and everything you've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=20364.423s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that going through this process and seeing what, especially what you've done, Mr. McDonald,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=20370.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: so many people tried to do before and the efforts you put into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=20375.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that one thing I do talk about a lot is transparency and communication and making sure that everybody knows what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=20386.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And even as stuck as I was in my way, I think I had five to 10 phone calls from the child review committee just to get my viewpoint so they can understand it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=20398.695s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and then weigh it differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=20399.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that says a lot about what you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=20404.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that this community needs a lot more of a McDonald's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=20409.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=20411.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=20412.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=20417.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just to think you'll be moving on to another community soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1873.681s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, thank you, Madam Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1875.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1876.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My question is just general.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1878.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we're seeing this, some questions about one, I know that it looks like I think Councilor Leming shared the information to the public on the page so they can share that, because I'm getting texts that people couldn't find this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1895.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then the other question I have is, is it possible, Madam Chair, to work with NSF<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1901.373s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With with the residents trying to understand the process, I know we talked about this yesterday and making things a little bit streamlined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1909.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So people can understand it better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1912.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think 1 of the concerns right now is that the color of the, the, the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1916.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: distinctions between the different urban, uh, residential urban, um, you know, the, to separate them, it's yellow on yellow and orange.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1926.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So is there a way to help that later as we move forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1929.574s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just for, just for clarification purpose, so people can understand this a little bit better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1933.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, that's all I have, but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1948.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1951.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Could we, I just had a resident just text me, Madam Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1955.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe if Councilor Leming can share the ones that were sent today, because I think that, I don't know, I haven't looked at it, but some of the questions that might be,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1964.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The ones shared from an older slides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1968.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, if we can just look at that, that'd be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1971.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2041.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just wanted to share what we're hearing so I appreciate you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2044.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9197.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9200.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The simple answer is no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9202.69s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, unfortunately, what we just heard tonight is very simple that when we're looking at single family homes, we're now enticing developers to come in to buy single family homes at a market rate and then come in and put in high priced three family homes that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9225.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: will have no legal impact to make any of that affordable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9231.29s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So right now is what we're seeing it in some quarters like Mr. Gav will have some leeway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9238.574s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think it's simple answer is this zoning, especially we talked about tonight, will not support affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9248.92s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9392.016s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I could appreciate the on the hand insult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9394.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's ignorant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9395.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But to move forward very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9397.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The question from the gentleman was what we discussed tonight about zoning in our neighborhoods and what we heard with what was taught was spoken tonight and what we're looking at tonight was the quarters of the areas that focused on single<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9414.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: two-family, three-family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9415.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're talking about conversions of possible areas where the one-families will not be implemented anymore, and that's where we lend to developers to come in to purchase those long-time one-family homes, to develop three-family homes, and not having any right of making any of those affordable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9441.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think I haven't said anything out of turn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9444.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I've shared with the council yesterday, Councilor Leming, was very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9450.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Residents don't understand the process because they haven't been informed, hence again this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9457.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we move forward this evening, we were given documents an hour before<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9463.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And residents didn't know anything about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9465.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm getting text messages now because the area of Tufts University in the train station, no one in that neighborhood has heard of the impact now that that's going to affect their area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9476.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you can use your underhanded little sly insults as much as you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9481.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because it hurts because you think you know it all but nothing what you said is true what you all said was very simple you said there are other avenues that we can use for affordable housing i didn't deny that but the question was what we talked about this evening is there anything in there that supports affordable housing and the answer is simple it's no whether i'm a zoning expert or not Councilor because seamlessly you think you are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9510.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate it, Madam Chairperson, but the insults, that's irresponsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9709.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That'll never happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9721.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not hiding from that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9722.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not hiding from that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9723.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're hurting homeowners with those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9726.261s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Two wrongs don't make a right, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9942.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just a point of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9943.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate it, Madam Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9946.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate Councilor Leming bringing that forward because I was one of the Councilors that supported Councilor Falco's original initial push for the Affordable Trust Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9958.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9961.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we try to, so we understand sometimes that the people in other offices slow the process down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9969.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's one process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9972.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We feel very proud that we can move forward to supporting our efforts in affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9979.258s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=10011.079s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hurting more people, Zach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=10012.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: more people than you think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=10039.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So keep building zoning to help those developers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2653.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2656.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is the petitioner here this evening or on Zoom?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2709.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a representative from Boba Tea, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2724.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2724.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2725.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2727.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We see everything in order, but before we move forward, do you have anything to say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2730.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that it seems like it's just a simple transfer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2733.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're keeping the business the same, but just turning over the ownership?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2738.981s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that what I see?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2743.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, you'll be changing the name?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2744.563s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2745.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, but it seems like the hours of operations don't change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2748.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have everything in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2750.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see everything in order, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2751.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Move forward approval and wish him good luck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2795.221s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2795.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2796.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, if I can, just a quick update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2805.911s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2806.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know the council had some suggestions a few weeks ago with our process when it comes to licensing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2812.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had a great discussion with council being with some opportunities that other communities use in moving that forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2822.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that we have a few ideas that I know that council president's working to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2831.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2831.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Look into the legalities and possibly streamline the processes so we can that the hope is that if maybe going to subcommittee and then talk about the process where it's either biweekly or is needed that we meet half hour before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2848.261s">[Scarpelli]</a>: City Council meetings in the side<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2859.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the resident would have to stay, the business owner would have to stay, but as we could see most of the time, we could streamline things and move them forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2867.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they're not paying attorney's fees and people staying here for an extra four hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2872.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate the council bringing the question forward and pushing this along with Councilor Beguin for his support and his guidance with this and look for something coming down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2885.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2940.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2941.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And thank you for Councilors Leming and Callahan, who actually<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2945.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: started this process with some residents that were looking to increase programs for our disabled community and we had discussions with the parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2958.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've met with both directors from Medford and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2962.372s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Malden, Somerville together starting a collaborative and a pilot program with the three communities, enhancing our programming for our disabled youth and adults.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2977.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as we went forward and looking what the needs are for the, as we move forward with this process, we realized that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2985.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: having a subcommittee for Education and Cultural Committee to focus on the true needs of what the Recreation Department needs coming to budget season and calling for that meeting hopefully on February 25th before our regular scheduled meeting and then meeting with the parents who I spoke with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3007.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: yesterday making sure that they understand the process and then possibly working to create a committee with the parents and gathering information to see what our community really needs and what they're looking for and working collaboratively with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3025.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So hopefully we get to a resolution in February and we hope to have programs up and running by April 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3035.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3202.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, I know that yesterday there was a community meeting for the Salem Street neighbors in the community at the Roberts and people that were there really got to share some of their<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3221.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't wanna use, you can use frustration would be a good word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3226.351s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I don't wanna beat a dead horse and I don't want to keep bringing this up, but I think we have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3233.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that one thing that's been coming back and forth is that understanding the zoning when it comes to posting information and what is coming up in future meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3248.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3249.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for a Councilor or zoning specialists, it's easy because it's in your pipeline and you are accustomed to the language and you can really understand it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3262.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I asked a while back if we could, you really work with our consultant to try to find a way that we can, I don't wanna say, probably just a layman's terms, so people can understand the zoning<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3279.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and with better verbiage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3284.115s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's not so complicated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3286.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that yesterday's frustration, as I talked to neighbors this morning, as I talked to neighbors last night, residents last night, I think the biggest concern is really the speed and the process where last night was impressive in the fact that at least they saw what was going on in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3306.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They got to touch things see things, and then they got to go to those boards and post what they wanted to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3314.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think this is something again that I brought up for years now, and I can revert back to previous council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3324.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we looked into doing the RFP process, working with the RFP process is really as it was written back in the day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3333.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think I showed the council that the minutes that those meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3337.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that the RFP asked for the consultant that we were bringing in, the partners were bringing in to really have a detailed plan that would go into the neighborhood for communication and having the neighbors feel as part of the process and share the input as you get started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3357.681s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, last night's efforts were great, but that's what we were talking about that we do at the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3366.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and as we're moving forward the process I and believe me I understand what my council has been saying we've had over 20 some odd meetings and and and the word is we've tried to get the word out but unfortunately when we have the issues that have come about on Salem Street and the lack of what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3387.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: our residents feel like they're not being listened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3390.436s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's important that we listen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3392.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so I would make a motion that we would ask to, you know, I know that we halted the meeting for March, but I would actually ask to suspend that for another month and maybe go back to that court or go back to the Roberts<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3411.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: bring meetings in and just reset the clock with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3414.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not where it's coming in and people telling me how wrong it is or how bad this is, but just resetting and understanding and having that open process before we go to the next step and say, hey, this is more in depth and this is what we've been asking for, to really understand what we want in the corridor, as they should say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3433.756s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know some neighbors say it's not a corridor, it's in their neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3437.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's important if we can do that because I, again, because as I follow it up, I don't see a timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3444.202s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think there is a timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3445.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we've been waiting a long time and I know that this council and people have worked really hard and I don't want to discredit that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3452.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please believe me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3453.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think, especially when we talk about the Salem Street Corridor, it seems like it's a lightning rod right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3459.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's created such a negative buzz that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3464.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if there's a way that this council can lead in working with Ennis and working with Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3470.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hunt's office and try to find a more robust way to go back into that neighborhood and sit down and listen and post.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3479.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think because that's what we did yesterday, a lot of people did feel comfortable with posting and seeing that, you know, they could put something on a board and understand what that's about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3488.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3490.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Resetting that giving a little bit more time I think it'll be, it will be so important for healing, and it'll be very important to moving forward in this community as we go through this process because I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3504.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't a meeting to say I told you so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3506.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to say that but I just think that it's important that we listen because this hasn't been touched in many, many years and we know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3514.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there was comment yesterday that was made by Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3516.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hunt that she said that during this meeting she thought that everybody was there that was against zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3522.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the truth of the matter is the people that I've talked to, they weren't against zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3527.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they were against the process of the zoning hearings and how it's gone through and how they feel like they weren't heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3534.456s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because something simple, and you were there, Council President,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3538.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the simple piece of the biggest, one of the biggest fear we heard was that the methanol clinics and trying to avoid putting medical buildings in that corridor to avoid the concerns that neighborhood had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3550.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's something we can revisit if it was started from the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3554.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it wasn't, you know, there were some people that were upset that, you know, the size of the buildings, but I think the messaging was a lot clearer that people understand where, what's gonna go where and where,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3567.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: some stories going to go six stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3568.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was clarification on some map changes that we saw that really clarified and help people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3574.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that if we could, if we can, if there's one thing that I would ask as form of motion is if we can see if we can just delay the process and hold a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3592.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a meeting at the Roberts with the neighbors that would be a listening session and more of a partnership to see what do the neighbors want, not a negative or antagonistic battle with their side, our side, but sit there and present it the way that, and has presented it in the sense that allowed the people to get up<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3619.171s">[Scarpelli]</a>: talk to people in person to sit there and tangible and put a sticky on the on the note on the board and say, this is what I want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3626.913s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think it's important because I think that no matter how much work and people have done a lot of work I'm not going to, I'm not going to deny that that there are a lot of people doing a lot of work and spend a lot of time<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3639.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that it's important that we understand as a council that the residents don't feel like they're being listened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3647.609s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's not meant to be a disrespectful comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3653.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's really made to enlighten us to say, hey, nothing's happened yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3658.913s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have to rush for anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3660.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's reset this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3661.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's go into that corridor and let's become partners with the neighbors of Salem Street<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3666.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and put everything on the table and understand as we move forward, there was nothing that we pushed through or you leave all the negativity behind and say, we did this the way we should have done it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3678.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think it's important because I, again, I've done that and I've talked to a lot of professionals that have talked about this process and other communities as professionals, whether they're zoning consultants, attorneys, or worked for different municipalities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3696.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this is the difference with what we've done so far and where the gaps are and where the cries are from the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3703.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I appreciate the time to listen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3706.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that in totality, I think that's probably the biggest thing that I've heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3710.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that last night's meeting kind of answered some things, but I think the two biggest things that if we can come out of it is if there's a way that we could possibly work with our consultants to try to find<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3726.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a way to simplify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3728.98s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what those changes are and what we're really doing in those corridors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3732.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's not these maps that are real tiny so people can understand them a little bit better and just bullets where I hate to say it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3741.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Someone said to me, yes, this is Georgia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3743.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm 78 years old, and I just don't understand all this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3747.088s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is so confusing to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3748.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What does this mean for my house and my future here in Metroton?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3753.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I couldn't answer them because it's specific to the area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3758.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: between that and the speed of the process, and maybe asking to do a little bit more teamwork with the neighbors, I think would go a long way for both this council and our vision together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3770.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because again, it's not that people in the room were against everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3775.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They weren't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3776.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was the pace and not understanding the fear, I think, that was something we need to correct if we could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3784.423s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4788.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4789.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4792.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I reiterate what residents have said, they understand that they're all in, they understand that we need some changes, things haven't been looked at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4800.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's a common cry, you hear that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4804.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that again, I appreciate the effort, but again, I think the biggest piece that we're missing is truly listening to what they're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4813.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our residents using Salem Street an example,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4819.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because this is the area that we're working on right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4822.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the hotbed that they want to be part of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4826.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They want to go into the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4829.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They want to do what we were forced to do last night, but come back full circle and do it the correct way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4835.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To say that, you know, I know that Councilor Collins said that it's breaking a contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4842.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, it isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4843.911s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It is not that the consultants work for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4846.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've already changed the timeline for four other different reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4851.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's not a true statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4855.47s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If there was legalities in that, then we should ask for a change order in that contract because it will be easily done if we truly want to fulfill what the residents are asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4869.999s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think it's very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4871.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have a motion in place and I hope my council support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4876.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we delayed the process of the Salem Street zoning until we hold neighborhood partner involved meetings with our partners in Ennis and our development board<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4890.888s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and working together to move that corridor forward in a positive light.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4895.792s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate that we're now finally moving into more streamlined, more transparent and understandable process so people understand zoning as a fifth grader.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4906.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think it's important that we're missing the biggest piece here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4912.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to go into these communities, we need to go into these corridors, we need to go into that community and have them feel like they're part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4921.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even though the questions were answered, there's still a lot of animosity and there's still a lot of confusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4928.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there's a lot of great ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4930.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sure that all of you have talked to some very, very brilliant people, as I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4934.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've talked with people that are in the field that have worked at the highest universities in the country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4944.888s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they've worked on huge projects and small projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4949.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they live in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4951.313s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they've shared some great ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4952.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4954.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those are the people that live in those areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4957.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that it would be important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4960.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would make the motion that we ask for the delay, we go through the process correctly, and we ask to bring a meeting to work together with the residents of each quarter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4972.78s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=298.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With that being said, oh, Councilor Strunk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=303.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The biggest discussions that are still left out there is this won't be discussed tonight just for clarification would be the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=312.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The composition 2-1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=355.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=355.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=356.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=356.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just, I just have clarification because I, I think that was the confusion, Matt, Mr. Chair, that, so again, you just confused me right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=366.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So did we vote on anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=369.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we doing the seven that Zach said?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=371.859s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we, have we eliminated the option of, of at lodge for all eight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=376.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the question that people were very confused when they left the other day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=415.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, just to share with the Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=417.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the conversation I've had with multiple community members and community groups with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=423.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The question was, if this is voted, then moved on to the mayor's office, the mayor has the option to deny that and request the original format, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=437.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or will that stop the process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=440.92s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because again, we're trying to work this so we can get this to the legislation, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=446.164s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So our legislators that I've talked to aren't very happy that we're moving against what their constituents are reaching out to them about what we're doing here, what was done at that vote, and what was done with the review committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=459.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that that's going to be something we can talk to at that next meeting, but I want to be clear that residents<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=467.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: feel like they're not informed enough to understand the process as we're rushing through this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=471.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they want to know, is there a stop?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=474.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if they feel like they're not being listened to us, the question is, can the mayor, maybe the calling center can help us, can the mayor stop the process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=483.949s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If she doesn't feel that this is what is best for the city, she can not allow this to move forward to the legislation, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=554.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we invite all of our state legislators here because I think it's important because their constituents are reaching out to them because I know that one state representative sat down with me and wanted to miss the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=566.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So he wanted to know what was going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=568.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So he's a little confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=569.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can have that as a form of emotion, but if we could just put that as a, just a bookmark, just so that we understand that for the residents that are listening,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=582.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what this council votes on and then moves forward, the mayor then has the option to say, uh, nope, we're not going to send this to the legislation legislators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=590.582s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not going to send this to the state for vote to get this on the ballot, or she can veto and pick what she feels is the best choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1127.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, thank you, Council Vice President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1131.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1134.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't, I find it a little disturbing and I appreciate the movement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1141.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that as I've been stating from the beginning of this process is that we're seeing what people have said years ago in bringing these meetings into the neighborhoods and we see the situation with the Salem Street corridor and what's happened there and I appreciate the extra meetings but I really think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1162.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we need to take a more proactive approach moving on with other zoning areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1169.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, even just to share because unfortunately, sometimes people seem to think on the council that I'm trying to stir apart or be negative all the time, but I'm receiving emails and the residents have questions, questions that I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1186.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: like Salem Street could have been answered at meetings that I requested at the beginning and being glad to see that we're finally moving to the Roberts into the neighborhoods because people aren't, although these are public meetings, people aren't getting the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1202.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can see that by the mayor's letter that she sent out stating that she's now going to involve her communications team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1211.822s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that should be hand in hand moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1214.582s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I only say this for the fact that as we move forward to the neighborhood, the residential neighborhood zoning where people have already started calling saying, George, is it true that the Lawrence estates is now going to have 2 or 3 families and it's going to change the look of our community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1230.77s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And these are questions that are so simple to answer, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1236.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the access to these meetings or even understanding these meetings or, um, understanding what, um, information that people in, uh, in the community can access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1249.436s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's easy for us because we do this every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1253.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But, um, again, um, you know, like I said, the biggest, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1262.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The most unified comments we had when we first started the recodification of the zoning was as we bring it to the next step is really having that RFP beefed up to make sure that we have a robust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1273.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh, communication avenue into the areas that we are looking to rezone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1280.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So residents can be part of the process, not reactionary, like we're seeing across the neighborhood, um, across the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1290.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just implore to my colleagues and, um, and, um, our director and Ennis that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1298.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We start thinking a little proactive and start moving into the neighborhoods as we move these meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1303.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, we've, we've had meetings in the past where we've gone to the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1307.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've gone to both the middle schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1310.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've gone to many different locations to make sure that we're bringing the message to the neighbors and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1319.035s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, the neighbors and what I'm hearing already that there's coalitions, neighborhood coalitions that are starting that already starting to talk about how they're going to go in and and battle the city because of lack of information going into our next next phases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1336.045s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1338.579s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to, I just want to inform you this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1340.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1342.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know some consoles would think that this is a, you know, Council Scarpelli being negative again but again, as one Councilor like I mentioned the last few meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1352.424s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm getting those emails from the residents that feel like they're not being heard by by our.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1357.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council and by our city administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1360.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, again, I'm glad the mayor stepped up and started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1368.016s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And putting some processes with her communication team for sale, I implore you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1373.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to contact the mayor, bring her communication team in as we move forward with these processes, because again, we all know this hasn't been looked at in many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1384.888s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And from what we're hearing with what people feel in Salem Street, again, like I said, when you talk about residents from Lawrence Road and the Lawrence Estates, and they're frightened that the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1396.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: their quaint neighborhoods are not going to be changed to have the possibility of jamming in three family homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1402.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know where they're getting this information, but this is the, um, this is because of lack of notification and lack of, um, community participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1412.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, again, I've said this 1000 times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1415.304s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know Council vice president has done Yeoman's work in putting the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1421.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh council meetings in order organizing them all but unfortunately it's just not uh it's just not getting to the community and i'm afraid we're going to be stalled uh zone after zone as we keep moving forward until we really put a comprehensive plan in place so thank you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5185.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5186.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My hands been up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5186.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5187.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just so you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5188.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5196.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5197.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's difficult being on zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5198.98s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want, I don't want to get too far away from what, what I represented for minutes said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5203.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I just wanted to share a text message that I appreciate, uh, her clearing that up that right away, the residents saying, hold it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5212.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're so confused because what we're looking at right now on, um, on the shared, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5218.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: videos that really can't even see what these areas and neighborhoods look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5224.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So just rest assured, I believe that we're not going to take anything of a vote or anything that's going to be moving anything in any direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5234.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think what we're asking for is to revisit and look at some options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5237.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we could just clarify that, Council Vice President, that'd be important for the viewing public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5244.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5275.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5276.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5276.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5277.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't mean to disrespect and cut you off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5279.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just wanted to make sure I didn't get too far so we could clarify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5283.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1213.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1217.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, sometimes time heals all wounds, and I think having these two weeks really allowed our residents to reach out to our assessor and then really grasp the understanding of what's been happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1228.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that, Councilor Bealz, you've done a great job really educating a lot of people that have contacted me in the breakdown of what the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1240.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what the tax implication looked like and making sure they understand the numbers are correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1246.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the biggest concern was the knowledge of not understanding the impact of the, you don't want to say, you know, retro, you don't want to use the word retro, but it started back as of July 1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1265.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when people saw their taxes in such a huge increase, they saw<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1269.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the quarters that started from July 1 and then their updated assessments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1275.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's what really played a huge impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1278.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that, unfortunately, it's I see a lot of very dejected residents, especially senior citizens and homeowners and renters that I've talked to because they've<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1293.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: had great relationships with their homeowners and their landlords, and they realize this implication now is going to come down, and everybody's going to feel some pain with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1304.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And like I've said from the get-go, I wasn't against the process if we need an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1311.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it was educating and informing our residents to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1316.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let them know, have them be prepared for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1320.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when you're talking about a senior citizen on Lawrence Road, a young lady who called me and said that, George, my tax bill this month is $2,800, and living on a fixed income, she doesn't know how.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1333.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: she's going to be able to pay $2,800.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1334.636s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Doesn't, when I tell you fair, and that's just been a common, common cry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1340.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that, you know, I, I appreciate the assessor's office cause they've been super attentive to anybody who's we've shared and they've called, but I think we need to find other avenues as a council to really, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1358.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: really educate our residents, especially the most vulnerable and understanding where maybe it's not one offs, but maybe the man's communication team with the finance director with the city assessor that they can truly understand<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1374.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the different options and what's coming down the line in their next tax bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1381.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something simple as understanding what an abatement is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1383.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I had a great conversation with the former president of the Massachusetts Association.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1390.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was great in understanding the process with the abatement and making sure our residents understand that there is an application process<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1398.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But understanding it's not an automatic free savings or support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1403.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It has to I think our residents have to understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1407.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have to go prepared when you go to the assessor, making sure that you bring comparable numbers that you see in homes that are sold in your area, and making sure they're apples to apples, meaning they are relatively the same age of a home, making sure that they're aligned with, when you say three bedrooms, two baths.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1428.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's a true balance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1431.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: preparation for that assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1432.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that, uh, talk to the city assessor that's on the assessor's page for the abatement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1438.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that we have, especially with our senior homeowners and disabled and our veterans, I think that what I would request is really, um, with this whole process and is, is really put together as for a, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1455.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: subcommittee and planning permitted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1457.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's super busy, but trying to find a way that we have a meeting to bring people in and maybe work with the mayor to set up a listening session that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1467.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: residents can come here maybe Wednesday night or Friday mornings and just have someone explain to them so they can understand and prepare.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1474.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, I know we've already talked, I've talked to many residents and said that this council is going to be proactive starting in the budget season looking at homeowner exemption this year, something we've never done in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1486.574s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And something that the former president of the cess association says, you know, that was in the past, that was voodoo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1491.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You just didn't do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1493.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he said, where you are right now, especially in the situation,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1496.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: he thinks that it's something that we should be looking at very strongly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1499.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as he broke down a lot of the numbers for me, I would concur.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1504.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that looking at other exemptions and asking our state delegation to see how we can maybe look at any other forms of exemptions for our seniors, whether it be through the state or other supports federally that can help with this, I think it's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1522.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1524.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're seeing so much with our business community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1527.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that they've been getting their butts kicked, something that I'll talk about with the next resolution I put forth with parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1537.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're seeing so many things put on now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1539.202s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The business community, there has to be something so they're prepared as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1543.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've talked to one business owner who has been committed to the city of Medford for over 40 years, and he's been a very good landlord to many businesses in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1555.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: he finds himself prepared for the fact that he has six years left on a lease for six of his businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1563.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he's seen an increase of over $20,000 to $40,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1567.261s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And these are the things that he's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1573.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's wealthy in the sense compared to you or I probably, but someone who stayed in the city and just didn't sell these buildings to big developers and didn't move away, but stayed true to the small businesses in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1590.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those are the businesses that we really want to try to protect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1592.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not the Starbucks of the world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1594.584s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not the Coca-Cola's or the Budweiser's of the world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1598.859s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are our mom and pop stores that we wanna talk about really supporting and keeping those businesses open in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1605.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, so with all these, I think it would be beneficial for us as a council to really call for a subcommittee for planning permitting committee that could talk with, maybe bring in the mayor's team with administration, the city assessor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1627.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the finance director and ask how we can at least find a path that we can educate and help us in sharing any way we can support our most vulnerable in any avenue we can take financially, whether it be, like I said, a more robust exemption for our seniors or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1649.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, understanding and completing the abatement process to help save some money there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1654.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, the abatement process, because I've talked to some seniors, and like, if I get it, then they don't have to pay taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1661.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's like, no, no, that's not it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1663.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's understanding the abatement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1664.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I tried to explain to them, if your home is valued, is assessed at $1 million, possibly with the abatement, it might be assessed at $800,000 if it's accepted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1677.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: depending on what you see with neighboring comps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1680.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that was something that was very interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1682.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, you know, like I said, for me, one of the Councilors stood strong against the override for these facts alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1693.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is where now you're seeing the impact, just like we're seeing the impact on our federal government, we're seeing in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1702.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: most major communities in this country that people aren't prepared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1711.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that we weren't prepared for the solar ride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1714.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We really didn't prepare our most vulnerable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1717.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if we can do something to recover that, I would hope this council would support me in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1721.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1801.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whatever you feel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1802.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1803.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, whatever you feel more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2548.107s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, President Villescaz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2550.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's sad that it seems like everything Councilor Scarpelli is gonna put forth has a negative connotation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2556.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm a little disappointed in my colleague that, again, this has nothing, this is what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2562.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And by Councilor Tseng bringing forth the process of this being some sort of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2568.223s">[Scarpelli]</a>: political, whatever, whatever comment you made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2571.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the biggest issue you want to talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2574.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You want to talk about unifying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2576.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're just not listening to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2578.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This resolution was put forth because the community feels that the city administration didn't do enough work to educate our most vulnerable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2586.91s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's funny how you just want to spin it back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2588.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's dividing just, just so you know, this is what the community keeps calling me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2595.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and saying, why does it always have to be opposite?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2602.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why can't you just understand that what I put out here is very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2607.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's very precise in understanding that this is what the community has called, this is what they wanted me to express, that they weren't informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2617.268s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to sit there that this is a divide, of course it's a divide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2622.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't done anything lately that hasn't had an issue with communication, lack of communication, lack of transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2631.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's been across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2632.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have you been involved in the last five meetings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2635.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything that we've gotten with the mayor sitting here talking to us and trying to throw smoke screens at us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2646.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to last week's meeting with charter review to tonight to the to the override, like I said, and not again, the override questions biggest thing was transparency and educating our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2656.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to turn this around again to be you know let's let's make a political again we just made a political Justin and tell you what.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2663.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: keep doing what you're doing because that's what's dividing this community because it's a lack of communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2667.705s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People feel that this council just isn't listening and all if all you did tonight was just went through the vote and we took two votes and we voted yes we would have had something positive going on tonight but instead we got to come back to this and say that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2683.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that this was meant in some sort of political negative way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2687.98s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Listen to what the city is saying, not your city, the complete community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2693.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're saying we're not listening to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2696.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, President Pierce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3419.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, Mr. President, where, as we have received, I have received multiple phone calls, emails with misunderstanding and confusion from fear of the tax increase from recent tax bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3439.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So some of those people were parents as well with kids in school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3444.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Some of those people were senior citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3447.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Some of those people were renters that were gonna be affected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3451.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what I stated in my resolution is exactly what the residents shared with me to share as a resolution on the council floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3464.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If this council wants to go through again and not listen to what they're saying, because of course this override is gonna help<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3475.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: financially help the schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3476.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Of course it would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3479.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nobody said it wouldn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3480.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The question we were saying throughout this process is slow the process down so we can educate people on the outcome and how it affects everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3493.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So sure, $7.5 million is going to help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3496.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Of course it's going to help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3499.768s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And just a little tidbit, in the Melrose situation, they were promised<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3505.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: support for the school department, the first two overrides they had, and the first two overrides that were passed, the Melrose public school systems failed miserably.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3515.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the third time, the citizens finally rose up and said, no way, not again, because they just didn't prove it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3523.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So every side has a story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3525.911s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, Mr. President, we'll go through the vote again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3529.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: By the will of the people, by the will of this council, we'll vote yay and nay, and we'll move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3534.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3535.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, just another example by the comments of my fellow councilors, that they're just not listening to the other side that feel like they're being heard here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3547.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because you're talking out of both sides of your mouth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3548.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're saying, yes, they need support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3551.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, we didn't educate them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3552.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But yes, but you're too harsh on this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3556.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is their resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3557.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3642.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you Mr. President again this is uh<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3646.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that was brought up by the residents of South Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3649.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that they're seeing such a negative impact in their day-to-day living conditions because of some of these processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3661.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that we have a new director of parking, and it would behoove this council, I think, to maybe sit with them<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3676.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: move this to a planning and permitting committee that has the traffic protocol under there so we can maybe talk and look at and understand the G-Zone parking program, the pilot program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3689.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that with that process and the appeals process that's in place right now here in Medford, we're finding that residents are very, very frustrated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3702.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3704.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to have an avenue for our residents to express themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3708.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we're seeing right now is the mayor is using traffic and parking as another revenue source.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3716.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, that's on the back of our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3720.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's just not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3721.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're seeing time and time again, Mr. President, that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3724.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with increased fees, increased fines, no appeals process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3729.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've talked to a few neighboring communities, talked to their commissioners, their traffic and parking directors, and I gave them scenarios.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3737.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One scenario was a senior citizen who parked behind<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3743.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Colleen's and unfortunately, she left her handicapped placard on her dashboard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3748.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She didn't hang it on the rear view mirror.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3750.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When she came out, she received a ticket, I believe it was 1201.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3754.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She got in her car, she drove to the parking department at 1210 and said, this is the situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3761.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm handicapped, this is my placard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3764.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, I didn't hang it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3765.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they said, you can appeal it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3767.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they were generous enough to help her appeal it out front, to walk through the appeal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3771.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: By the time she got home, she was notified that the appeal didn't go through, and she'd have to pay the ticket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3778.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She called City Hall, and I believe at the time, the Chief of Staff was overseeing the process, and her words directly were, there's no gray area here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3789.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's either yes or no, and that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3793.705s">[Scarpelli]</a>: neighboring communities, you've talked to their commissioners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3795.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, there are gray areas and there are options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3799.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the next option on the appeal would have to go to the courts and on $150 ticket, this resident would then have to pay $250 to then appeal this at the next level so someone can listen to her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3812.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, one of the most vulnerable members of our community not being heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3818.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3820.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That followed up with many residents of South Medford calling me and saying, George, listen, I drive my car on the weekends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3828.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And sometimes I have to take it out if I need it for work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3832.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But then when I come home, I realize that the G-Zone is now permitted to people that aren't residents of Medford because they bought a pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3842.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they're seeing the anger and the frustration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3845.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're talking about situations with the business community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3851.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: residents we're talking about supporting our businesses right our local businesses well now let's say you own a real estate company you in medford square you now pay for that pass which is 150 or 125 you pay for that in the past that was good throughout the city now you have to now buy another pass fee to get permitted and then if you have to show a house let's say in west medford so there's so many inequities here and it seems like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3879.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We want to save small businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3881.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We want to support our business community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3882.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But in the same breath, we're putting in these hurdles and roadblocks and hurting what we're looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3890.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have to remember, when the Traffic and Parking Department was implemented, it was made to really support the business community and keeping<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3902.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: non-residents from parking, especially on the one-on-one route or the bus route that goes to the express bus, and parking there all day in front of a business, and then these outsiders take a spot for the whole entire day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3915.839s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now in South Metro, from what I'm being told from the neighbors, there are cars that people don't live in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3921.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They get parking, they walk to the green line, they're gone all day, their car's in front of their house, and then they come home, they don't have parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3929.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because we've then, you know, we've sold their spot, we've rented their spot in front of their home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3935.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's a lot of concerns, you know, there are so many others that come to mind that I think that we really need to sit down with the traffic department and the new director and get some clarity so we can help these residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3950.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, like, again, I think the G zone, it has to be some clarity in where the pilot program's going from here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3959.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The appeals process that there has to be something in place that someone in-house walks through, at least looks at an appeal, that it's something that's blatant that could support our resident, especially most vulnerable, that we have that in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3974.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We look at our business community and even invite Chamber of Commerce to that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3980.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to the meeting if we can, Mr. President, to a subcommittee meeting and get their input to see where we're going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3986.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that these are very important issues and I hope this council will support me, at least with this one, that we ask to go to a subcommittee meeting in planning and permitting to see what we can do to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3999.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: educate ourselves, help educate the community, and then at the same time add any input that we can that at least the homework that I've done from neighboring communities that were very, very simple, simple ads that really, really could change a lot and really support our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4019.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4438.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, maybe instead of everybody seems to be interested, maybe we do do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4445.584s">[Scarpelli]</a>: regular scheduled meetings from six to seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4447.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe we ask the traffic commission, any member that would like to join, because I think maybe that might be an option to revisit and update those processes as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4458.096s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I know that Somerville does have one of the councils on the commission, so they're sharing what they're hearing directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4467.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that'd be important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4468.756s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that'd be my recommendation if you so see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4471.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4898.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4899.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that, uh, I know that, uh, Councilor Began, um, sent you a message and you forwarded it to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4907.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4908.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, um, he mentioned that, uh, the town of Beverly has an option that maybe, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4915.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we could maybe enhance or help streamline the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4919.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm going to meet with him hopefully tomorrow or Thursday to see what suggestions he might have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4927.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I don't disagree that sometimes the business owners that come here for an approval<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4936.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and they're there with an attorney that they're paying by the hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4941.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I could see that as an issue, but unfortunately with, and I think this is a question for another day of discussion and battling, but sitting in meetings, long meetings until everybody's heard at that podium, that's our job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4961.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whether we like it or not, we're elected, that's part of our job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4964.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So even if you don't like to hear what people are saying, because I, too, don't like sometimes what people are saying, but you have to respect the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4973.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if it's taking us to 1130, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4976.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's important that people understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4979.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I, too, agree that this process is already in place that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4982.953s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4986.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: having this meeting tomorrow, maybe shed some light.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4988.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe there's something I can bring back to the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4991.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll email you with some suggestions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4993.051s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we see anything that's fruitful, that would maybe streamline our process that they do in other communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4999.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'd love to see that if we can help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5001.236s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6735.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have to pay, basically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6736.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They use it as a rental.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6740.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, goes to the rec department, which then adds so we can provide programming for the youth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7749.453s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll turn it on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7754.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's first that the council gives up custody to the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7762.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's the first thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7765.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: OK, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7810.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7810.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7811.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7812.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just, because I'm really confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7813.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the way that it's read that the council has the authority right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7818.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we are the ones that allow that, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7822.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we're now getting the authority to do that, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7826.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think this is a good, you know, it's a good step, I think, especially when you're looking for funding the Affordable Housing Trust and looking at avenues that we're looking to support, you know, the unhoused and looking for different avenues and then also looking at a housing shortage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7847.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, can we amend this, I think, Council Vice President, that it's important that I know that when this started discussions some time ago, one of the biggest concerns, and I've got some phone calls from people on Laforma Gap, mentioned that, is there a way that we can add, the Council can add,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7867.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: giving the mayor the authority, but also making sure that the residents that abut these properties have right of first refusal, because I think that that's what their biggest fear is, is that if a resident that abuts this land right now, if they can take, if they can benefit from that and have control of what goes on next door to them for the house they bought,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7894.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when this wasn't in effect, I think it's important that this council protects those residents that abut these opportunities that they have the right of first refusal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7906.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Does that make sense, Vice President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7908.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that if council ever can assist us with that, I think it'd be important that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7914.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For one, I would make that a formal motion that moving forward, I think that this is something I would support, but I think that what was said and what was mentioned in the past, and again, what was reiterated from the residents of McCormick Gap is that they have the right of first refusal, the abutters of that land.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8003.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8003.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, so to reiterate legally, we can't ask for that motion obviously now that, uh, and I think this is the biggest fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8012.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that what we're seeing is developers are going to jump on that and they're going to, they're going to come in, they're going to swoop in and all of a sudden they're going to change the face of that neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8022.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So unfortunately I, I, without that support, I don't think I can, I can support doing this because again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8029.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're now allowing something that's so good, that can be so beneficial, that I don't think, I don't know if I can support that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8039.107s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Council Vice President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=697.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=699.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=700.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I first want to acknowledge the fact that as one councilor, I was, when I first started my journey as a city councilor, I was firmly behind the charter change charter review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=712.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as we started moving forward and we started seeing some of the changes and what it can impact, my biggest<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=719.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The piece that really turned me around to vote against the charter review at the time was really looking at ward representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=727.792s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think it's because of working in a community that has ward representation and really having some situations where you saw<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=739.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the input of ward representation being looked at in some cases as special interests from section of the city to section of the city, but not what's best for the whole community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=750.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I found myself being very stubborn and stuck on my beliefs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=755.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what I think I needed to do was take a step back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=759.065s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that reading all the information that Mr. McDonald's team has done with the charter review and talking to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=767.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Jovino and different members of the committee and then reaching out to different colleagues from neighboring communities that have ward representation and truly understanding the positive impacts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=780.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that I was so narrow-minded, my thinking at the time was so narrow-minded that I really need to expand and really look at the greater picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=789.47s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as I see this presentation, I realized that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=795.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, if I could turn the clock back and if I could have helped by moving this forward back a few years ago when the commitment for the council was needed, I think I would do that today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=808.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what I see in place is so impressive in the fact that we have people that were committed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=816.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that reached out to probably one of the greatest support teams with the Collins Center and someone who I respect in the world of municipalities, former alderman in Melrose and former city solicitor Frank Wright and listening and answering, listening to how he's answering the questions and his team and I think that this is a great<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=838.65s">[Scarpelli]</a>: great situation right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=840.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I love what we have, what we've crafted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=843.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have some reservations as well, but I know my colleagues have shared some, and I think that the biggest takeaway from this is I'm a huge advocate now for 11 councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=856.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm a huge advocate for ward representation for all eight wards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=862.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You realize as I talk to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=864.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as I talk to people, even in the city of Medford, and we talk about getting people involved in the election process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=870.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as I sit with marginalized people and they say, George, you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=873.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's easy for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=875.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have a base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=876.571s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you run at large, it's easy for you to raise $20,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=879.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's easy for you to say you represent everybody, because I think I've done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=884.636s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wouldn't ever take away that I represented everybody in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=889.079s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if I ever ran, if it was the time that I ran, I probably would run at large just for the fact that I enjoy<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=894.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the whole community, that whole battle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=897.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But talking to my fellow colleagues in neighboring communities, you understand how important it is for mostly marginalized people that have been underrepresented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=906.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And right now there's a battle going on in another room talking about zoning reform at Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=913.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as a person who grew up off of Salem Street, my former neighbors have called me and said, George, why wouldn't you want ward representation with every ward considering<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=924.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Shame on you, because we didn't hear from you at Salem Street when it came to the ward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=928.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We felt like we weren't listened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=930.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is why now it's a battle with the Salem Street zoning situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=935.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're seeing that in pockets all over the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=938.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're seeing at Tufts University with the 10-story building, how it's affecting that community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=942.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I've talked to friends and neighbors there at St.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=944.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: George.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=944.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Here we go again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=945.747s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The charter review is important because if we had a representative that we can go into in our own backyard that we see every day at the coffee shop,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=953.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: then it wouldn't, the information wouldn't have been getting out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=956.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one of the biggest things I've had, the negative pieces I've had is a lack of information that's going out to the community because the lack of a written newspaper, the lack of true communication across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=968.293s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one piece that I found that made me feel secure in my process as I go forward with this is the thought process saying, you know what, we might not have a newspaper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=979.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but everybody in every small pocket of our community now will have someone that they feel like they can call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=985.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so there are so many things I've learned, and like, again, I'm a big boy now, and I've learned a lot, good and bad, and I wish I could turn back the clock on some of the decisions I made, but when I see the information that's in front of us,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1003.417s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm really excited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1004.539s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm really excited and I commend all of you for all the hard work that you've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1008.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, if you've ever felt that I was an enemy to the cause,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1018.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think I was educated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1020.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't educate myself to the cost because I was stubborn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1022.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what I see in front of me right now, I can't wait to get this through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1027.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can't wait to get this to the legislature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1029.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can't wait to come back so we can get this on the ballot and see all these great changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1034.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think we see a lot of things that aren't working in Medford and the divide in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1040.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A lot of it's because we haven't done this, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1046.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you're seeing how important word representation is across the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1050.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's time to, like I said to, my wife and I were talking, I said, Jesus, Dina, she says, it's time for me to grow up and put my big boy pants on and say, hey, listen, this is a great proposal and let's do everything we can to move it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1064.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I commend your charter review team and our friends from the Collins Center, they've done so much work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1074.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: are the actual experts in this field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1078.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think guided this platform to a very robust discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1084.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, so I could talk a buzzard off a meat wagon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1088.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1089.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1494.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1494.824s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1495.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that as I went through my notes, I did have a note.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1500.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And correct me if we'll go back to this again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1502.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was a little preoccupied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1506.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we started looking into composition of terms of office and eligibility, I wanted to ask the Collins Center, I think that one of the constituents, people that have read this and called and asked opinions, with the mayor's four-year term, and the council too, and school committee too, the question they brought up, I said, well, let me ask if it's common,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1534.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you see that two years really sometimes prohibits true government because you see that it's so short that you're finding that you're always politicking instead of doing what's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1546.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the question is, has that been entertained?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1548.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have you seen other communities do a three-year term where it's a two-year for school committee, three-year term for the council, and then four-year term for the mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1558.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's just something that was asked of me, and I just wanted to get your opinion on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1609.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's great input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1611.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1613.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see what they mean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1614.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand what the two-year term is difficult, because it seems like you really, once you get going,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1623.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as an elected official, then all of a sudden you have people that you've promised so much to and they've come to you and said, now it feels like you truly are looking at times at the greater picture of an elected official.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1637.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what's the greater good of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1638.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate the input and that's something I'll share with them if they're not watching tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1642.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2557.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2559.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2561.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Before I move on, if anybody wants any information about my glasses, it's a new, very expensive company that I can share with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2573.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's called Broke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2575.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's called Half Glass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2576.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's called Broke Cheats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2578.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I apologize for that, because I know my wife's watching right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2582.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I come home tonight, she's going to smash me with one of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2585.362s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the 15 pairs I have at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2586.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the question I had was, I know that as we talked about this, I had a question that a resident asked, and I know it's by ordinance, but when we have boards and commissions, have you ever seen a charter, a part of the charter be put in more, anything that would recommend the concerns of residency requirements for different boards and commissions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2611.47s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that something that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2613.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we would put in our charter or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2617.236s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2617.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I, if I could, that'd be something that I don't see it in front of me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2622.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that where we can fit that, I think that that's been a concern where we've had commissions or boards of commissions in the city that residents might've been living here and we can understand if they moved out that they finished the term, but we're seeing a lot of people that, that we see people that have been on boards of commissions that don't even live in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2643.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that, you know, finding that language and seeing if that's something we should visit, if that, we could see anything pertaining to that would be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2653.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2664.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, just make a motion to request friends from the Collins Senate to see if they can draft any,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2673.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: information that might be prudent for us to look at and maybe vote on for the possibility of resident requirements for boards and commissions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3087.692s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you and appreciate constantly has bringing us forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3089.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that, um and the spirit of what I've seen with this administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3094.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think having that majority vote in my opinion is isn't robust enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3100.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3108.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: some authority and more openness and transparency when it comes to positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3114.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that one of the biggest things we've seen over the last couple of years is that the positions that are created that this council doesn't even vote for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3122.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's happened multiple times, not just with this council, but previous councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3130.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think lessening that and giving the mayor's office more of autonomy to make these decisions<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3138.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: without a more weighted process that really makes it accountable for the position that she's presenting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3155.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think I would rather see the two-thirds vote for the fact that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3162.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That meat is needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3209.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just wanted to note that we... I'm reading the red line as I'm reading the original, so... Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3214.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3216.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I withdraw.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3216.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3738.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, I think that with the professionals from the Collins Center, 40% sounds like a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3747.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What would you recommend?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3749.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What have you seen that really works and where that middle ground where the, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3756.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: extra one-on-one elections that might cost the city money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3784.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3788.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3788.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's my fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3791.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're seeing what's coming out in local elections recently in Medford, you know, with 60,000 residents and 40,000, 35,000, 40,000 voters and only 13,000, 14,000, 15,000 coming out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3798.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that would pose a problem for the process, you know, going any higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5509.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5511.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As I, like I said, I really focused on really looking into this process because it was one of the pieces that really limited me from moving forward with the chattel review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5525.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now as we're seeing the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5530.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The body that has worked on this, the professionals that have worked on this, and the committee that's gone out to the city and the community and worked diligently with the community have drafted a proposal that I think is what the community is asking for, the residents are asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5547.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think I mentioned the key pieces that I think understanding the representation for all of our wards is so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5557.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think when we talked about the ability for someone that's marginalized that might not have the opportunity to run at large.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5571.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: having a better chance running an award, even running in the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5574.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So having a better representation, maybe seeing a council that looks a little different than we see today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5580.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's what I've heard from council, from community members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5583.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that when we look at this and I looked across the state, I believe there's only three out of the whole state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5590.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe there's only three, correct me if I'm wrong, but there's only three that have a seven body council when you look at this format.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5599.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think what you see is a council of ward representation and at-large members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5605.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's a huge involvement and openness and form of transparency, communication, and reachability to every corner of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5621.922s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think what the Charter Review Committee has put forth with the 11 members, I think it's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5629.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that that's something that I think the, tell me if I'm wrong, but the majority of the community has said to me, and this is why I know so much about it, because I was against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5639.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was against ward representation completely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5641.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now when you sit and talk and the understanding of every single ward, imagine telling one ward they're not represented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5647.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, but no, no, the district, but it's not the ward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5651.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is what we're seeing right now because we're the divide in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5655.953s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We do have a huge divide in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5657.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one of those divides is people feeling that they don't, they're not listened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5662.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're not, they don't have anybody that they feel they can go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5666.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And especially when you see the demographic method now, we have a lot of new method residents coming in that have grown up in communities that have ward representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5673.745s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that comfort level is gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5674.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they've eliminated themselves of being part of that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5678.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we're seeing so many pieces that this fits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5685.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And changing what is put forth I think would be a frightening thought because here's the piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5693.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We saw with the override question that this community was divided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5699.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're seeing right now, what I'm hearing from both sides saying that this is something they like, it fits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5706.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's something that you meet, you can really go and I think this would be something that they could support and move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5711.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will tell you the comments that I've heard from residents saying if we go to seven, doesn't that sound like and against conspiracy theory but unfortunately this community runs on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5722.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Doesn't this sound like it's just an organization wanting to keep the numbers down so they can control this council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5728.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm not saying that it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5729.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm saying that this is the perception that goes out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5733.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is where, when it comes down to a vote of charter change, charter review, and a vote, this is where we won't get the support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5740.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, again, I say this publicly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5743.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't believe in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5744.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But these are the questions that have been brought up that said, when we go to the vote,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5748.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: let's give the city what they've been asking for, what the professionals have brought forward, what the committee that has worked so hard to go to every corner of the city and draft this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5761.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that that's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5764.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we look at the different compensation piece, I know we've held that off and we're gonna revisit that again, but I've listened to some community members that had said, you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5777.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're in fiscal crisis, we're having financial difficulties in Medford, even with 11 people, how would you correct it and say, well, you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5783.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: By moving toward representation, your schedule isn't as busy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5789.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not reaching out to every corner of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5792.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So maybe the compensation could be lowered because it would be less work in theory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5798.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I mean, there's so many pieces that you look at this and say, well, this is, it fits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5804.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because ultimately what we want is we want this community to vote for it and support it and move forward to change what we need in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5811.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is just a piece that I think is very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5814.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, we've said it a thousand times, and every member here, I've heard it and I've seen it on the campaign trail, that really having a representation of a more diverse council, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5828.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What could support a more diverse council but getting people that are marginalized, giving them the opportunity<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5834.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to really control the opportunity to win a seat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5841.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not a bigger district, not a bigger community at large, but looking at a ward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5846.512s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's achievable for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5849.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know I joked with Councilor Beaz earlier, but we're hearing it, you know, you wouldn't really have in our revolutions text Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5861.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I did get an email that they asked if I can read it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5863.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is something that our revolution members put forth that many people voted for them because of this and that's what was said was our revolution metric advocates for transitions methods current at large electoral system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5879.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to award-based representation model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5881.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This change aims to ensure that each neighborhood has direct representation and the city government promoting equitable participation and addressing the unique needs of diverse communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5891.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And their 2023-24 method people platform, ORM, our revolution method, emphasizes the importance of the city charter reform to implement ward representation, therefore enhancing the inclusivity,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5908.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: inclusivity and responsiveness of local governance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5912.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I remind my colleagues that this is what you ran on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5915.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is your platform that you ran on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5917.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to come in today, this is what leaves the city divided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5922.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what then comes in and says, you know what, then I know this committee did great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5926.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We want to see some change, but you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5929.311s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It seems disingenuous, to be honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5931.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they sit back and say, what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5932.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not gonna vote for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5933.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm gonna tell my families that are saying, well, instead of voting for the change of charter, why jeopardize this with something that works?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5941.099s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And maybe the call in Senate can prove me wrong, but there's a reason why we do 11, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5947.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's eight members, every ward is represented, and then the three at large.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5952.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And correct me if I'm wrong, the majority, if not,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5957.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: most of the state that has the ward representation has this form, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5966.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, like I said, I thought there's only three that have such a limited district process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5974.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and again, I urge my colleagues to follow the advice of the professionals, follow the advice of the people that have been in the streets in Medford, not nationally,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5986.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: not different parts of the country, but in Medford, what they've done for their work to reach every corner of Medford that came out and said, let's do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5996.922s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that I feel strongly about, and I think that we should support this and leave it as it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6001.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President, I mean, Mr. Chairperson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7051.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7334.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7335.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I look at this presentation as something very important for the goal of this initiative being strong enough that the voters will pass and support what we bring forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7354.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we've done is we've had the opportunity for a group of people to go out and get the information from the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7362.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then we brought in the professionals from the Collins Center to support and guide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7369.509s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is what's come out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7372.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've heard some of my colleagues look at this, and I've got to be very honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7377.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We say it's not political, but I hear a lot of double talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7381.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm actually sitting back shocked that I'm saying, I can't believe that I'm saying what I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7386.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm hearing this from the people on your own platform<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7390.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that you've said, quote unquote, like directly, that the importance of a city charter reform is implementing award representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7404.035s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm just confused because it seems like a lot of you are backpedaling for the platform that you were elected to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7410.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And at the same time, when it fit that dialogue, you've also said, well, these are the people that I knocked on their doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7418.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And those people, I have to support them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7421.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I have to push that agenda through, even though sometimes it's not best for the whole community, but these are the people that helped you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7427.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've said it and elected you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7429.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, maybe you could say it's not true, but I'll say it over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7432.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The power of video is amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7437.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are things you've said and done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7438.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't pull this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7439.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had a member of the revolution send this to me who didn't want to jeopardize their name or their friendship with some of you that said that they're very difficult to see this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7450.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have some counsel saying that the difficult about this is really running the meeting and being organized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7458.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, that's not the charter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7460.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's our city council rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7463.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's our policies we can change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7464.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll tell you one, and I can go to the meeting video as well, that when the council voted five to two to eliminate meetings every Tuesday night, and Councilor Caraviello and myself voted against it, the councilor that's here tonight mentioned that if we see it's not working, then we'll go back to the every Tuesday meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7483.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I hear that as a problem, because the meetings are running longer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7487.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it seems like the message is being muddied, or it's taking too long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7493.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, that's a city council rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7495.661s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not a charter rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7498.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've heard a councilor tonight talk about, well, imagine this, some of the wards are too small, so they don't need representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7507.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Wow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7509.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, a fellow councilor said that there are some of the wards, we could play it back, but some of the wards are so small,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7516.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we maybe might not need ward representation in such small wards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7521.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wrote it by word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7524.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then you hear, we're looking from the improvement, it's better than what we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7531.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm hearing council say it's better what we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7533.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that what we're here to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7534.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just to get better or fix what's been wrong here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7539.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, this is coming from a place where I was against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7544.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now I feel like I'm standing on an island saying, am I hearing myself?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7550.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've been praising Mrs. McDonald and her group and how hard they've been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7554.821s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they've gone, they went out and talked to Medford residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7558.223s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They want to see Medford results.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7560.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They want to see this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7562.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The professionals at Collins Center said, this is what works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7565.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we have Councilors bringing up numbers from Wyoming and California showing us numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7573.233s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who cares?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7574.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know their breakdown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7577.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm worried about Medford, Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7579.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And from what I gather, there are only three communities in the state of Massachusetts with this form of government that only look at district representation or such a small representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7592.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then the biggest piece that we've said over and over again, and it sounds like because it doesn't fit the narrative, we're avoiding it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7600.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This will give us a more diverse community council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7604.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Of course it will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7606.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, we have a slow turnout.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7608.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, imagine if we have an award representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7613.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have we seen, maybe the Collins Center can help us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7616.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you see organizations go from at large to award representations, I'm assuming that voter turnout will be larger because now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7627.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you have people that are identifying certain groups and certain people that will then run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7632.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With the ward representation being that you don't have to encompass yourself throughout the whole community, time-wise, or raise enough money to run at large, we're giving our, or even a district, we're giving our residents an opportunity to be part of this great option and be a voice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7650.913s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know it sounds critical and maybe I'm attacking, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7655.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't anything that my fellow councils haven't said in meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7660.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here I am coming back and saying, am I in a bizarro world?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7665.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll say this again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7667.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're trying to pass a piece of legislation here that will go out that the city is gonna vote on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7677.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that's popular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7680.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that everybody I talked to on both sides, it didn't matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7686.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They appreciate the ward representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7687.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They appreciate that all eight wards will be represented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7692.47s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's something they can go to the election booth in November and vote in support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7700.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why would we now finally get to the finish line and try to honestly look like you're trying to control it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7708.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because that's what it sounds like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7709.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Look, this is what it sounds like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7711.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It sounds like you want seven people so you can control it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7714.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because when you open it to 11 people, maybe you don't, you lose the majority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7721.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's the disrespect that happens time and time with this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7725.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Listen, there are things that I don't, I don't like my fellow council say, but I would never disrespect and openly laugh like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7732.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7733.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what we have at this council day after evening after evening when, when my fellow council is the chair of this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7739.698s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7740.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't anything that I made up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7743.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just explained what my fellow Councilors just said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7748.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just reiterated what my fellow Councilors have said in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7751.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just read a passage from the people's platform of our revolution that this council all ran on a slate, that they preached and ran on ward representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7761.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't make this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7764.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know you're angry because it doesn't fit what you just presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7771.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and it might not go your way, but let's look at the big picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7776.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We want this passed now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7779.575s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as one council that understands, and you look at the full picture now and do your homework and understand it and really not be angry at what I've lived through and say, have an open mind and look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7793.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I've had that open mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7794.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's allowed me to talk to a lot of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7797.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the eight wards being represented with the three out loud members is something that I would support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7805.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's something that the professionals from the call center support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7809.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's what the people that have gone meeting after meeting throughout the whole community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7815.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know because they've called me a thousand times getting input from neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7824.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we talk about let the people speak, I think the people, it was clear, it's right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7830.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now this is being put forth by a Councilor for truly, I'll be honest with you, I don't see the weight in your presentation of why seven or district representation has been more beneficial than a true ward representation of all of our whole community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8905.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Chair, to my colleague that referenced the Council that got up and walked out while she was speaking, I want to apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8913.187s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been sick, so I ran out of water and I felt a little faint, so I had to go get water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8920.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I apologize if I disrespected any member of the council to get water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8924.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I apologize for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8927.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For my colleagues that seem to be offended that I'm bringing politics into politics, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8935.514s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I don't align with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8939.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You are a slate of six that vote in tow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8943.456s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You usually vote in tow, but you all vote together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8946.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: on your agendas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8948.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's known.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8949.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's nothing that's a secret.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8950.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm trying to attack anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8953.02s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But my position as a city councilor is to be the voice that people call or express a concern or the way they feel or they want to be represented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8964.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when I bring a topic forward, if it hurts your feelings, I'll do respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8969.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8971.794s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My goal is to make sure that everybody's view is represented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8978.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know my council colleagues are upset or feel hurt or the reason that I disrespected them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8987.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm just sharing what has been brought to my attention by constituents that I'm expressing it night after night, because it seems like I'm the only one because some people just aren't listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9000.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is why our community is in flux right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9003.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we look at this situation right now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9006.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: where we are right now, the council brought up some changes and supported it, some with facts, some with his own beliefs, his belief system, which I respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9020.233s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's his belief system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9022.574s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's his due diligence looking forward in his decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9025.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Myself, I looked at it totally opposite, but I will not, I will not apologize to share<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9036.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what has been asked of me by constituents, maybe constituents that don't even vote for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9044.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my personal opinion and my motion is we stay with the original presentation by the Charter Review Committee with the 11 representatives, eight board, three at large, and again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9064.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we can look back at this tape and listen to what everybody has said and what I expressed from what they said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9071.93s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't made up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9074.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't a dialogue to make this like some kind of a clown show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9080.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is an expression of one council's view in comparison to six others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9087.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I will not apologize for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9090.756s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And unfortunately, my friends,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9093.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is politics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9095.794s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't, hey, kumbaya, let's all sit together and say, let's all do this, let's run together and let's have one vision and make Medford what we believe in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9104.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, because that's not how it works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9105.681s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a very different complex world we live in in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9110.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the thing that people come back for over and over again is they feel that this council isn't listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9118.651s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And all I'm saying is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9120.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a committee that's worked their tails off months after months, night after night, getting the information that presented to the professionals and that presented to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9133.949s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And all I'm saying is the belief of a council making a change and my beliefs from what I've heard from constituents or my personal belief and understanding is that the ward representation of all eight wards are represented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9153.297s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and to throw in pieces like, well, you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9156.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They'll be there forever, or not enough people will come out in that ward, 2,500 people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9164.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the way of the world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9165.963s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is how we work through things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9168.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To say that we won't have enough people, not enough people come out and vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9171.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, maybe these are the changes that will bring our constituents out to vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9174.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Make them feel like they're part of the solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9177.247s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have them feel vested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9179.168s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Make them feel part of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9185.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, thank you for allowing me to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=15408.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I urge this council to listen to the comments from the Collins Center that delaying this because Councilor Callahan and Councilor Leming haven't been heard, I think they've been heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=15421.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, they were here, they were part of the discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=15425.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not like they haven't been here, they weren't here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=15428.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To now move this to another meeting and then to a meeting to vote, let's make a decision, let's move forward so we're not stalling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=15440.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This has to go to a vote, to the legislation, this has to go to the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=15444.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just think that we keep kicking this can down the road and we're gonna be exactly where we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=15449.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I think we entrusted<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=15456.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a group of citizens to do the work for this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=15461.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that it's been loud and clear what they've shared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=15467.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I would be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=15469.907s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would disagree with what motions of forward and put forth my motion to move forward with this vote with the ward representation of eight and then the three at large.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=15482.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And let's get this process moving so we can move method forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=15485.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1809.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, President Villes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1811.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, I know that, um, when you look at the financial impacts to resurface, um, um, place that I know that our high school team uses that, uh, those courts and if<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1828.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: those courts are not playable like in my profession where we've lost our courts for our high school team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1836.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We then have to bus our high school teams off site to support their practices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1844.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that I know the high school uses it during the spring season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1849.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that Kevin does use it a lot with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1853.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with outside groups or with recreation groups that bring in funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1858.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think it's important that, especially as we're seeing pickleball grow, keeping tennis-only courts, especially when you're looking for a facility that is what placed it is, having, I believe, four courts, three or four courts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1877.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, the programming to be dedicated to tennis and it doesn't, it's not interrupted like what you see at over at Duggar Park, which is a huge benefit, but it also has to, has to be shared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1891.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's a huge piece to take in consideration, the money that's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1899.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that's saved in the trickle down effect back to our budget when it comes down time to vote every little penny counts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1906.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that that's a huge benefit for our high school athletic program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1912.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2049.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2051.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm so happy to see this on the agenda that we're going to entertain this because I think that safety is the biggest concern, especially what we're seeing for activities at the Shell, not just for shows or entertainment, but for our farmers market and the ability to light that area, I think is so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2073.65s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think when you look at that, the other piece that you see is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2078.453s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a recreation employee, as soon as we went to to Moscow lighting, we realized the cost savings that directly came back to our city and our department because of the fact that with the old system of lighting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2098.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 1, it was archaic and to the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2103.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: understanding of someone sending somebody down to flick a switch and then come back later to flick the switch again would cost you four hours in overtime and that adds up believe it or not so musco lighting has been a godsend to municipalities so i think that it really saves<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2124.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when you look at finances and a hidden cost that really pays off at the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2130.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm glad to see this and I would support it as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2133.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2466.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I apologize, Mr. President, it's left up, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2677.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, I'm sorry, my hand was up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2679.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2682.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: no i apologize i put it up and down so many times i just wanted to make sure that miss dupont just uh just share with the public i know that we've had some questions in the past and i had an email today just that people were questioning whether um how does this fit as if it's not a city facility this is something that i support as a historical building in our community and trying to enhance that and make sure we we provide assistance any way we can to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2711.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to make sure the Shallow Baptist and I believe the Unitarian Church as well that people understand that there are criteria that we follow that but legally we can use our CPA funds to assist in projects like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2731.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the question that I had today was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2735.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they weren't against any of these uh the the churches personally but the question was if the tax money is uh is it going to a city owned facility that's what they were confused in so i know that i know if miss dupont can expand expand on that a little bit i know that there are some legalities that show that it absolutely fits into this um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2758.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this criteria and we're not violating any legal issues, but I just wanted to make sure we had clarification on that because I want to make sure that there's no negativity behind any of these projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2772.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think they're all worthwhile and in my mind fit the scope of historical and I would support it a thousand percent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2781.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But just for that fact,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2783.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if we can share any information that would help clear some questions some residents that have asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2790.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2905.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2906.716s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that there really weren't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2907.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It wasn't about just the facility that it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2910.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was a church.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2911.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was that focus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2912.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The question was that if it's not a city facility, but I appreciate that answer being that defining that a community exactly what the title title is about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2922.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for clarifying that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2924.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I hope that residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2927.518s">[Scarpelli]</a>: feel that that's adequate because I think it sure fits the purpose that I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2935.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3726.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2179.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2181.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, my question was from the beginning of the presentation, but Paul, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2186.666s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, you could see the hard work in the presentation, and there is a lot of excitement with some of these opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2195.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that I'd be remiss to say that, you know, we're seeing some we're seeing the impacts of, um, the lack of communication again to really get the word out to the neighborhoods and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2209.681s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, I know that in the last few weeks we've done, we've tried to do the best we can and we're doing more than we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2216.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think we were seeing it now with so many questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2221.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as we're getting to the end of the Salem Street district and the neighborhoods rallying<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2228.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: um, and really not feeling like they've been part of the part of the process or have been given the questions answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2237.756s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, and there's a lot of fear and a lot of questions going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2241.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, as tonight started, I received a few emails from, um, residents from Lawrence Estates, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2251.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: letting me know that they just found out that there's some sort of a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2255.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, and I think we I know that I've shown you the date from when the last council really focused on implementing a more robust process and communications and bringing these meetings to the neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2272.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know it's not it wasn't written in the R. F. P. I know Councilor President Bears informed us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2278.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2280.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we move forward, we really need to find a better way, even if it's a reverse 911, letting the neighborhoods know that these meetings are happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2292.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I know we've had up to almost 20 meetings now discussing this process, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2300.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I implore all of us to understand that there is groundswell starting in a negative undertone when it doesn't have to be for the fact that even the Salem Street situation, a lot of these, the questions that the fair, a lot of them could be answered in the meeting with the simple sentence or two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2320.824s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2322.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think again, uh, if we when we move forward, I see our schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2327.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The schedule looks great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2328.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're at the beginning phases of this process, this new process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2333.539s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, um, I just don't want to be in the same place we are with the Salem Street<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2337.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh quarter and what we're hearing now and the displeasure and the the anger and the discourse and this divide now and it's it's it's something that I think we need to find a way that this council this uh city administration needs to really we we have so many avenues a communications director we have um we have different avenues that we can tap into I mean it's we really need to find a way if we can to please<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2368.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: set the schedule, alert people when we're going to be talking about their neighborhoods so they can be present or at least to be told that we've done A, B and C. I just don't think people have heard us and they truly don't know the impacts that are being created in their neighborhoods until it's time to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2394.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to the end product, which we're seeing Salem Street getting really close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2398.717s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, um, and I'm sure everybody there is heard the negative undertone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2404.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I hate to be the Debbie Downer every time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2408.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, you come to come to us for for meeting because of all the hard work you've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2414.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I just had to share that with you as we move forward with this next process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2418.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2419.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Vice President, for allowing me to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2495.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=486.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know one of the key pieces I was asking for is the mayor's plan for capital plans and projects that are slated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=494.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that from what I hear and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=497.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: from the state, Metro wasn't on the list of 10 so far for the MSBA for the new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=508.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it'd be interesting to see before we vote on such a large money order and understanding what the MSBA has already shared and what's coming down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=520.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that's not pressing, but again, I requested a report<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=525.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I haven't seen anything, if you can enlighten me, but I haven't seen anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=543.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about adding this project, the scope of this project, in front of this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=551.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's important that we know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=554.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what's ahead of us and how we're planning on funding all of these projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=559.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's a little disheartening as well, Mr. President, I know that we talked last week and when I conferred with an attorney, it's nothing illegal to ask for a financial breakdown of the process with the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=575.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's a little disingenuine when you come here in front of this council and it's a $5 million, but when you ask for a simple question,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=583.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for a breakdown of financial matters that happen in the school department and we hear nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=589.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So those are the two big things that I'm a little curious about before we move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=593.563s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I move on to thinking about influence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=594.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=1995.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=1997.487s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much for the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=1999.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is very thorough, and I think that this is something that's needed, no doubt about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2004.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, the so-called new schools, I was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2007.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: on what was called the 18 when we first started in elementary school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2012.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I must have slipped in by accident as a teacher back in the day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2016.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it was definitely needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2019.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know I've talked to a lot of parents and teachers, former colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2024.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's very important, but for one Councilor, like I said, I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2029.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: my apprehension is really and the structure of the way that our administration is informing us and where we are, at least this one Councilor, where we are financially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2037.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, if I, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2039.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Cushing, forgive me if I'm wrong, but this first five million, this is something that we'll be bonding as well, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2047.16s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2047.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2048.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then the bigger number is the one that comes later and obviously it's going to follow if we approve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2053.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's something I totally want to support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2056.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But unfortunately,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2058.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not getting the information back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2059.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not gonna halt it by rule 21 or section 22 of this project tonight, because I hear what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2066.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think there is a timeline, but I think to the president and to the mayor to understand as we move forward with these bigger projects, I think having more robust discussion of what our financial outlook is in the whole community and what's coming down the line, which I think is very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2084.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's something that I will be using.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2087.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I won't hold this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2089.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know how the timeline is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2091.311s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not going to hold it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2092.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can't support it because it's against what I feel is my position here as a city councilor, and that is being the steward of our finances and understanding what the big picture is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2104.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it could be something very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2105.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's just that I haven't had any communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2107.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've asked that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2108.209s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know you were here last meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2109.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's something I asked for from the administration that we, part of this meeting, we talk about what the implications are as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2116.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We look at different projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2118.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like I know that the override was failed with the fire station, but there are still needs there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2125.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're also talking about what's happening for the new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2128.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's something that I wanna support a thousand percent, but we still don't know what the impact will be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2134.663s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we try to, you know, reach out and try to either bond or ask for an override in or debt exclusion for that project so there are so many pieces you know we're also talking about so many new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2147.739s">[Scarpelli]</a>: zoning implications that are hitting us pretty soon and and wanted to see what what kind of growth the city will use these new zoning rules and how that can grow help us grow so there's so much involved and I think that uh again for one council who understands and wants to support this because of the need and I won't I won't hold it back but that's the reason why I can't I can't support it fundamentally I can't I have a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2175.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For some odd reason, the communication with this councilor and the city administration is zero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2180.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think something simple as asking for a breakdown of the superintendent's buyout, which is not fraudulent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2186.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not saying anything that was illegal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2188.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not saying it was wrong or bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2190.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what it's called in the terms when you settle on a mutual buyout and just asking for that financial implication so we can understand the process and getting answers back saying that it's a school committee purview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2204.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know that's wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2205.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I spoke to my attorney that will speak to me that is very well versed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2211.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is, it's a basic request from a city councilor, especially when it's funding that's ultimately signed off by, for one of the votes by this councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2222.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I hope you understand why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2224.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I appreciate the thorough breakdown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2228.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is obviously something you've<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2230.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: done so so much work on and it's great to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2233.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sure we have plans for moving all the summer programs because they know how important they are out of those two buildings and I know that's going to be daunting so but I also I love the fact that we're already planning for that so these are a lot of great you hear a lot of great things and I appreciate the hard work that you've done so and thank you for hearing me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2657.351s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=976.52s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=977.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President for allowing me the opportunity to speak on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=983.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh, true legend here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=985.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, when we know that Mr. Granada has been fighting a good fight for some time now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=990.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, but when, uh, we sure when God came calling this past week, um, we knew he now has one of the best people Medford ever had to offer to sit by his side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1004.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, Mr. Granada was so entrenched in our community and had so much love and passion for the city that I remember the time when I first started<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1012.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the option of running for school committee, I had to go sit with Mr. Granara to get his blessing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1021.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not for the fact that he was the God, but it was so important to get his blessing so he can talk to you and explain to you what it truly meant to be an elected official in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1035.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He made me understand that the reason why we become elected officials<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1039.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is the work that you are doing for the community, for the residents of the city, not for yourself, not for yourself, anything to gain any self-worth or for you personally, but what's best for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1053.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that when you first hear some of the things, I know that people don't know this, but Mr. Granara was a major factor in the Middlesex Sheriff's Offices and Trevor Katushin<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1065.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: wrote this past week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1066.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It is with a heavy heart that I must inform you all the former Special Sheriff John Granara Esquire has passed away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1074.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our thoughts and prayers are with his entire Granara family during this difficult time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1077.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A graduate of Matanon High School, Boston College, Suffolk University Law School, John Granara served the MSO with distinction in the highest levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1086.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He began as the MSO's Chief Legal Counsel in March 1997, serving until 2009 of August.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1093.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when he was appointed as Special Sheriff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1096.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Following the passing of the Sheriff Jimmy DePaulo in November of 2010, Special Sheriff Granara ably ran this agency until the appointment of Sheriff Katushin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1107.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Providing leadership at the pivotal time for the Middlesex Sheriff's Office, he was an invaluable source of knowledge, leadership, and friendship to me and many others throughout his tenure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1117.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was our great privilege to have him remain as a Special Sheriff until August of 2011.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1122.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: John's legacy is public service included his time in the method school committee from 74 to 77 and his election to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 76 representing his beloved hometown of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1136.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In his memory, the half the flags in Middlesex jails were all lowered to half staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1142.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, I know I read council bears read a few things that Mr. Granada did, but he did every<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1148.223s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He did more than people even knew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1149.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was a lot of things, whether it's a celebration parade in Medford, whether it's supporting different programs that no one knew about, it was Mr. Granauer that did the work behind the scenes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1162.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he kept a tradition that I thought was so valuable and so needed for our veterans that I believe it was, I said Memorial Day, but I believe it's Memorial Day, not Veterans Day, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1175.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that working together with the members of the American Legion and the Elks, they would have our presentation and he would set a day of remembrance that you had to be there, you couldn't miss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1192.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So he was a special individual and someone that this city will miss, but if you've known John Granara, please share a story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1201.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Don't let his,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1204.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: his work fade away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1207.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let that name stick with you, because this is what the city is lacking today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1212.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The reason why you see such divide is because people like John Granara aren't here to bring these groups together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1218.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to the Granara family, we send our deepest condolences, and I'd love to, if we can, leave this meeting in his honor, Mr. President, and thank you for the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1269.34s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1270.761s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Another long time battle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1274.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Evangelista fought hard to be there for his loving wife and his two daughters, like he's always been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1281.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And unfortunately,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1283.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was taken from us and hopefully is resting in peace now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1289.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the Evangelista family worked so hard, especially Julianne and Lisa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1294.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We all know Lisa, who's worked for the city for many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1298.456s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to say she ran the city while Mike McGlynn was the mayor for those many, many years, and then moved over to the school department for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1308.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and I know that he will be missed and we just share our condolences with Evangelista family, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1330.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I found them in the ordering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2299.794s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2301.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for this initiative I so excited to see this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2304.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I can't wait for the involvement of our parents and, and, and really pick your brain and then as a program developer for parks and recreation department, and a neighboring community that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2316.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is focusing on the enhancement and the growth of our adaptive programming for after school, before school, and during the summers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2325.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that during the vacation weeks, I'm so excited that, you know, that we have a group of parents that can kickstart something here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2333.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know I've worked very closely with Kevin and also the directors in Belmont and also in Malden because we find it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2340.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: very difficult to get programs that were bringing enough enough participants to make it sustainable in the sense not that it's, you know, we've offered to do special programming with, you know, with as free programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2355.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've looked into providing free transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2359.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're really excited and looking into trying to do things collaboratively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2362.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why I'm so excited tonight to see this, that our parents can share some information that I would love to work with Kevin directly with Somerville and saying, hey, this is a great collaboration where there'll be no boundaries, there'll be no limitations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2378.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I remember we worked closely with, at one time, the only thing that was offered for our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2383.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: special needs and adaptive families back in the day when I first started as a developer was the top soccer program and it was such an important program and I remember talking to parents as we ran that program through and it was so important for the parents to feel that they want to be soccer moms and dads as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2403.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was just important for the whole family to have these programs and I'm so excited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2407.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've worked with Adaptive Sports New England in trying to bring programs to Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2414.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One program we're looking to start this coming year is looking to use Dillboy Stadium for our wheelchair accessible track program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2425.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One thing that I'm working closely with the Special Needs Department and Somerville in trying to find a true partnership that we can really sustain it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2433.159s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that when we've had a program during the summer, and it's an adaptive parks and recreation program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2441.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we would offer that after our students would leave the summer program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2446.209s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it was very accessible, and we made sure we supported in every which way with transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2454.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we found it at times that the numbers weren't there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2457.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that really having a group that can advocate that we can turn to both Kevin and I personally, because I think it'll be a huge success if we collaborate and work together with neighboring communities so we can really help it grow it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2472.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm excited for the fact I've given, I've been given that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2476.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that permission from our director in Somerville, that we can really enhance our, our adaptive programming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2484.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so I, again, I could talk a buzz it off me wagon because I'm really excited about this, but I'd love to hear what our parents have to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2491.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, and if there's a way that we can meet after to try to set something up together, that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2496.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2498.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hey, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3649.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3649.698s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm so passionate about this because what we're seeing, what I see in a day-to-day situation in my profession<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3658.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hear it from our parents today and what we're hearing is the the difficult of having something in your own town and I know it's difficult I'd love to do more in the town that I work in the city working but it's sometimes you don't get the numbers that you need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3675.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's why the conversation with Director Levine in Malden and Director Bailey here in Medford, we've been talking about trying to find a collaboration between the triangle, the three of us, and trying to find a way to pool all the assets that we have together so we can have something that parents don't have to drive to Watertown or Burlington or Brookline<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3698.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but they stay right in this room and we can offer something and that that's that's something that our kids and families would love.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3708.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we have someone here right now that i'll come to the carpet we we've been very fortunate to have the teamsters as part of our family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3716.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll be honest with you, whenever I need anything, I would go to the Teamsters organization who works so hard for artistic community, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3723.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they run the artistic gala to help us support programs and they've always done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3728.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So Steve, I'll be calling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3730.575s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that looking as a collaboration, maybe having Mayor Lungo-Koehn and working with Mayor Christensen and working with Mayor Ballantyne and saying, hey, maybe there's somewhere we can go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3742.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It wouldn't be great, something like the Heckner Center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3745.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: having a central site for our adaptive programming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3750.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Park right next door that's enclosed and safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3754.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, we can even across the street, we have St.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3757.268s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Francis has a gymnasium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3759.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3761.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have great people that have worked with our most vulnerable for many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3765.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Ron Giovino has done an amazing job with the Challenger program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3769.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And imagine using that to enhance that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3771.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we have an adaptive physical education teacher at Method High School, and Kala Andre, and she's doing amazing things with the Challenger program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3780.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And imagine bringing that to an after school program, bringing that in a Saturday program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3786.115s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think there's so much we can do as a city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3790.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the avenues that we already have and the partners that we already have, I don't think this is a reach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3796.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that what you hear, everybody loves to hear inclusionary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3799.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, we're inclusionary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3801.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I was fortunate enough to start the summer program at the former Columbus, now the Mr. Tuck School, one of the issues is making sure that our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3813.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: special needs community had an avenue for a summer program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3817.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we really, at the time, Superintendent Belson made it a priority that it was open for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3825.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I also understand that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3828.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: all inclusionary sometimes in some communities mean that all you're doing is saying we're covering you, but really not doing anything for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3836.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm excited just from what I hear and maybe if I could be added to any of the future meetings and maybe bring in Kevin Bailey, we can reach out to Joe Levine over in Malden and see if there's a true collaboration that we can use that, you know, maybe we're doing the basketball program here<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3856.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: at the recreation center, but maybe we're doing our soccer program over at Dillboy Stadium, or maybe we're doing our track program over at McDonald Stadium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3867.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's not that far of a drive, but it's sustainable enough that we can bring families together and have a true program that we can really be proud of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3878.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I find it so difficult to try to run the program in Somerville because it's our number one initiative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3884.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we just not getting the numbers because we have, we have, we have hundreds of parents have hundreds of kids but unfortunately, some can only do some after school here, some can don't have transportation there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3896.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Some don't have this will maybe if there's a vibrant program that we have multiple offerings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3903.16s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that maybe we can do something great and I'm excited about moving forward and helping this community and I and I, you know, Medford high did something that's very different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3914.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Most communities don't have an adaptive physical education teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3919.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What they do is is a physical education teacher who studied the adaptive program<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3925.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you can cover some because of your experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3928.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But Medford has a teacher that does that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3930.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll be honest with you, Carla ran our summer program for a few years and she was amazing for our recreation program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3936.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But there's opportunities there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3939.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So like, again, I'm excited about the process and I agree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3944.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think this is, no one's gonna walk away from this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3947.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3948.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you so much for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4425.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4426.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, as I said earlier, I thought the presentation was amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4430.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand the need as a former teacher, my colleagues, relatives of teaching, family members that are in the schools, we understand that this is a definite need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4441.33s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will be voting no for the simple fact that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4444.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: part of the first reading I asked for a breakdown of our capital plan this is going to be a 20 possibly 27 million dollar project and what I asked for the meeting from the mayor's office was a meeting to discuss our capital capital projects that are in in line also talked about what the future looks like and how this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4466.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: looking to see how it would affect the renovation or the new high school project moving forward when you're looking for 20 bonding $27 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4474.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, you know, the other pieces, the whole, we still need a main street fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4480.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there was so many pieces involved with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4482.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I asked to have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4484.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4485.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No council beers has tried.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4487.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that he's still having, we will be hopefully having a meeting soon, but, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4492.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the hard work that everybody has done, but I'll be voting no because I have not gotten the information to make sure that our community understands the financial impact in totality once we vote this through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4505.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4935.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, as I stated in the first meeting, I think it's very important when we started this project, as Councilor Collins mentioned years ago, the police chief and the police department were very involved in helping us craft this ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4951.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For the fact that the police chief was not involved in this process, I will not be supporting this endeavor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4957.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4958.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any further discussion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5332.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5333.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I was the friends from Method People Power.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5337.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the conversation and the respect given in the conversation that we did have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5342.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, in discussions with the chief of police and our police department, some of these initiatives can hamper our police department to do their jobs and contradicts some of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5358.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the ordinances that are being put in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5360.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, without the police chief's involvement in this directly, I could not support this for the fact that it might hurt the community more than people think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5372.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's something that's already in place in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5376.842s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I've talked to the chief, I believe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5378.824s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in the years that he's been here, he's always been proactive and involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5382.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think he's had interaction with ICE once in the many years, but he thinks, he shared that he wasn't involved in this craft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5394.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it might leave us into some questionable findings later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5398.373s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will not be supporting this initiative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5400.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6772.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know this is so people realize Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6774.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Lerner has called me a racist for many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6777.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm a first-generation American.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6780.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My parents are immigrants from Italy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6782.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They came across legally and did exactly what had to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6788.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They love this country, and they raised a proud American.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6793.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I worked in a community that's very diverse, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6797.372s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unlike Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6797.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Lerner, I've sat in a living room with an ICE agent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6802.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and a family of illegal members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6807.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I understand the situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6810.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we just had two human rights members just say what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6814.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've worked with the chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6816.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've had the existing plan in place for five and a half years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6819.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's worked amazingly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6821.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what was mentioned last time where people are missing, when Mr. Lerner's talking about money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6829.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My fear at the time was understanding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6832.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with the city of Medford and where we are financially, is what are the financial ramifications if there is negative feedback from the federal government?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6843.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if they take money away from Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6847.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, in Cambridge, in Boston, in Somerville, they can survive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6851.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In Medford, I question if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6854.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's our basic necessities, police, fire, school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6860.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was my concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6862.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to sit there and publicly embarrass me, she's already called me racist many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6871.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's uncalled for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6876.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will share with you the process as I met with many members of these organizations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6883.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would never ever, in the spirit of any of these ordinances, they're very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6891.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as a city councilor, we have to weigh many different factors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6897.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And because I've done that, I'm labeled a racist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6902.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So shame on you, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6903.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Lerner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6904.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've given my life to this community and the people of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6908.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No matter what color, what race, it doesn't matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6913.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it's about time people stand up to the ignorance we just heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6916.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8468.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: responses over the last year as we continually struggle to effectively fund our priorities, especially our school priorities due to the cost of inflation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8476.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our administration has continued the process of reviewing department overtime budgets and procedures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8482.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Since February 2024 especially, I've been focusing on OT even more and working with all department heads that have OT line items in their budget to make sure all public funds are being used the best way possible and to make sure there is not misuse or overuse of such funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8501.289s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The city's obligation to fund overtime is necessary to ensure the general public's safety, fulfill contractual obligations, and for the efficient operations of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8510.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: However, we must be strategic in how the staffing is deployed as the funding resources are extremely limited and there are critical needs throughout our school district and city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8521.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Overtime is a crucial component<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8523.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: of every municipality's budget and operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8526.096s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need DPW crews out on the streets plowing snow, removing trees that block roadways, and other critical tasks to keep our roadways accessible and safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8535.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Police and fire OT for several reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8537.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In some circumstances, we need building inspectors to be able to visit homes and make determinations on living conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8545.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we need to manage how overtime is allocated so we don't create a situation<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8550.424s">[Scarpelli]</a>: where we're spending taxpayers' money unnecessarily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8554.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why we're working with the department heads to develop a policy that enables them to manage their time to their team effectively and implement the overtime procedures that meets the needs of our constituency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8566.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The police department has done a much better job curbing overtime and has lowered the police overtime budget from about $2 million in 2018<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8576.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to an average number of 1.2 million for the past four years, a reduction of over 35%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8582.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The fire chief and mayor's office, the human resources director, are working diligently on accountability as it relates to OT.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8589.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As one example, 28 letters have been issued to staff putting them on notice that their sick time use, which causes the need for overtime, seems excessive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8597.827s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Within the DPW, we hired DPW commissioners to help manage the department, specifically the OT budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8604.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The topic on the agenda is how overtime is managed in our building department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8608.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We cannot have a union member fielding calls and assigning overtime shifts to themselves and their fellow employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8615.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That presents a conflict that we made this change over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8619.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This did find to be necessary change, especially when almost $50,000 was paid out to overtime during the period my chief of staff was out on maternity leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8630.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our current building commissioner fields the calls from dispatch as part of department responses hierarchy and works within the written protocol to determine the immediate life safety status situations in an effort to determine the need for an inspector on scene.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8646.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If the situation does not present an urgent need to respond, the commissioner will decline to send an inspector.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8652.999s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The address is tracked and scheduled for follow-up by an inspector the next day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8658.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In instances where our commissioner is unavailable, our former commissioner is contacted and makes a determination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8664.764s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The former commission has received less than a handful of calls over the last year and has paid $60 per call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8670.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The building department continues to develop protocol and the training to fine tune the best possible responses of the concerns and staff welcome construction feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8680.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mayor Kern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8681.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8682.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, what I've been hearing is nothing what was just read.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8688.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're seeing right now is practice that we've seen that I believe that our building department, by law, if you indulge me, Mr. President, by law, Mass Amendments Building Codes, Section 116.1 Unsafe Structures,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8712.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm hearing that we have concerns with protocol that's now been lifted because of said overtime, as the mayor has stated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8722.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're seeing right now, I don't believe is true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8726.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'm seeing right now is that our building inspectors who historically have gone out and not used the overtime that's been stated for overuse or misuse,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8739.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but because it's standard and it's practice and it's making sure our constituents are safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8745.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When a structure is put in crisis, whether it's be fire or water or some kind of accident that maybe a car hits a home and it's after hours, our inspectors are called and they're the governing body that comes in to deem that facility safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8768.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're being told now is that we have a protocol in place where, because of financial reasons, we have, that's another question, we have the former director, the former commissioner of the building department still on staff being paid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8784.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It says that he's paid $60 when he's called, but I would like to know what he is paid by still being on the books.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8792.839s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if we're hurting for money, there's a question there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8797.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I've been told is that if the building department isn't called, then the fire department, the deputy on call, will make that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8809.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That is dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8811.427s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're not the governing body or the body that deems a structure safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8817.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that is a huge liability and huge safety issue and concern for our residents and our homeowners and our constituents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8826.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're seeing some very, very questionable practices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8832.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I find it very difficult that this mayor is putting this into place with other questionable reasons as we're moving forward, and I'll get to those later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8839.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we have our fire department that is thin as it is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8845.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that if no building department is called for an overtime, which is minimal, by the way, to come in and clear that, there is a trickle down effect financially that harms our community even more than any overtime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8860.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're asking for our firefighters to come down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8863.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're asking for possible detail from the fire department to sit there possibly for four, eight hours in overtime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8870.099s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then you're possibly leaving our community in crisis<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8875.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: by the ability not to have an engine back to where it should be, where it's needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8880.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Instead, it could be possibly at that site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8884.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that I don't understand why it's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8888.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that I find it very difficult to understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8892.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't an organization, a group of people that have worked very hard for this community for many, many years and done so much for us and really just do their job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8903.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're seeing some tactics by this mayor that it's very glaring against the working men and women of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8912.316s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It seems like it's very petty, and it seems like it's very vindictive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8919.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been told that our building department now has had practice on Wednesday nights, the late evening, that they would have a working dinner as a group<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8928.78s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with the commissioner for many years, this commissioner, the past commissioners, that they would come in and they would have dinner together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8937.107s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that practice has stopped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8938.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What reason?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8940.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8943.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But for the ability to have your commissioners there, when a constituent comes in and has the ability to talk to any one of the building inspectors that they're working with on site, that's a relief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8958.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now you're told that these people have to now maybe, they can leave, they can go out for the half hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8964.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now you have constituents that are accustomed to have someone there no matter what.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8968.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now that's gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8970.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8972.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Could it be that the evening before that this rule was put in place, that the union member was called into the commissioner's office to tell them<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8983.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that this practice will stop, that they can't have dinner in a common area together, that this practice stop the day after the mayor opened the door and informed these members that if they do not stop a lawsuit that we've been given and we've seen from the Teamsters, that she's gonna go public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9007.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This to me doesn't seem anything to do with overtime and our mayor taking care of this community financially, because that's a joke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9016.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're seeing over and over again is the working men and women in this community being treated unfairly and disrespected by this mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9025.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whether it's the DPW being drug tested, whether it's our DPW members of firefighters being followed by private investigators,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9036.747s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or what we hear today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9039.548s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a disgrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9040.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why our community is a mess because our mayor is childish and our mayor is putting her feelings in front of what's right in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9052.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, excuse me, but this is enough is enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9055.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to stop this practice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9057.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's causing the city to lose thousands and thousands of valuable dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9063.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we have building inspectors here this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9066.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have other members that are directly affected in this community that have expressed concerns, because there are some serious concerns here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9076.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because what I'm told, if no one else in the building department or the commissioners don't come out, and again, a commissioner that I don't understand why we're still paying, considering he's the assistant commissioner in Brockton.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9087.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why we have a sitting commissioner that's in his office today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9091.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why are we paying that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9092.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're so worried about financial issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9095.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why is it a problem?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9096.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But regardless, let's move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9099.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's say nobody comes out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9102.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you know who makes that call?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9103.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The deputy chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9106.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, I know we have one deputy chief here tonight that will tell you, I hope, that he shares that this is a huge liability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9113.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something they're not legally authorized to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9119.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you're gonna see a practice of what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9121.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry, structure inhabitable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9125.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Shut it down overtime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9127.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not because what was said that we're giving people overtime because her rules, her ridiculous rules are forcing our members to waste our city's finances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9144.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, Mr. President, this has to stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9148.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This petty, vindictive, ego-driven negativity has to stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9154.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It has to stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9157.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The morale in this community from our workers are a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9163.509s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Go up and down, go through the hallways, talk to the rank and file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9167.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, all of you, all of us have been endorsed by unions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9171.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All of us have said that we support union labor workers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9175.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what we said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9177.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When is enough enough?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9178.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When do we all stand together and say this is enough?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9182.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because we've heard it over and over again from the Teamsters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9187.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've seen it over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9188.963s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've been in meetings that we've been informed that we're paying out thousands and thousands of dollars because she is being sued and the city's being sued and they're losing case after case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9201.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When are we gonna wake up and realize, hey, maybe we didn't need an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9205.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe we just need a leader that manages our finances correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10224.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10225.186s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that I have a bunch of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10227.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that starting with, I believe, Mr. Brinch, is he still on, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10248.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I have talked to the rank and file, and I've talked to many, many members of our union, and I've talked to these members, and the understanding that the fear that they have to speak because of retaliation is evident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10266.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor has spoken over and over again how she has come to the City Hall to clean up City Hall as if this is the Wild West.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10276.563s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's said we've seen good people hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10280.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we can go all the way back because we were part of those meetings where we see how much money that have been settled on many, many occasions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10290.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we understand that we are losing money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10292.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's a reason why these union members that have the right to file grievances because they feel that they're being treated unfairly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10302.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when it goes through the process, the reason why we're losing so much money is because this administration has over and over again gone after our union workers without true facts,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10318.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and true understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10320.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is why we're losing thousands of dollars, both in legal fees for lawyers to represent the mayor and for settlements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10332.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we talk about this letter that was read by the assistant commissioner, the deputy commissioner, my question to him real quick, he started saying things that this was done, this action was taken,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10348.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with lining up our employees and going into a drug truck, testing truck, like a herd of animals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10359.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because they got calls from their wives, not them, how disgusted they were that they were treated that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10366.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's protocols in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10367.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are laws in place when you talk about drug use in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10372.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, you hit the great buzzwords and how you're there to protect and make sure that our city's safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10378.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or are we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10379.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It says in your own letter that it was put forth to the HR department and yourself months ahead of time that there was some concerns about drug use and drug issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10390.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What was done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10392.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then when it came to this syringe, when it came to this one syringe, you're talking about a public bathroom that's used by everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10402.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe the protocol that's in place by law and by statute<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10407.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and by union rules, is that the two administrators in that department have to identify employees that might be under the influence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10416.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then that gives them the course to go to get drug tested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10420.379s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not what we saw.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10422.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Instead, we saw, we heard and witnessed that our employees vindictively were taken out of the streets that were working,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10437.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: lined up and given drug tests and alcohol tests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10441.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these are interesting questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10442.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But more importantly, we have members that that are here tonight that aren't afraid to come here and shed the truth of why this resolution came up and why I had to share this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10455.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the mayor talks about public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10458.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Public safety is in the changes you've just made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10463.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll have other questions too, why Mr. Foti is even still working for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10470.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if I can, I'd rather yield to the podium, Mr. President, because we have union members that can answer a lot of these questions, because what the mayor said isn't true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10482.47s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10483.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These members have told me over and over again, different members, some afraid to come to this podium, some are here right now that can answer those questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10490.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10511.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They said that months before they were identified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10738.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10739.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that one person that was identified then with past, was it similar and was that employee the same person?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10749.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because it would be interesting to see that that one person that was, it could have been carried over because what we hear is, what I've been told by the union members themselves, something they weren't afraid to tell me, that not one person<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10764.362s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that were drug tested that day tested positive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10767.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody was negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10769.165s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's something they told me that I can openly disclose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10775.368s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not one person tested positive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10817.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So with that being said, I think it's important that we understand this policies and protocol, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10822.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That the DPW director and his deputy, if it's found that there's drug or alcohol use, they are trained to first observe those people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10834.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and then move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10836.794s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that day when we had 35 members in a line to get drug tested, in your professional opinion, did you identify them to be under the influence?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10867.859s">[Scarpelli]</a>: on this issue, and I don't wanna be the dead horse, but again, we have a bathroom that's used not just with employees, but as said by the commissioner, that is also open for contractors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10880.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We also realize that there are other avenues why people use syringes, whether it be diabetics, whether it be any other medical issues that were legitimate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10891.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's the reason why protocols are put in place that the leadership of that department,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10897.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: are trained to identify any drug use or alcohol use and then have right and course to move forward and what I've heard and what I've seen it's not didn't happen didn't happen that way and instead we put ourselves out there for another lawsuit and the attorneys that I've talked to because I can't talk to attorneys because we don't have a city solicitor the attorneys that I've talked to and when when the the the the um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10926.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the legal document that I showed them to see where we're going to be later in life with this issue, we're in trouble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10935.717s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, that's just one issue, again, of the way we're treating our union members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10940.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate that, Mr. President, but I do know that the issue in hand that was brought forth in this resolution was really about the overtime and the fear of public safety with the building inspectors not being able to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10957.159s">[Scarpelli]</a>: do their job as the governing body that's by law that should be doing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10963.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if I can, Mr. President, if my colleagues don't have any questions, I know that deputy chief has been waiting patiently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11193.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It would be interesting to see if there is a common trend with the person that has identified as having been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11208.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: caught with being tested positive and the prior incidents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11212.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That'll be interesting to know because if our HR department didn't do that due diligence when it was identified months ahead of time, I think that's a bigger problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11220.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11222.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, the issue at hand is about the overtime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11228.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the question that you bring forth over and over again is the overtime funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11233.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and not spending the money wisely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11236.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, you haven't answered the question, why the former commissioner?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11241.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I'm sure he's not doing it for $60.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11244.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sure he's still being paid just to be still on call for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11251.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because no one in all my years, that'll be interesting to know the truth, because it's just not $60 when he's called.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11286.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so he's not getting a stipend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11289.33s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not getting a stipend for being on call or being part of the city workforce still?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11297.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, he's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11298.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, careful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11369.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's not something that's locked, I know for sure, because I went the other day, it's an open bathroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11378.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's a lot of questions here, but more importantly, back to the original issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11386.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're paying the assistant director commissioner of buildings from another community to come in and pay him even a dollar<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11399.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: while we have union employees that have done this over and over again for years, but haven't gotten a contract for over three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11410.621s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I find this very, very difficult to take when it's something so simple as you're projecting that this is just me trying to save the city money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11421.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I'd like to ask you the question,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11423.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The evening when you walked in and you saw your employees sitting around a working table where they were working while they were eating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11433.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they were told to please stop the lawsuit or else you'll go public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11437.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Was that made up too, Madam Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11438.821s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I need to know this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11667.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In response, Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11670.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You make it sound so simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11674.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, it's a duck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11678.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have seen the way the firefighters have been treated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11682.424s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have seen the way the DPW members have been treated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11685.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now the building inspectors that have been treated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11688.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All of them with legitimate issues, because your administration<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11692.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: has done a poor job in following the rules and the guidelines of the union contracts that was set forth as the law of this community and our employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11704.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you can say you didn't know anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11706.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You could say that it's one person being vindictive, but there's a common denominator with all of these unions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11713.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a common denominator with all of these concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11716.526s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a common denominator with all of this money being spent for attorneys and fees and settlements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11721.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's you, Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11723.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the quicker the city realizes it, the better the city will be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11728.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because you are dividing this community and you're pointing at the hottest working people that make this city run, not you, Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11737.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So shame on you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12451.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is about truth and understanding public safety, Mr. President, so I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12465.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, so again, this is concerning because, again, if the protocol is the commissioner, and then the former commissioner, and then somebody doesn't, they don't both don't answer, then our deputy chiefs are told that's their purview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12480.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So moving forward to that if it is their purview, and we are concerned about finances, the understanding if we have a fire<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12488.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: firefighter, a deputy chief that doesn't have the bandwidth to call a structure habitable and has to leave it inhabitable, then they have to then do what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12500.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They have to bring in someone, a firefighter for overtime, and then possibly leave an engine at that site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12507.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So from what I gather, I'd like to know the information, how many times so far that our building inspector didn't pick up the phone, and then our former building inspector, who by the way, doesn't live in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12521.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it'll be interesting to see what that path leads when Mr. Young comes back up, because that's going to be interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12528.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I like to know the financial impact, and I like to know how many times both people were called<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12534.739s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and nobody responded back to our deputies when they've reached out, because I think that's more concerning, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12541.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12594.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the question is, haven't we had issues with the corporate commission, the private commission, the task commission, that we've had issues that no one did not make?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12604.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then who's left to make that decision?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12608.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And are you qualified?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12609.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12612.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that alone, for one time, is enough to stop this movement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12948.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would make a recommendation if we can as a form of a motion that we meet with the mayor and her administration to figure out the protocol.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12961.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So public safety is paramount in this situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12965.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But in the meantime, we reinstate the policy that the building inspectors that have been on call for years dealing with what their<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12976.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: charged to do by mass law, that we go back to that practice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12982.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That would be my recommendation, Mr. President, if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12984.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that an amendment to the resolution?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12986.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: An amendment to the resolution, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12988.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13191.223s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would not yield my paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13193.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If my councilors want to vote no on that, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13195.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think right now, public safety is imminent right now, waiting for a report to later<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13202.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we might be regretting that, and I don't want that ever to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13204.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for putting that forth, but I would not take place of my amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13220.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We understand, but I think where I'm asking for a vote is that this council asked the mayor to please implement what has been done in past practice to assure public safety immediately until we hear what Councilor Collins just mentioned as a very viable second option or follow-up option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13239.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that would be my recommendation, but we'll leave it to the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13243.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13260.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With the presentation of the mayor and her staff to answer all these questions, that would be fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13266.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13267.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14034.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14039.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14053.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: of our community have been clear and precise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14057.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we definitely have some issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14059.427s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe that Councilor Collins has put together a great format that we need to follow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14065.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as a council, now that we've heard this from the professionals, that right now there is serious issues and people are watching this, that God forbid if anything happens and this council didn't follow through with the correct motion<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14081.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for liability and safety of our citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14085.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a slippery slope, my friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14087.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I implore you to please, let's collectively as a group, let the mayor figure this out, but in the meantime, put the qualified people in place to make these decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14102.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because from what we've heard, if there was a fire tonight, and we have the two authorities, both the commissioner and the former commissioner not answering,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14111.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have a professional that's going to deem a home habitable or safe, which then would lead to something very dangerous and very serious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14121.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please, Mr. President, I implore my colleagues that this is so important that what we've heard already, we're not professionals at this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14132.963s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We heard from the professionals how serious it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14137.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I implore you to please listen and then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14141.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: vote to tell the mayor unanimously that we support, we bring them back to whole right now until we figure out the proper protocol.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14152.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14152.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't us against you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14155.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is common sense right in front of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14671.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, what I said was, when the commissioner and the former commissioner are not available, the fire department members are not qualified to say that a structure is safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14686.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what I said to correct what you said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14689.747s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the other piece that I want to follow up real quick with what was said is that I'd like to know, and part of this may be added on,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14701.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as a C paper, that I think people might be misunderstanding that this might be hundreds of thousands of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14709.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14710.73s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14711.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The overtime that our building inspectors are getting for overtime isn't a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14718.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're not talking about saving a teacher's job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14721.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're talking about minimal money to make sure that public safety is paramount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14727.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14728.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14993.268s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand, I thought that was my thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14995.33s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's not, can you just hold it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15112.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I met with the building department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15116.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had in depth conversation the two biggest things with size and illumination if it would affect any residents in the area, and the second would be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15125.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that if the sign, the special permit would be a hindrance for public safety in that corner area, and I was informed that both are fine, so I would move approval for the sign change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15293.051s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15293.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I apologize for the delay that we should have moved you forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15296.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if I could take it back, I would, but we see everything is in order for the, the change of business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15304.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe it's the former porch is now the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15311.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the establishment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15312.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and I believe that everything is in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15315.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I did see that the times that you're requesting fall in the parameters that do not need a special vote yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15322.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you extend those hours, we'd welcome a motion through the clerk's office to help in any way we can to make sure that we can help your business thrive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15333.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's the fear that the community heard was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15337.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that an establishment being left open and I'm so glad that that the establishment is now moving in and I see nothing to hold back Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15347.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would move approval after my colleagues have any questions or concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15482.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, we'll be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15616.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15617.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15618.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15618.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15619.417s">[Scarpelli]</a>: drop the, delay the papers 25-011, 25-012 till our next meeting, or if I have to dispose of it, I will bring it back up at a later date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/92ZcNcBM_Nk&t=830.761s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cCFTFy23gjY&t=761.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=796.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=798.297s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when you talk about, imagine doing anything for 40 years, how impressive that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=804.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what Barbara has endured for 40 years at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=810.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The beginning is a library, it's running a library and then a subpar library, then a failing library with ceilings caving in and then going through the process of a new library and maintaining an opportunity in pilot libraries across the city and working together with former City Council President Caraviello to bring to fruition a new library in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=838.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a cornerstone now, a great piece of our Medford Square entrance, and to see what Barbara has given to our community, something needs to be commended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=850.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, if I could, I would recommend, Council President, that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=854.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have Barbara here at one of our upcoming meetings so we can present her with a citation with appreciation for all of our hard work for the citizens and the residents of Medford and working at our Medford Public Library for 40 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=869.805s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Very impressive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=870.526s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Barbara, for all your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1154.494s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I found them in the order of approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1784.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1785.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1786.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm glad that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1791.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would welcome that we go, we revert this to a committee of the whole meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1795.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that when you're talking something about in the process of a $25 million project, I think this is where we need to sit down before we vote on anything and just look into the finances and what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1807.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: where we're going in our community and where we are since the override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1811.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that there are big questions out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1814.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What are we still doing with the fire department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1816.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What are we doing with the new high school if that comes down the line?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1819.563s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How much money will we be able to bond?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1821.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it'll be interesting to get those questions answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1823.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to approve $5 million not knowing, with some clarity for the other $20 million, I think that would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1829.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that would be irresponsible for us to move that forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1833.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would recommend that we move this completely to a committee of the whole meeting so we can look at the different options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1839.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know there's been some talk that there's been some money freed up from ARPA due to the override success.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1846.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it'd be interesting to see if we can use other avenues to look into possible ways to fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1853.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know it's needed, not saying that I wouldn't support it, but I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1858.768s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for one council, and we're talking about being stewards of our budgetary process, I think it's important that we sit down and evaluate the whole financial process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1868.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's nice that the school committee voted 7-0 because they should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1873.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They want everything fixed, but they don't control the budgetary process, and I think it's important that this council really understands our whole, because I believe we talked about this too, Council President, is understanding our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1887.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: capital plan and understanding where we're going with that capital plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1891.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would recommend, I appreciate your thoughts and your leadership, but I would recommend we go directly to community to the whole with this process from beginning to end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1901.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2552.29s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2553.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can you hear me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2554.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2555.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can just see social media today saying, quote, Councilor Scarpelli doesn't want to keep the kids warm and the teachers cool in the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2562.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So let's be realistic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2565.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's number one priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2567.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We all know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2568.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we also want to make sure that when I taught there 15 years ago, we had the same issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2574.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we understand that have to get done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2575.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what I'm saying is I don't see a few weeks<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2579.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to track back and really understand the total process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2582.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, all due respect, Tom, thank you for your presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2585.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't even know who you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2585.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we paying you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2587.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like we don't, there's processes like, you know, how is the procurement process look?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2593.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How are we going to, has issues with the MSBA been approved yet for 25 million?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2600.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2600.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: have we looked at other avenues do we look at the trajectory of our city's finances when we're looking to how we're going to bomb this so i think that this is this isn't something that we're saying at least this council saying that i don't want this this is council wants to just bring it back and look at this in totality not because the city school committee voted seven nothing because we have issues like the air condition is not going to work in august<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2625.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a few weeks that we slow things down and go through the process the correct way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2629.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's to see the full health of our financial future here in the city of Medford because I'd like to know, there might be more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2637.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There might be more that we don't know about because this is coming up<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2641.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we have to look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2641.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have to look at what's relatively new and how quick this is and how much it's going to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2644.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Where as we look forward, there might be more that the mayor has has planned, but we don't know about that says, Well, there's another five million that we have to look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2652.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the kids can go into a safe school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2654.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe something's wrong with the doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2656.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know yet because we haven't been discussing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2659.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All we received is this this motion for a loan order and to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2669.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: my council vice president bring that forward and was seconded, but I won't be supporting it for the fact that I'd rather have the meeting before we put five, move $5 million that we can start the process before we know truly what our fiscal overview looks like in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2685.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Cause that's something that's been questioned multiple times in the last few months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2690.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4190.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can we hear papers 24-518, 24-519 please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4218.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4219.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't say just it's been on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4306.621s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4308.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thanks for allowing this to go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4309.922s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that as we've spoken about in the past, I think that with the passing of the override, I think every dollar that is going to come through the city coffers I'm going to bring forward because of the lack of transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4325.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You'll see that there's a trend tonight as we look at different resolutions that lack of transparency or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4336.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: lack of information for our residents to understand the process as we move forward have been a big issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4343.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that understanding phone calls I received as soon as we get the news that the superintendent's contract has just been bought out, and mutually, by the way, I don't know what that means, but when you have someone for a contract,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4361.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: so especially someone that's worked so hard for the community you'd want to see that to the end and i think that not knowing what that that number is that dollar number is and how much these ramifications are going to hit our community i think it's important when you have all these questions about the override and where the money's going where it's truly going and as the mayor said she would have a transparent process i'm just moving this forward to ask that we get a detailed report from the mayor's office<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4388.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, uh, describing the cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4392.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um impact that's going to hit this city by paying off a superintendent, um, to go home now and, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4403.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: collective paycheck to do nothing while we're now moving an assistant superintendent forward an interim role and what that cost will be in the trickle down effect to costs that are going to have to now pick up her slack financially in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4417.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4419.005s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't a secret.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4421.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope no one here is offended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4422.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I told everybody here I will question every single penny moving forward, especially after the override vote and anything that would be a little questionable when it comes to processes that as soon as the override is passed, we settle a buyout for a superintendent to move her out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4442.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that is going to be super important that we have that, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4447.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I request that from our administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4451.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The second is I'm glad to hear that Mia did respond back to us about our bond rating for Moody's that people didn't know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4462.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we were taken off the bond rating by Moody's, one of our investment companies that give us our bond rating because of some technical issues with filing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4474.78s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe I was told, I'm not sure, but I think that we're here that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4480.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that is back on, we're back on top and our bond rating has been restored.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4484.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's also good to know that we truly don't use Moody's too often or if any, when we look at our bonds, but I think it's important that when something goes out, especially when we're talking about what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4496.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: financial mismanagement, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4498.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what do we hear?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4499.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All of a sudden, Moody's has dropped Medford because of A, B and C. So I appreciate the mayor's response today, letting us know that that has been restored.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4510.692s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I would amend this paper, if we could, to ask a report to be presented to the City Council on the reasoning why<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4518.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we would lose a bond rating, because I think that's more alarming in totality to not just getting the bond back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4527.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think, yay, we got it back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4528.855s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think what's important, we talk about the issues we had, especially during the time of the override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4533.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about mismanagement of our city's finances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4536.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that we need to see if we can, Mr. President, to amend the paper to ask for that report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4545.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4547.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Next is to be resolved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4549.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The city administration cease and desist the use of private investigators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4553.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was told that we have had multiple employees that under contract are being followed by private investigators, and this is getting to be a real problem because what's happening in our community, whether you want to see it or not,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4570.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our community is being divided in so many different levels, and the administration is the catalyst behind this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4576.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're seeing practices of following hard-working members of our community off of rumors to follow them around the Commonwealth to see if they're doing something wrong during their contractual sick days, and that's wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4594.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sure everybody here has said and they fight for unions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4596.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if you truly fight for unions, I hope you stand with me to get a true indication of where our tax dollars are going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4603.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if these rumors again, the reason why we hear the mayor is sent out private investigators because of rumors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4610.73s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I as one Councilor, if we're going to play that game, I am now responding to rumors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4617.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that I want to report back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4618.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If this is a practice, I need an update and understand the cost that's attributed to these these, um, these private investigators and where what line item they're coming from and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4633.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: want a full report, what this practice, how much it's cost us from the beginning to the end, and if they have found anything dealing with any private investigators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4642.427s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that, you know, we have one DPW member that's now gone, that has settled for a big number, that's, he's home now, counting his money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4651.953s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that was one of the instances that, looking back, I'd love to see what it's cost us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4657.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I'm gonna bring it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4660.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had an override, $500,000 to fix all of our streets and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4665.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, let's see where this money is going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4667.459s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think this is important that we see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4669.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And last but not least, what I heard the other day, I find it appalling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4673.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that this is, again, another example of the division of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4680.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody wants that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4681.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What do we have the other day?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4682.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have DPW members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4684.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We were commending DPW members because of their hard work and their commitment to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4690.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But in the same breath, we're gonna hear that in this resolution that just the other day, I was informed that I believe 45 DPW members, staff members were brought in to do drug testing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4707.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's a blatant<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4709.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: blatant problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4712.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my question that I can ask right now is how much did it cost us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4716.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what do we find with these these these processes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4721.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I think it's important that we need to know because these members that are here are the people that get up every day and go to work without any question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4729.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now they're understaffed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4731.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're underpaid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4733.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are the people that, remember, we plotted because, what, while everybody was sleeping and doors were shut and everything was buckled down during the pandemic?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4742.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, they were fired, there were police, and there were DPW workers that were killing themselves every single day for this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4748.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know the mayor talks about the pandemic, and we want to talk about it when it sounds good, but these men and women, what happened last week, that's a serious problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4756.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And for one member of this leadership team in this city, I think that we have to have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4762.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: emotion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4763.079s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have to have information that stops this from happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4766.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Enough is enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4768.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our city is damaged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4769.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our state is damaged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4770.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our nation is damaged as it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4772.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't need any more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4775.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that there is a representative here from the Teamsters that's represented the union that could explain some important information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4781.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I welcome that when it's time, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4784.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I think it's important for this council right now to understand this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4789.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we all know that, you know, we can't come from the city because of personnel issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4793.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you what I can ask for is what the funding what it costs this this community by I believe it was drug testing and alcohol testing, I believe, for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4805.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: all of the city employees that were, by the way, working on our streets, in our schools, in our parks, on our sidewalks, that were called back to the yard, that had to sit in a room and then be embarrassed and disgraced to get drug tested for no reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4825.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, Mr. President, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4948.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4948.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, Clarity, you're saying the mayor says that so to ask for a a report from the school department, is she is she saying that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4959.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we going to get a report financially so we can understand the ramifications financially for buying out the superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4966.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that you have nothing to do with it, but did she give you any indication?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4969.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because to me it sounds like, you know, go pound sand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4972.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're moving on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4981.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As the budgetary stewards of this community that vote on that budget,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4986.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm demanding a report, Council President, if you may, to the mayor to break down the financial ramifications of the buyout to the superintendent and what that means to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4998.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5079.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5079.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to get the tip of tap, but as the mayor just said in her response, when you hear a rumor, she takes up full responsibility to make sure we know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5090.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As fiscal stewards of this community, when the city council, when the school committee mutually ends a contract, and yes, there is a bio with it, there is a financial<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5103.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a financial responsibility to the city by the superintendent leaving early.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5108.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why I'm asking for the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5110.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why I'm asking the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5111.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not asking for anything bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5113.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not saying anybody did anything wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5114.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All I'm asking for is a report so we can see what the financial ramifications are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5120.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: by having this buyout, not just with the superintendent, whatever it costs us, if it costs us anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5125.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They come back and say it costs us nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5127.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what is it going to cost us for an interim?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5130.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What's that increase?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5132.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What is the trickle-down effect?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5133.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who's going to take up those responsibilities?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5135.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who's going to pay those people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5137.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are they going to get paid?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5138.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't think this is something that's very confusing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5141.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This, believe me, this is pretty clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5144.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when I asked for a resolution, the resolution doesn't seem to be too dumbfounding, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5149.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's pretty self-explanatory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5151.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All this council is asking for, ladies and gentlemen, is just a report on the breakdown of the mutual buyout or the mutual dismissal of the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5161.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5165.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not trying to make this more than it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5370.223s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just think that, I think I'll say it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5372.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I, and I, for what this community has just gone through in November,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5378.331s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's important that we do question everything because everybody's asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5384.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So either it's on the city side, school side, it comes, it's coming out of our city's budget and there are questions that aren't being asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5393.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when residents come to me and say, what are the implications financially, especially after an override, it just doesn't smell right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5401.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why I'm saying these are the, these are the important things that all that is, is just,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5405.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: showing the information, understanding the information moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5409.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we talk about accountability, don't you think it's about time that the mayor is held accountable?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5414.953s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, don't we think that this administration is held accountable?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5419.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5421.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So she's getting a free pass by hiding behind different levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5427.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the bottom line is enough is enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5429.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to fix this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5431.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6874.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Mr. President, I think that if I can have the representative from local 25<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6882.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that part of this process, I think that there was a clear trend in meaning behind my resolutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6891.92s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know it was something that's horrible and it's something that would be vetted out properly in the courts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6900.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that what was clear is making sure that our community understood a few things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6908.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is one, we get a report that breaks down the funding mechanism and how money's being spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6914.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the first thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6916.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The second thing is that understanding the process that our leadership in this community in the mayor's office is lacking and it's causing a huge divide in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6927.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, we've talked about the police today, 900 days without a contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6931.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're talking about the firefighters having some serious issues right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6936.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, and then right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6937.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we're talking about right now is what I need to know is how much just this one is an issue cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6945.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then you brought up a good point, Mr. Hatch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6946.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You said that, you know, how many communities do you work with?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6950.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you can, can you, what, what are they?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6952.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you can, do you know what, what communities...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6978.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, I think that the question I need to ask you, you've obviously represented those communities and you've had leaders in those communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6988.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it an anomaly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6990.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is this a trend that we're seeing just because we're in Medford, we're isolated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6993.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know by working in a municipality for the last 18 years, I see the difference, but most people don't understand that some people actually come to the city of Medford say, this is the norm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7005.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what a mayor is supposed to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7007.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: can you just shed just a little light on your experience and your other communities?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7013.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you see the same trends and do you see the same financial impact to their communities that we're seeing here in Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7083.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: OK, so that's my final question is this, because this is what the point is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7088.168s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The amount of money we spent on drug testing and breathalyzers for these employees is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7094.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wanna see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7096.191s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I would love to see the cost that to the Teamsters, because we're not getting the true indication of what the city is paying for our attorneys, because we don't have a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7105.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would like, if you can, if you could report back to the council and just give us an idea of what the Teamsters pay, their council,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7114.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and fighting method issues, because that will at least give us a true indication that in the last five and a half years, we've seen that the teams have paid X amount of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7126.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And from what I gather, it should be pretty equivalent to see where our money is going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7131.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I'm bringing this forward to the community so we can understand a major impact to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7137.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I bring up the override every time because we talk about mismanagement of funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7142.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when we have the representatives of 14 other communities, and we hear that this doesn't happen anywhere else, that's a red flag.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7151.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I know what was happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7153.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't like it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7155.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We stand against it 1,000% as human beings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7158.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But truly, the intent for this resolution is really to understand, A, the financial impact that we're seeing in all of my other resolutions I put in place, and then B, again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7171.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the lack of true transparency and true leadership with the mayor of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7177.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7179.579s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I apologize that things are getting heated again, but I know it's something that's very emotional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7186.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I talked to at least 10 DPW workers that call me directly that I've grown up with, I've been friends with, that were absolutely appalled and embarrassed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7194.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Their wives called me and said, this is a disgrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7197.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What my husband had to endure today was a disgrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7201.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I can't speak to that more than I can, or I wish I could because I would have called the city solicitor and asked him how far I can go with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7210.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I know that you have put forth the civil rights lawsuit, I believe against the mayor and against the city, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7217.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's going to be interesting to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7219.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, another financial impact to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7223.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7236.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That'll be interesting, because I know that this administration, what they love to do is they like to come back and say, oh, in Everett, they pay this much, and in Malden, they pay this much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7246.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'd like to see is what you pay out to fight issues legally with Everett, with Melrose,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7255.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Chelsea with Cambridge, just to get a true indication how poorly mismanaged this community is when it comes to fiscal transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7428.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's talking about when we talk about when you're voting on funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7433.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't a financial paper voting on funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7436.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a resolution asking for financial documents that are spent by the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7441.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not asking for spending money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7443.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a negative way to get out of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7446.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I tell you, I'm embarrassed that that just happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7486.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't a finance paper, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7489.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a resolution asking for not to fund a finance paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7494.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's to ask, inquire of how much was funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7498.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That has nothing to do with financial intent for the rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7502.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you know what it is, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7504.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't know why we're doing this on a phone show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7506.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're smarter than this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7507.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Don't embarrass this council like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7509.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is nothing to do about calling for rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7513.487s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're talking about moving money forward in a financial resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7518.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is not the intent of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7519.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please don't do this again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7546.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7886.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It seems like it's kind of a no-win scenario for the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8437.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Villes isn't wrong that the line item for the legal department is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8442.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the warrant articles that we have, I'll give you an example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8445.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have them all right here because I have them ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8448.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And from month to month, I could break it down with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8452.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm coming with you tomorrow, Mr. Jones, and I'll show you, I'll give you an example right off the bat, which was alarming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8457.187s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In June of 2023,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8460.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the city of method paid KP law through the warrant articles, not in the law, not in the law item in different, different departments over $230,000 just for that one month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8471.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will come and I'll share this information with you just to see council bears isn't wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8476.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The line item for the legal department isn't, they take exactly what they're supposed to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8480.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8481.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the Warren articles that we get month to month, you could see the breakdown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8485.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You could see the expenditures to KP law for different departments for hundreds of thousands of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8612.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But he said rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8613.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8613.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm glad you figured out what you made a mistake by when I invoked rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8623.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8624.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8913.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If that would help to get the information that we're looking for, I would be amenable to changing the language so we can get some information through the administration to see if these are the practices and if they are where we stand as a council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8929.518s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would be willing to make those amendments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9310.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you want to look at this process and make sure that the wording is correct, just to get some information, the truth of the matter is just understanding the cost impact on drug tests for DPW employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9336.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and report back what our drug policies are for all city employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9340.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9447.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9448.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the union representative was very clear in the process and the policies when to be drug tested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9454.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, regardless what the federal laws are, but there are agreements and laws that were made, uh, in, in negotiation to make sure that these weren't violated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9465.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that the mayor has that, uh, to be honest with you, that would be very clear and understandable for everybody here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9472.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Cause she definitely violated that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9616.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council asked for when we had the the chief chief Evans here when we talked about the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9627.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the report then was presented to the deputies and the chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9631.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we were waiting on a meeting to inform the council of what their findings were with that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9647.922s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9656.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they would be included in that executive session because you're bringing them in to discuss personal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9662.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They have to be there for talking about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9663.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's the intent of executive session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9698.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9701.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the second piece, Council President, if you want to leave it open-ended, after consulting the legal team, that we then have the ability to go to executive sessions so they see fit, or they deem it approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9778.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that the process that this council's totality voted to fund this report and having an open forum, having the report presented to the public and then go to executive session through open meeting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9798.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but as a committee, a committee, a meeting with all the, all the members of this council, because they think that committee of the whole versus the public health and safety committee, I'd rather, I'd rather that if that was the option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9834.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9834.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9835.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10022.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that I know that had a great discussion with our director, that there were some questions with the process of notification in our processes through the city council, whether they were done legally, and they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10043.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, the software that we have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10045.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When the resolution is opened and moves forward, it's not written out in totality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10051.045s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So people didn't see that tonight's would be the final vote for Mystic Ave rezoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10059.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're informed that the process was done correctly and that if there is a way that we can look in the future to try to share that information to make sure that there aren't any questions moving forward, I think that'll be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10647.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's in height, not stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10652.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the recommended is height though, and best practice is height?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10664.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it shows both?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10672.681s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10770.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just, I know that we've been, I'm going to be redundant and I know that this is my, my cry from the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10776.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, and I know the director has tried and we've, we've talked about this and informing the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10782.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we've done, um, you know, what you feel is due diligence, but I'm going to stick with what, what this council prior really wanted to see was really bringing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10794.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: these meetings to the neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10796.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I did talk to residents of the corridor and business owners, and I know that you've corrected me a few times and said, George, we put it in the water bill, we've gone directly to the businesses, but the members that have reached out to me, the neighbors that I've talked to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10816.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: truly don't understand the process still.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10818.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that there are some restrictions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10820.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, when you look at our zoning process, we still, we're only Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10824.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that really hurts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10826.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So people really can't get involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10828.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think, again, I think this is my biggest battle is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10835.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we're moving forward, I really would like to see us go into the neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10838.474s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know Innes said they would look to see if it's possible to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10841.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that that was part of the RFP that I read that we looked at back in the day when we first started this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10846.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I just think that's important, especially when you're making these changes that we haven't done in 100 years, that residents feel like they've been listened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10856.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we've done a lot of listening sessions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10859.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've had a lot of meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10860.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I think that that last piece, I feel, is a big void.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10864.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we need to go to the neighborhood, and I'm gonna stand on my soapbox to the end with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10870.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12381.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're gonna be sick of hearing me tonight, but we see everything in its order, Mr. Rafferty, and I really drove by today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12388.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The front door looks amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12390.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's really inviting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12391.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm so happy that you're gonna have Saria A games there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12395.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's so funny that- Yes, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12396.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12397.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12398.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I see everything, so I move approval as long as my fellow colleagues have no other questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13225.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13226.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First, I want to thank Barry and Marie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13232.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: having a conversation and really having an open dialogue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13236.168s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we expressed a lot of information about this ordinance and having my support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13243.353s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that my biggest concern are two basic issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13247.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one thing I'll ask is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13250.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as I get started is I'd like to see this to be tabled so we can sit with the chief because I don't think that we've had a conversation with the chief and understand the impacts with the police department when we make an ordinance and how it could conflict with the city ordinance and what his job requires him to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13269.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that he, you know, I think that that's, you know, the understanding that the ACLU, the support and the involvement of the ACLU has left some residents questioning, you know, their beliefs in what policing is and what this means with this ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13287.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13290.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the understanding the slippery slopes when we talk about, we talk about this, this ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13296.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I've talked to the chief and I've talked to city officials, when chief Sacco put together the federal immigration enforcement plan and really put this in place, you know, they shared that, you know, the number one priority is our community safety and comfort of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13312.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think it's important because I think this is very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13315.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think I can sit here<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13320.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and attest that as a city councilor, I've sat in a house, I've stood in a house with six ICE agents and a family of undocumented members of a community and, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13332.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know the fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13333.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13334.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I also think that when we move something toward an ordinance, I think we need to do our due diligence and make sure that we really have the information and we're all coming into this as a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13345.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I talked to the chief and the chief has been part of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13350.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a very important piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13351.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that having the chief of police sit down with our body and say, what are some limitations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13359.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What are some concerns?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13360.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How do we fix that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13361.763s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How do we express it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13363.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How do we bring it forward so we can move forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13366.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That hasn't been done yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13367.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13368.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think before we move forward, I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13370.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that table moving into a meeting to sit with the chief and understand that this is a process so we can all understand what the ramification is as a law enforcement officer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13380.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because we don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13381.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're doing something that means well, and we want to do something to protect people, which is good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13387.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think we're talking about an ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13388.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we need all the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13390.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think we have done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13390.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the other piece, and I would also like to invite the administration, the financial director, for the other impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13400.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it is gonna be a different time in a few weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13406.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we've seen it openly discussed how communities that put ordinances or rules in place like this, that the national agenda is to harm us financially with federal funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13421.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we need to also understand that platform.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13424.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, it's not something that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13429.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this council is not supporting for the good reasons, but I think it's important that we get all the information out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13434.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's goodwill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13436.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It feels good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13437.02s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People have done some great work and really put a lot of passion into this, and I commend them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13442.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I can't support this unless we do our due diligence and sit down with the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13448.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: probably the most important person in this community, the person that actually does our policing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13453.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he's always been involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13455.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's always been welcoming to come sit down with us and share his opinion and see what our police department and what those impacts means when you talk about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13466.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: changing an ordinance to what they do every day by law and how that might be intertwined in a negative fashion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13473.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's something that I'm going to stand with and I hope my colleagues can understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13479.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13782.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, I would request that at least you not waive the three readings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13788.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would hate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13791.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just, I, again, I think that I talked to the chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13797.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that it'd be something that it would be fruitful for us to understand the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13802.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13803.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, with the last administration, both the house and the Senate now fall<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13810.071s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with one party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13810.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, there's going to be a that's something that when I've talked to my my contacts at the higher level, this is what the fair is now is understanding that there isn't an option to stop the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16976.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16977.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you recall, this process was very well vetted by the chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16986.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there were so many concerns that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16989.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: he talked about with public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16991.917s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know this was in subcommittee, and we're coming right to the floor with this and understanding that this is clearly politics over public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17004.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is frightening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17007.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a process without having the chief involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17010.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's where you're stepping overbound, because I remember those days, he was heavily involved, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17017.907s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to hear that he wasn't part of this because these are some of the things he definitely talked about that helped him keep our residents safe and our community safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17027.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I remember that specifically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17029.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And him not being here and us just pushing these through, I just think it's wrong right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17035.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I wish that you would table this to sit with the chief and have him review this to see the impacts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17042.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, we're seeing what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17043.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I, you know, I've talked to neighboring communities and understanding that, you know, I understand the process and the understanding where, um, how it can affect people in a negative way, but the pros outweigh the cons in so many ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17060.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, look how they look, look how they found the murder, the gentleman who killed the, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17068.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in New York City.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17069.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was all by surveillance camera, by following him around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17072.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They took a murder off the street that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17075.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're looking to put into action policies that take away that ability for our police and our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17085.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just think this is stepping over a line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17088.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that, you know, we just don't do this at 12 o'clock at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17094.756s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know, but to do it at 12 o'clock at night and not have the process over just a subcommittee meeting where everybody wasn't privy to it and then come to here today and start moving these ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18492.907s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I too talked to Rocco DiRico.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18494.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First, I think we're very fortunate both between Barbara and Rocco and having liaisons from Tufts University that pick up the phone the minute we call them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18503.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's a huge benefit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18506.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I truly believe what our neighbors are saying when you talk about, you know, these different corridors and you look at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18516.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, 12 stories, and how frightening that is, and Tufts even conceding to 10 stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18524.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I've seen all the concessions that Tufts made, and I've been fortunate enough to be involved with a mayor that was directly involved with Tufts University.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18535.913s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he allowed me to watch him be a partner, but make sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18544.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: his community was present and getting the best with that community needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18549.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what's frightening to me is what we see, and I'm gonna be critical and I could care less if anybody cares or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18557.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's 1215, so who cares?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18560.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when we are talking about this mayor and the process that's been happening since August, and all of a sudden she comes out now, well, she should have been present from the beginning when you talk about our neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18574.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and their impact of the quality of life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18577.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're seeing it all over the community, by the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18580.186s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why the community is now focused on creating groups and paying attorneys and fighting because they don't believe that this administration can fight for their rights and their beliefs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18597.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18599.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I too disagree with the size of this dormitory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18606.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the fact that everybody is focused on housing and how important it is, but I truly don't think it's going to impact the housing like people think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18619.142s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have two kids in college, and the first thing they wanted to do is get out of a dorm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18628.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wish that it's gonna open up some housing around that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18632.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just don't see it happening, but I also see the impact that this is gonna make for residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18639.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but again, I did see and had discussions with Mr. DeRico and understanding the information that was put out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18655.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and how many people they touched to make sure that everybody knew about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18658.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One thing you knew in that neighborhood, people knew that Tufts was putting forth this development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18665.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And people were talking about it, but it seemed like nobody was listening until the 12th hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18669.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now all of a sudden, we're scrambling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18671.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I think the truth of the matter is, if you talk to Tufts University and you said, as much as we love our environmental plan,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18680.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe some concessions would have been made to alleviate some of those big ticket items that could have supported maybe dropping it down to eight stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18691.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it wouldn't affected a quarter of the shading for the neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18696.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But there were no discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18698.33s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're coming in right now and hoping that people do the right thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18703.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, when it comes time, I think this community should really wake up and understand what has this administration done in the last five and a half years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18716.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And are you willing to give these people another two years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18719.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because it's not working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18722.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That office is not working for this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18725.487s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20544.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20545.518s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, as we start this process, you know, we're now seeing that we're now delving into more residential neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20554.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my request and recommendation would be to hold our next public meeting at the Roberts Elementary School, where it could be a process for all the people that feel that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20568.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they haven't been heard, or they feel that they haven't been able to come to these meetings, that we put this meeting into their backyard as requested back when we wrote the RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20579.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I know we've been trying our best to be more transparent and give more people an opportunity to share and be part of the process, but I would truly recommend as a motion that we ask to move<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20595.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: one of the final meetings to the neighborhood directly so we can hear from the neighbors in their backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20604.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would make that as a form of motion if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20611.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20619.796s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whichever, I know that we have, when is that next?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20624.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right after CD, if we can, after that, if we can come back and get some input from the neighbors that we can present that the CB, their ideas and their input, and then really get the neighbors' involvement and at least be part of that final solution and the changes that are gonna be made there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3191.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3193.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate all the hard work and a lot of the questions that I really have is really based on just the information that I'm getting from residents and there are some that are very easy for me to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3208.041s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh explained to to eliminate some fear and and and and rumors that were going around and I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3216.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was wondering if if our friends from Ennis can just have you ever been given a request because a resident asked and I said I I would reach out<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3225.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh for for city councilors and for uh people that have been educated when it talks about zoning and it's it's easy to follow but have have you ever been requested from a community that you've worked with to try to maybe simplify some of these definitions and maybe a bullet point<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3246.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: type of report where where this meeting when they we talk about parking and understanding the offsets when it you know the biggest fear i'm here i give you a good example is the situation that we're dealing with and with tufts university and a 10-story building and how it affects residential homes and it's it's it's clearly defined in this process when we see the the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3275.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the changes that we're looking at and how the residential area, we won't see those types of drastic changes where some residents are fearful for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3292.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So have you ever been requested, and this would be my request, that after a report is given like we've put together tonight, very thorough, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3303.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to without embarrassing or disrespecting anyone, have you ever been asked to put together a bullet point that really simplifies what was discussed today so just the average person can read and understand the basic points that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3321.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have gone through because I, I think this is where it's overwhelming and this is where people I know council beers and council vice president and our director have put together an extensive plan to make sure that we're reaching our communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3336.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I've been standing on my soapbox and really saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3340.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, bringing our meetings to the neighborhoods where people can ask these simplified questions, because I think a lot of people that have reached out to me are a little intimidated by the language and this format, which I believe we can all agree to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3354.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, again, if there's any way that we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3358.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: some sort of a format that can be simplified so people can understand what the major changes are and what the processes are, I think would be super helpful if you can help with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3371.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3414.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think the diagrams have been super helpful that because that's one thing that is really simplified that I hate to say it, but to show people pictures with what the changes will be made it very simple to explain to some people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3429.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I appreciate that council vice president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3606.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1605.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, thank you, uh, uh, gentlemen chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1608.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate first your assistance and these endeavors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1612.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, uh, to be clear, I think that not to confuse everybody, but this is, this is what the conjunction with the, um, the charter committee that's been working so hard throughout the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1623.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't, I know that I had a question with, uh, just a text that the message text message saying, is this different?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1629.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, no, it's, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1631.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is all conjunction, so this is a big team effort and making sure that we're putting the best product out and making sure that we have the best information moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1640.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we send this off to the state house that we're all in 1 breath.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1644.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, I just wanted to clarify that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1647.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, and then, uh, if I can having the gentleman at the podium this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1653.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Frank Wright, one of the most well-respected city auditors that I've ever worked with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1658.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I really appreciate his presence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1660.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then Frank, if you need a job, Method's looking for a city solicitor and we could do anything you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1667.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=2599.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=414.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=415.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And thank you for my fellow colleagues to add me to this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=419.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it speaks volumes for me as a school team member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=423.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was part of that group that was first initiated with the thought of, hey, there's a program that we really want to start here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=432.969s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's called Crew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=434.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we didn't have a slip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=436.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't have any docks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=438.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't have a boathouse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=439.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't have anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=441.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we were borrowing skulls from different<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=444.77s">[Scarpelli]</a>: different colleges and they were donating them to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=447.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it really started so and you know, it's just a fad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=451.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I what you realize is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=455.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: committed young people really drove this when we first started it to where we are today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=460.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think it's so amazing that we have state champions in front of us right now with committed coaches and kids looking to go to the next level, colleges, universities, and participate in crew at that level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=474.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's just amazing feet and see where we've gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=476.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you know what, I'll say it here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=477.827s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've talked to a bunch of parents that I work in recreation and one of the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=481.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the most attractive pieces of our puzzle in Somerville is our boathouse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=490.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we can do, we have summer programs using rowing crew and the different avenues of community that crew really brings to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=501.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll say it publicly, I would love to see the mayor<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=507.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: use our CPA money to look down the line to building us a true boathouse over at home else stadium I think that, to me, would be full circle and look at something that you know we have an avenue, we have a funding mechanism in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=521.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now all we need is a reason for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=524.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you've given us this reason tenfold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=526.105s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I want to congratulate all of you coaches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=529.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that Mr. Maloney was in the forefront years ago when people told him that this wasn't going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=534.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe if maybe some people remember, when we first started, they put a couple of rowing machines<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=542.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in what's now the boys locker basketball locker room in the gym.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=546.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it still there do you guys still use that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=549.105s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was like that's all we had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=550.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had four, and people were just taking turns, jumping in so we've gone a long way so I commend all of you for pushing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=559.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's amazing when you listen to other people from different communities, when they talk about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=565.692s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What Medford crew is doing at the regard is and what they're doing at different events, and how you're seeing sportsmanship and and pride in community and this is what it's all about, you know, in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=577.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Traditionally, it was what hockey, football, baseball, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=581.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now you're seeing lifetime sports where you're seeing people using crew to go to the next level in academia, and then taking that to the next level and really promoting something that's really healthy and positive in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=596.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know I'm winded, but I just wanted to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=599.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had the vision when this came forth of when this started, when I was on the school committee and seeing where it is today, just amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=608.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I like so much pride with all the medals on our athletes and coaches standing there stoically and I appreciate all this hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=616.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you and congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=816.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Cullohan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1349.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1350.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It truly was the victory, the first time greater Boston League champion since the early 90s.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1358.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First time announced tonight, first time we've had a greater Boston League MVP and Justin Marino.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1365.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So many kids now coach Curley and his coaching staff ascending off to play at the next level that you have, and you're talking about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1374.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a group of kids that without football wouldn't have an opportunity to get to the next level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1378.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what's amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1381.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I really want to stress is how impressed I am with the football program for what they do for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1389.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you see the wins and Thanksgiving, that's great, touchdowns, and everybody's happy about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1394.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I find more amazing is what they did the week before when they went to the shelter and they<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1402.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They prepared a couple of the, what am I thinking, Zach?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1411.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The food, it wasn't the meals, they were doing the different community centers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1420.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, so they really, the pantry, excuse me, thank you for helping me with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1424.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But they were setting up the food pantries and helping with stock and share and present that to the community members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1433.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You'll see them this winter, delivering, shoveling seniors out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1440.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what you're seeing right now is a true champion in the sense that, forget about the wins and losses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1447.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Coach for 32 years, you seldom remember those truly what they're going to remember is what they did as a team and as a family as being part of a community and really giving back to the community so I congratulate coach curly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1463.221s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Chris Murphy, who's the President of the Mustang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1467.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: football program and what they do for our community and give them back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1471.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I would love to invite them to our next meeting, if we can, Mr. President, to them and our next guests and the band and really celebrate what they've done, both on the field and off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1483.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's equally important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1484.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1830.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll share, I'll share, I'll share with everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2161.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had some phone calls after and I think that the biggest concern was the private process of tree removal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2170.437s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Residents were really concerned with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2172.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: their freedoms and what they have control on their properties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2175.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that at the time KP law did say that that could be viewed as taking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2181.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that that's something that will be reviewed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2184.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that as people ask me, this is the process, it's gonna be vetted through the process and we'll get a clearer understanding as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2192.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for that, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2443.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2445.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see, is Mr. Silva here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2447.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2448.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2449.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2451.681s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe this is just a carry over from the previous owner who his family had owned it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2461.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The Calais family owned the donut shop for many, many years, a fixture in the Mefford community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2470.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm so happy that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2473.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Silva stepped up and kept this location alive because it is something that I remember when I was a kid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2485.541s">[Scarpelli]</a>: After church, dad would go over to Demet's and pick up the healthy donuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2492.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They weren't the bad ones at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2495.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I appreciate the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2499.169s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Looks like everything, Mr. President, is in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2503.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, I think the only questions we have is, you know, the number of employees, the hours are staying the same, and that would be it on my end, but I don't see anything that would prohibit us to move this forward after my colleagues share any thoughts, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2596.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we just, honestly, if we have any other questions, this is a pretty straightforward petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2603.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything is in order, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2604.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2606.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If Mr. Silva can add anything, maybe reach out to the clerk for a next meeting, but I don't want to hold this up any longer if it's something that's just technical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2635.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It is a change of ownership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2636.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Seems like just a change of ownership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2679.761s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Should ask for an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2795.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just one question to the attorney while we have the hours of operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2800.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you continue those with us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2810.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2810.868s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that sometimes when they go outside that I just would like to remind the petitioner that if it's later that that had to go through the process as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2820.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, Mr. President, I see everything in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2824.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm excited that we don't have an empty storefront and we see a responsible owner coming in and taking over and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2834.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And like I said, everything's in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2838.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would move for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2839.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My colleagues have any comments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2277.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2281.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate all your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2285.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that presentation was great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2287.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I'm going to be the person that people call because they're nervous about what they hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2293.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what's good is that we're having meetings so we can express the rumors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2304.236s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the fact that they're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2306.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: being permitted, we're going to look at zoning for 12 stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2310.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's nice to see that's not going to happen on Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2314.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We appreciate all your hard work with that and making sure that that message is out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2319.107s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that when we talk to residents from that corridor, the biggest concern they have, not just the people on the main drag, but on the budding streets, is making sure that we have parking, making sure that they're seeing different<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2335.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: different processes that are happening that are taking parking away from a business district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2341.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's one of the things there, you know, the business owners that I've talked to this weekend, they were really concerned about that because they're all small businesses and it's very important that, although we can hope that it's just gonna be a walkable transit, public transit corridor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2360.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the truth of the matter is that's not necessarily true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2363.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So having an open mind when we look at what the total community looks for, I appreciate my colleagues doing a better job, I think, and getting the word out, but I will share with you that there is still the need to put that comprehensive plan that we asked for in the RFP to go into the Salem Street neighborhood and have those neighbors that can't come here or join us on Zoom<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2386.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that want to really get involved and understand what happens in that quarter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2391.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that you're seeing this, you're seeing fractions of the community right now where neighborhoods are rallying and creating neighborhood groups and getting attorneys and fighting zoning everywhere because the truth of the matter is there isn't enough, there is enough information that's out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2413.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's nice to say that there are people getting it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2416.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: there are a lot of people that aren't getting information on what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2419.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, I mean, I try to do my best and I'll share this information for the people that have reached out to me and said, George, we're concerned 12 stories on Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2428.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, this is easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2429.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's no such thing as 12 stories on Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2432.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but you know, it's nice to see that looking at pieces like the MBTA area where maybe redeveloping that area where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2444.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it made Salem Street look like such an eyesore as a, you know, gateway to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2450.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I think that that's when you see successful zoning changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2454.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You see neighbor communities really using the gateway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2457.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the communities is really enhancing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2459.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that we have some limitations for businesses that are there, but I'm glad to see that we're looking at, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2471.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: being responsible to our neighbors and our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2474.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm excited to see a change on Salem Street where we have mixed-use areas and we're seeing more storefronts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2482.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're seeing more families walking that corridor and looking at, you know, having little pockets of, you know, sitting areas with fountains and, you know, but I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2493.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now that we've seen it, and we know all the hard work that we put forward with this, is that really getting the true message out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2500.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's all I'm saying, because I'm saying that, you know, in other situations that we're seeing in the community, where there is concerns that they're going to an extreme, you're seeing some pretty extreme things happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2512.362s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is so good and so new that I think we really have to find other avenues to reach<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2520.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: more of our residents in that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2523.584s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whatever we have to do, I know that, you know, I know Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2526.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hunt you've explained and it's tough that other communities have big, big departments and we have a small department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2532.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2533.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why when we talked with the last council, we really stressed the fact that no matter what it took in the mayor's office for the city to put that into the RFP where our zoning partners can come in and bring teams in just like neighboring communities have done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2548.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like I said, as we're moving forward, I love the clarity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2552.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see it, but I think that there are a lot of people that don't see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2556.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's the biggest concern right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2559.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because it's great if everybody rallies around this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2561.98s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It makes everything a lot smoother, believe me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2565.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate your work, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1743.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Ted, for you and your team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1746.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know you guys have been super busy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1749.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I think that questions people ask, usually this is later in the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1753.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would assume that this is tied into what's gonna happen in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1758.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: which is the increase of the override to people's taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1762.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the phone calls I received, should we come to these meetings, can we stop it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1767.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I tried to explain to residents that, you know, so they can understand in layman terms that this is a tax rate that we are not going to put forth and whatever this council decides, plus what the override is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1783.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So someone that's a million dollar home, you'll see, you know, that 7,800, 7,500 a year tax now then increased another, I know one resident<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1794.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: was quoted about $800 for their home for an addition on top of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1799.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think this is why people are asking, why are we doing this meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1803.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's, you know, I want to make sure it's clear that we're doing this so we can, that we give your team enough time to set this rate, then we can move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1812.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So in January, everything will be in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1814.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So just to let everybody know, it is happening in January that the override<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1820.929s">[Scarpelli]</a>: increase will be added in top of this, which the rates were, the new assessment, like was said, was assessed from the 2023 sales home sales, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1832.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1833.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's one thing I wanted to make sure that everybody knows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1838.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that, again, to be clear, this is year after year that the override tax doesn't disappear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1845.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This just increases plus two and a half percent, if that so be it, every year to follow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1850.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's what the questions were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1855.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then the other thing that's confusing people when you talk about new growth, when you hear new growth in communities that have a booming commercial base or you're seeing a new tax revenue coming from new development,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1872.407s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the new growth we haven't seen much in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1875.509s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I want people to understand the new growth that we've been talking about during the override, it's new growth coming from increasing taxes that we see as the levy increases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1888.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I want people to understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1889.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that was very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1892.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was a question that's been brought up saying that, oh no, they've heard from some councils that said that Medford was number one in Massachusetts in new growth, which isn't true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1902.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just wanted to make sure that those points were just brought up tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1909.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's a different new growth<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1911.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we talk about new growth and development is very different than what you talked about tonight, and new growth and tax assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1918.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So am I correct with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1919.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to speak for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1946.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1947.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then I think that the last piece is what everybody's asking for now is what Mr. Castagnetti has been saying for years is the owner occupied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1956.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's a slippery slope because it sounds so easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1958.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my neighbor who's 86 years old said, George, if this, if you vote in the tax exemption, I'm living a single family home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1966.969s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I'm if the exemption goes through for homeowners and I get my taxes would be lower than what they were in the previous years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1974.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said that's true, but when you look at the way we look at the big picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1979.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It affects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1981.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: majority of our residents in a negative way, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1984.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Their tax will increase even higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2019.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the word is out that Somerville does it, Cambridge does it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2022.048s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why is it beneficial for their communities?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2023.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What do they have that we don't that allows them to do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2040.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So typically, communities like that will adopt it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2043.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2044.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2045.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: appreciate all the hard work you guys, your team has done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2048.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's been, uh, I know it's been trying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2050.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that you were on the hot seat a month ago and I apologize for any, any, um, you know, um, uncomfortable questions that were asked, but I know it was, you stood there and did a wonderful job and, and, uh, we, you know, appreciate getting that out the Friday, the week before, so people can get a better understanding of what it looked like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2069.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2070.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's why we had such a close vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2073.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was very close because of that fact that people started realizing the true numbers and the effects that we're gonna have on the homeowners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2079.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2081.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3909.351s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're seeing things that, unfortunately, your department<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3914.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been tasked to do things way too late, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3919.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm glad to see my fellow colleagues are now realizing after they supported the override that how the vulnerable community is really gonna hurt now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3929.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're hurting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3930.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's something that I welcome the conversation starting earlier now to look at that homeowner exemption because of that demographic that I was screaming about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3944.065s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that bought their homes for $50,000, but now they're worth a million, and they're being priced out with additional override taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3952.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm glad to hear that we're at least understanding it now, and that there's pain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3959.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's going to be something that we should do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3961.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know if you'll be here in June to do that with us, but we really need to look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3966.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3968.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We also have to be alarmed, as some residents have said when we talked about this issue, is that the burden falls on who?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3975.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It falls on the homeowners that have rental properties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3980.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those are the ones that are going to pick up the burden if the exemption comes into play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3984.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the fear now is the talk that was started last year was rent control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3990.553s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that this is something that this community should really pay close attention to because there's a machine that's going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4000.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: there's a system in place and people have to see what's happening with our council in the direction they've been moving to, whether it was, you know, transfer tax, whether it's fees for a registry, whether it's an override, whether it's a homeowner exemption now and looking at rent control possibly in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4020.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a lot that this city is gonna be moving to if people don't realize and get more involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4028.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This administration, like my colleague said has done a, at least from what I gather, she was saying she was saying that they've done a terrible job, really preparing this community, and what avenues we can take to give us the best choices possible, both in a, a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4047.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a speedy override discussion without the input and without the proper timing during the budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4056.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now here we go with the assessment and the levy that we have to look at, look at homeowner exemption as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4065.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I appreciate what my colleagues have said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4069.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's something that we can't do anything today, but it's something that we, I think, have to look at early.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4078.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: earlier in the season now, when we get to the budget season to make sure we have enough money in the overlay to make sure that if we have that 49.9% of homeowners that apply for the exemption, that we can cover that cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4091.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, thank you for everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4574.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4687.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Motion to not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1588.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1673.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1674.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that I appreciate all the hard work everybody's done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1678.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know this has been a long time coming, and there's just a couple of concerns that residents have reached out to me about that couldn't make it to this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1685.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that Commissioner McGiven helped with a lot of those questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1691.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that as honorable and as lucky as we are to have a committee of dedicated members of our community, I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1703.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: really that there is some fear that having a community group making decisions that affect homeowners left some questions with our residents, but I appreciate the clear questions and definitions from Commissioner McGiven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1721.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2387.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilors, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2388.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And please forgive me, I was hoping, I know that we might, I guess we had a glitch early in the meeting, so I have to pop out again in a few minutes to shut down a program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2401.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just wanted to, if I can jump in a little bit early, just to give some comments, if that's okay, President Bez.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2406.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2409.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate Commissioner McGiven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2411.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's kind of the questions that I had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2414.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Also with former Commissioner Forte, we really had some in-depth conversation with him and his vision with what he saw as the enforcement piece as we moved, especially to the private protection piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2430.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that in my situation, I do think that this is a lot of work and there's a lot of work that was done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2438.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were so many changes that I hope that we do move on to another meeting with our city department heads because I think it's important that we do do a cost analysis and especially moving into the next budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2451.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with all the new money we have looking into bringing qualified professionals into departments that can handle such a task.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2461.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think what I'm hearing is, and I won't speak for Commissioner McGiven, but it sounds like this will really overwhelm our existing team in comparison to what they're already doing today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2475.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2477.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I had a brief discussion with the building commission today was great and he's ready to do everything and anything possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2484.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as you look at the private tree protection, I think 1 of the biggest concerns that we had starting a few years ago is really.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2494.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: um, having government come in and tell residents what they can do on their own property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2500.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, and this isn't this, this doesn't affect thousands of trees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2504.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think this affects many trees, but I think it does affect the quality of life and the expectations of homeowners that might want to, um, you know, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2516.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have some I have to be very careful with my ethics when we talk about solar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2521.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm going to leave that to the side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2523.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But there's some questions the other residents had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2526.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that I think Attorney Stein did put in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2531.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh, some legal pieces when it came into the opinion of subject of challenge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2536.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, if we wrote in an ordinance and making some of these changes to the private, uh, tree protection plan, I think that, uh, that that might be again, that's something we talked about in the past and many, many meetings about being a slippery slope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2550.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the former commissioner, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2555.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh, uh, Forte really had a plan in place that he was willing to share with us that is used in neighboring communities that really didn't affect most members of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2565.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I fully support when we talk about new development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2569.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, I fully support when we have people coming in and flipping houses and taking down trees to, to, uh, find a way to mitigate that with the tree fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2579.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's a superb idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2580.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's something that will really benefit moving forward with, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2585.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: taking care of our tree canopy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2586.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2587.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But, um, again, I think there are still so many questions when it comes to the price, especially the private piece and the implementation pieces with either the DPW and their tree service team and, um, the building commissioner and his team when it comes to, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2608.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: moving forward with any of these added duties with the tree process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2614.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I apologize for leaving early.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2619.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate you allowing me, Council President, to share the concerns that was offered to me from some residents and historically what we've been talking about for many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2630.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I do wanna see this move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2633.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, in any way, try to hold this back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2635.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we have so many great ideas, and I think that, uh, our volunteers did a great job to help design and and craft an ordinance that really has some meat on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2649.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think with a lot of these red line changes, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2653.928s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A lot of people were confused as well in what was happening and we're a little nervous about there'll be a vote tonight, but I do think this is a good piece to, you know, my recommendation, move this to another meeting and bring all the city staff with some, after they've revisited all of these changes and put together a plan on how we could really make this work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2674.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I thank everybody and I apologize for my dismissal, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2717.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, I thank you and I now leave the meeting so you can speed up your half and not waiting on roll calls, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2724.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1188.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1190.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1191.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is such a welcoming addition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1196.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that especially when you hear some of the bantering of the negativity of the pop-up park and the parking lot where there's no shade, there's nothing that really attracts<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1208.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: families to that area in the concept that we're seeing here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1212.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think this really fills a gap in Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1216.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is something I'll support 1,000%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1220.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The question I had is I know that we've had residents that made that the chess hub of the world, it seemed, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1228.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know one resident worked very hard<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1233.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the tables there, the chest tables and those coverings going to be able to shade those areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1265.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, if you can, just if you can reach out to the resident, I'll share his information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1269.544s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sure you know it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1270.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1270.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if you can just, you know, even maybe get him involved in saying, okay, as you kind of built this area and really made it when people didn't know what it was going to be used for, he kind of made it a home for families and kids that really needed an area to meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1287.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that it was, it was a great vision and great opportunity for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1291.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate all your hard work and I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1293.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is going to be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1294.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2478.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I know, you know, this is such a great gesture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2481.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's exactly your heart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2482.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we appreciate that because you know what it does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2486.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think we'll ever forget Larry, but just a little symbol to keep Larry's light alive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2492.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is a great fitting tribute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2493.609s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for that idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2495.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that if there is something that if we need to make sure that happens and look for some other alternative funding, I think that we as a council should try to find some other avenues to make sure that that happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2507.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that'd be a great gesture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2678.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Leming, I believe there's a resident that has their hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3397.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Chair Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3398.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate all the hard work we're doing, and I know that I sound like a broken record, but I know as we move forward with, I know Director Hunt's on as well,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3409.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, I know I read what we tried to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3413.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We originally, when we first started this process with the RFP for, um, zoning consultants and making sure that we brought these, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3424.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: these steps to the neighborhoods and to the communities that were rezoning step-by-step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3431.917s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's something I thought the former council really stressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3435.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that it would help with, we can see lately a lot of misinformation going out and making sure that the right information goes out and going into those neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3448.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that one of the biggest concerns that I keep hearing is that, you know, Salem Street,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3453.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is being rezoned for 12 stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3455.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now I know we're, um, you know, we're saying no, but you have people out there that are spinning a dialogue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3463.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have to make sure that, um, you know, I know that one thing that we asked for in the RFP when, and it's, um, applied for it was a comprehensive plan for, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3474.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: meeting with the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3476.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that we've said that we've had multiple meetings with in this setting, and I don't disagree, but again, I really would recommend that we look at that process and bring it to the neighborhoods where the neighborhoods can really share what they want their neighborhood to look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3497.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think like we've talked about when we rezoned<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3501.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: many as a as a department head in Somerville I was directly involved in the rezoning of different areas in the community where we use this example back a few years ago why we thought it was so important um chair Leming that we had um different city departments like recreation police fire um dpw where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3527.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as you put these plans out and these zoning reforms out, that people really felt that they were part of the process and they were helping design what their neighborhoods wanted to look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3539.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you can tell me I'm wrong, but I really would stress that we could follow through with that in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3546.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3640.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, that, that's, that's, uh, that's if I can, Mr. No, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3665.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I apologize that I missed the beginning of the meeting, but as a fitting city council play again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3672.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, my import is is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3675.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is, uh, a piece that's coming from our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3678.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate council beers, uh, for, uh, expanding on those efforts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3684.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's a, that's a great effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3686.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's something that going back to those residents that have reached out to me and let them know that that's coming down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3692.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's going to be super helpful as we move forward to make sure everybody feels like that's part of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3697.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you very much for your leadership on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3838.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3839.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's great information to share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3841.105s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's where my problem comes in, Commissioner Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3845.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, when we did the RFP, we we knew our limitations in your office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3853.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's why we asked to put that in the RFP to bring in the capable staff of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3861.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and it's to come in and work with those communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3865.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I find it disheartening that we knew that this isn't a secret that we don't have enough staff in your office, but this is why we asked to be put in, and this is why it's written in the RFP as a comprehensive<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3881.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: comprehensive plan for outreach for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3884.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate everything you've done way more than what we talked about the last couple of weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3891.34s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3892.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I'm going to implore that we find a way to go into the neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3899.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just don't, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3902.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: everybody has to have an opportunity to get involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3907.168s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And like I said, I appreciate what Councilor Beaz is doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3909.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate what your response was and how we're trying to get the information out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3915.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But believe it or not, there's still a big gap between the people that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3921.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that would make it that would make an effort to come into their community and to their neighborhoods to talk about what their visions are to share those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3928.666s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again I know our limitations but again I revert back to our RFP where it's it says that it was and we were pretty clear when we started talking about the RFP as a council that this is the vision why and to all due respect um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3948.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We all agreed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3950.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't think one person didn't agree that this is the type of format that we need to go into the neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3955.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I apologize to be a Debbie Downer, especially with some of the good information that we've heard tonight to get the information out, but I'm sorry, I still think that's not, it's not what we asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3969.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=938.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: resolution stated that it go to governance committee to discuss COLA raises.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=945.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now it's that, so in essence, this is saying that the city council shouldn't be voting for their own raises and that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=954.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=955.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm just.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1027.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if I can, because I received numerous calls, as you can imagine, because the way it read really alarmed a lot of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1036.16s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This has been a very trying week, both on the national level and also in the local level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1043.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And part of the discussions and making sure that the residents know is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1049.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, after such a close vote and half of the community split over the override and so much contention still left in the community to divide the fact that we had elected officials, especially the mayor dancing in celebration that half of the community is going to be in pain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1066.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, to add this, the next day was so, you know, for the next meeting was very, very touching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1072.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1073.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just I don't know where this is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1075.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have our own ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1076.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have our own rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1078.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It seems like the way I read it is someone maybe talked to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1082.351s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Your friends might have talked to you and told you don't do this the day after an override vote because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1088.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this community needs a lot to heal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1091.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And in the process that we went through and the questions we had with the original raise, I don't even understand why this is on there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1097.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would imagine you should rule it out of order, Mr. President, just for the fact that, as you already stated, these are things that we've already had in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1105.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, as as the senior member of this council and understanding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1110.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know historically why people join this council in the past is really being part of the community and looking at this position as a full-time position should never be looked at a full-time not Medford maybe in a major city but in the city of Medford to even look at a salary adjustment in any way to move forward I think it's totally disingenuine especially the week that we had last week so I would um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1135.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My I will know anyway, but I would hope that this would be ruled out of order and disperse because this doesn't say anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1144.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It said something early that really riled the whole community up and then looking for a cola when we have we have departments that haven't gotten a raise in years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1155.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1155.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have city departments that go three years without raises or colds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1160.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that was something that just to let you know, this is what I'm saying this out loud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1164.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the people that are watching because they were very interested in what was being said tonight that to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1171.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to review this isn't, hopefully this isn't asking for any sort of Kohler adjustment like other communities or anything like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1180.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Until we take care of our own here, I think that we should stay away from this completely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1184.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Stay away from any money paper when it's talking about funding this council a penny more after fiscal crisis and what we went through on Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1192.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1602.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why would you say that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1603.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not part of any group, I'm a member of many groups, but to say that you use my name in that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1611.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can use the best metrics in so many different ways that this person did, and just embarrass my community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1624.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't send anything out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1626.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So don't use my name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1629.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Use my name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1631.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a meeting, tell them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1672.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The comments that have been said around this oval that we're talking about, these are conversations I've had with people that have reached out to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1680.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what was said, what was written in the original may be changed after someone woke up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1685.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But whereas the Medford School Committee recently went 24 years without a cost of living adjustment, COLA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1692.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now this starts to think, well, what does it say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1695.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're looking for COLA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1696.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are the questions they asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1698.792s">[Scarpelli]</a>: be it resolved that the governance committee take up the ordinance to disallow the city council from passing salary change to affected city officials, and to encourage the city council to consider regular color adjustments for elected officials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1710.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's exactly what it says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1713.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't say it wasn't for next year, but what I'm saying is the phone calls I received and the understanding that I'm trying to explain to my people, and if those people are my people, the ones that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1725.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that the 60,000 that live in this community, those are those people that had those questions after a very contentious election cycle on Tuesday night, and then put this forward the way it was written.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1738.304s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You could spin it any way you want today, but that's how it was written, and that's why there were questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1744.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So any organization to put on email that spun anything anyway, take it for what it's worth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1750.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because this councilor over and over again, whenever I brought anything forward, have backed it up with video or specific instances that all of you have witnessed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1762.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these are makeup things that have been going on here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1766.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5369.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, to follow up with Councilor Collins, these are the initiatives that really show the community that we're really looking out for the best interest to our most vulnerable and our veterans sure are vulnerable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5384.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for putting this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=115.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Test one, two, two tests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1269.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've talked to the election commissioners and they said that these rules are all posted<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1275.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: at City Hall and the election in the elections office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1277.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if anybody does need some clarity that the election office does have all this information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1283.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1731.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Would you like to read that first, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1930.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And thank you for Mrs. Tomaszczuk bringing forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1931.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know I've talked to a few of our friends in the audience and I think there was some confusion first that people seem to thought it was about the pop-up park, but it's not about the pop-up park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1943.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The issues and concerns are something that we'll hear again later on tonight is that the way we're doing business in Medford is that we're really not getting the community involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1955.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know they wanna say the community gets involved, but the truth of the matter is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1961.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let me ask our seniors if we know that we have valuable land here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1966.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And unfortunately, I think there has to be an understanding that we need some growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1972.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if there was a partnership where we brought the process to the seniors and said, this is how we're going to look at the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1982.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We wanna make sure that all of your concerns are taken care of and get your input so you can share what you're afraid of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1991.716s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and making sure that we fill those gaps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1994.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sure none of you have had that conversation with anybody from the city, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1997.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct me if I'm wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1999.202s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so this is what we're seeing right now in Medford, is that as we're going through our zoning changes, one thing we talked about was really going into the communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2009.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We put that in the RFP actually, about when we rezone, when we look at projects like this, we go into those communities, just like neighbor communities do when they do big projects like Assembly Row,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2019.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and they do big projects like Union Square in Somerville, they actually bring city staff to the neighborhood where people come out and talk to you and you can share your concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2029.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm hoping moving forward by coming to this podium, there is an issue, there is a concern, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2037.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not gonna say that we don't need new growth and development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2040.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not gonna say that, I won't lie to you and tell you that I don't think that we need to use these parcels<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2046.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to make a change to really invest in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2049.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same time, what we need is an understanding and a form of partnership where our seniors can say, okay, if you're going to take this lot, what lot are we going to build<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2064.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and to make sure that it's similar vicinity that our seniors can park and walk across the street or walk next door so we can accommodate all of the programs that you said are so important to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2076.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think moving forward, I think that we have a, you know, I hear you loud and clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2082.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I'm going to advocate to make sure that as we move forward, especially with this RFP and these five parcels I heard that I think it's three, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2090.379s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I also told there was maybe five that are coming down the line that it's going to encompass the whole square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2095.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're going to see drastic changes here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2098.526s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it seems like we're forgetting the most vulnerable people in our community, mostly our seniors, and saying, well, let's just move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2106.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm welcoming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2108.274s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll share my information, my phone number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2110.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you feel fear in any way, give me a call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2113.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let me at least try to be a voice as we go through this process, because unfortunately, it's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2119.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2119.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that it could happen with a partnership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2123.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So everybody's involved to make sure that all the concerns that you have are addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2129.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you're not going to sleep thinking, are we going to lose the grieving program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2132.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to lose the knitting program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2134.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to lose this program because there's nowhere to park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2137.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's going to be important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2138.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just want to share that with you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2141.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that from what I've talked to a few of the seniors offline, and I think after this conversation I shared with them, they felt a little bit better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2151.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that we really need a buy-in from the city administration to work with our seniors, not just bring you cookies and pizza on election week, but really sit down with you and say, hey, what do you really need?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2162.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And making sure that your needs are met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2164.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3221.474s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3221.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just just a point of information maybe some clarity for the planning department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3226.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the question that was reported back to me that part of the RP that the mentioned the mayor mentioned was that it was a looking at 40 spots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3236.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for the new developers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3237.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that doesn't even come close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3239.423s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think this is why having this conversation is a beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3243.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think it's before it gets too late because we're down the line with other projects in the city that our community hasn't been involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3252.514s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I say community, it's having those meetings at the senior center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3258.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when you set a vision of what you want this to look like, what you want Medford Square to look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3262.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is where you bring in the business community, because some business members that were at that chamber meeting, really, they weren't very excited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3269.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's some question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3270.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But that's why you have these meetings open to everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3273.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you sit there with all the department heads, your planning department, your recreation department, your fire department, your police department, because there's so many things that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3282.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when you look at development that have to be considered, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3286.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do we, if we build this many<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3288.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we bring in this many people, are we going to have the infrastructure DPW can carry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3293.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we build it, bring in this many people, are we going to have enough police?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3296.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we going to have fire?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3298.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's so many, so many, and I only speak on this on as, as, as person who does this as a department head in the past, I worked for municipality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3307.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we do is before, before the city came out and just started giving out RFPs and getting the idea of the developers, because that's the problem with Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3317.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we bring the developers in to get their idea first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3319.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Isn't that, that's a shame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3321.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the issue is in other communities what happens is you bring your stakeholders in first with the plans that were were derived that Medford has spent millions of dollars on that dust some of those off and say well these plans say this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3335.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So where do you feel and what do you fit?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3337.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the first thing we see is our senior citizens have already come out and said what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3340.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're scared that we're going to be overlooked and bypassed because one of the basic necessities we have is parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3348.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that could be something that you look at at a meeting like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3352.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm hoping that the mayor really, really readjust and understand the process when it comes to the December proposals that come in, that we reassess again and look at the true process of true development and true input from our community, where we bring the meeting to you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3370.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not somewhere that you have to find one, you have to find where this meeting is and then go out and look for it and then not have the proper people in that can answer the questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3378.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But neighboring communities, what they do is they bring everybody in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3381.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So every question is answered right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3384.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So then we could set up a comprehensive plan that involves all the stakeholders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3390.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, that means that not everybody's gonna be happy with some of the decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3395.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but at least they can look at outcomes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3397.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know one of the things we talked about in my neighboring community was it was affecting the process for one of our senior areas in Union Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3405.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So part of the deal was that we would have a shuttle system in place that would be built in with the developers that we don't need senior citizens who didn't need the parking in that area for it was identified for a small group, I think it was 50 people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3420.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they looked at how they would shuttle the seniors in, and that was part of the contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3426.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's being creative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3428.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, that's at least giving you an option to give you calm and understand that people are looking out for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3435.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because a friend that came up to the podium said that our seniors are afraid that we're being forgotten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3441.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3443.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've heard that in the last, especially three months in the process, we're seeing what's happening on election day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3449.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We hear you, at least I hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3451.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we need to really put our money where our mouth is and really start opening up the dialogue with the most vulnerable members of our community, unfortunately, which are our seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3460.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Councilor Bearsley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3512.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the concern with that response was that not everybody is getting informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3519.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what I'm hearing from everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3521.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You might just check a box and say, we're having a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3524.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, I understand the comprehensive plans that have been going on for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3526.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We spend millions of dollars on it, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3528.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what we're seeing, what I'm hearing, especially firsthand from our seniors, is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3533.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: people are getting surveyed that then they say there's a survey of people say they've been spoken to people said there were meetings, but no one really knows when it seems like just a certain group understands against this message, because the average person, and you can look at what we have here in the auditorium today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3549.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they're not getting the message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3550.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if that's the case, Council President, we need to do a better job as a community and a leadership in the city is to educate all of our members of our community so they can get involved with these processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3562.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4313.714s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4591.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4591.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, President Council, let me bring this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4594.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because this is the outside the box thinking that we need to protect that most vulnerable, especially when you talk about the times we're in today so I and I think that Council saying is correct I think that what might help some people that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4606.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, there are some people out there that'll question everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4609.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think the city assessor could really support us by showing how the tax levy is, how many, if we looked at how many veterans needed the support and what that would look like and who would carry the brunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4625.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think if you asked nine out of 10 residents that we can support our seniors, I mean, our veterans,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4635.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and helping them through this process, I think that it would be supported wholeheartedly, but I think it would be good just to see that number, because I don't think it'd be drastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4646.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4709.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4808.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4810.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was informed that our, um, the consultant that this body approved its funding, um, has finished their assessment and has presented to the chief and his leadership team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4825.258s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one thing that I found, um, that really struck me is that back in September, um, maybe the fire, um, our partners from the method fight apartment can help us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4838.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4839.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had, I know the mayor spoke on a podcast that mentioned the consultant directly and stating some pretty damaging wordage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4852.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would imagine that that letter<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4855.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is public and is part of this body's purview to overview and use that input to help our residents, especially when they come up to Tuesday's meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4867.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know the Chief's here, and I know that President Marcellino's here from the Firefighters Union, and I know that, I believe the mayor used the consultant's words, she said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4879.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If she didn't fix the culture dysfunction with the fire department that someone could get hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4884.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's something she used to support her efforts, moving against anything to deal with the fire department but I think that that's something that is alarming to me when I heard it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4894.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4896.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the consultant is completed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4898.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One of the biggest issues that we're hearing right now and discrepancies that we're hearing from both the fire, um, firefighters themselves, the fire union who have come out publicly and chief Freeman, who was here the other day that spoke openly about the design of the fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4917.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4919.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know how people want to look at the situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4921.509s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it's one side or the other, I don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4923.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that there should be only one side, and that's what we need in our community for our fire station, the best design possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4930.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that I would imagine that, and correct me if I'm wrong, maybe Chief Evans can come up, that the pot of that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4939.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: discussion must have been around a new design of a headquarters and getting some information out to the public, whether it's a, I know we're very popular with press releases, but really sharing any information that's given through a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4955.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: third party per se.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4956.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not the yes group, it's not the no group, it's a third party that's come into the city and done an evaluation that the mayor has requested that this council has paid for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4965.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would hope that we can get that information out before the election on Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4970.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know a lot of people have already gone out and voted, but I think that understanding what a consultant might think of that design might play a huge factor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4978.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now again, if it's the fact that there isn't any information in those documents about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4985.169s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the design, then I stand corrected and we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4990.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think it would be interesting to see if that was part of that consultant's purview to share their opinion when it comes to our main street<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5001.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: fire department and it's designed for a new station because I know that a lot of people right now are in flux whether they're going to support it or not and if it's something that comes out and says no there are some design that he does support what the administration is saying that this is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5018.949s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All perfect and it's ready to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5020.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know the chief supported it through the letter that the mayor read in her blog or her report that it's definitely that he supports the design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5031.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that having a party that is an outside specialist, I'd like to see if maybe the chief or anybody from the union has heard anything that can help us get that word out to the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5047.692s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5090.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, it could be released, especially with the election coming up in November about support or not supporting the fire design of the project, that if the consultant had information that we can share before the election day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5133.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's nothing in the design that consultants about their thought of the design?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5142.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I don't know what I'm just saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5144.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it's not, it's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5144.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm just saying that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5146.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what I would do if we can, um, as well as, uh, appreciate that, that eliminates any, um, any, any thought process of trying to answer some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5156.739s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that if we can, Mr. President, that we do motion that we have, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5162.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if the consultant can come out later on after this as soon as we can to really review all of the findings with this council and if it needs to be to go to executive session that we go to an executive session because I know we as a council had some questions about having the fire department and talking with them about some concerns and maybe opening up executive session for them as well so I would put that in a form of a motion and hopefully we can do that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5190.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: before before the new year if we can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5192.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5204.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now that the chief has answered that, that there's nothing in the report that, you know, I thought that that might be interesting to see if a third party had some initial thoughts on that in the report, but if they don't, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5217.16s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's now we know if they don't, if we could just rephrase that, Mr. President, that we call for a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5223.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: um a meeting uh before the new year it doesn't have to be right away now with the fire department and um the consultant to review their findings thank you got it so i would amend the resolution to um remove the question about the fire headquarters and then change it to requesting to attend a future council meeting to explain the findings perfect thank you mr president got it do you have that amendment mr clerk<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5609.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council Collins for leading our zoning team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5613.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that this is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5615.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: agreed 1000%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5617.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to move it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5618.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we've been looking, looking into this for so many years but I just again, I bring forth the understanding that of course we've had a lot of meetings, we can see that there's been plenty of meetings but one of the things that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5631.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we made sure with the past council that we really made sure that we tried to incorporate the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5639.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now you could say that we've had these meetings been open up to everybody and this is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5644.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not what we talked about when we started the RFP process back<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5648.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: back many many years ago the conversation really was and I hope there's still time to do this is bringing the meetings to those neighborhoods and getting the input from our citizenry and with a comprehensive plan together with all the departments together and getting the vision of what everybody wants to do and making sure that all of the needs are going to be met in that neighborhood<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5672.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I revert to the RFP that was written and the scope of work that it says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5681.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: public outreach the consultant will develop a public outreach strategy designed to inform the community stakeholders and the general public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5689.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The strategy and design was brought up into the fact that what we were doing in Somerville as a department leader that really shined the light and made everybody feel like stakeholders<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5704.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I remember these meetings specifically that we all understood and agreed that going into these meetings, sitting down as a team, looking to see what everybody wants in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5714.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we talked about my process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5716.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about how recreation played a process when we wanted to look at Union Square and how that process was derived and how it was built together with stakeholders at those meetings in their backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5728.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we've had a thousand meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5730.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that people have been informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5732.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but it's not what we asked for as a council a few years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5736.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what part of the RFP was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5738.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I'll state the comment that was made in a meeting when we were deciding this and we were talking about this in March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5746.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli said, he thinks the most important thing in the community's input is community-based meetings, meaning in that zoning community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5755.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, this is something that I'm making up because I wanna be negative or I don't wanna do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5761.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm gonna move forward with it, because I think we need to move forward with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5764.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But in the same vein, we have the whole community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5767.539s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been talking with the people from Salem Street, and they feel the same way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5772.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one's talked to them, no one sat with them in their backyard at the Roberts, like we did in Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5778.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We go right in their yard, go to the Roberts Elementary School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5781.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You bring the neighbors there and say, okay, this is a proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5783.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're looking to redevelop part of Salem Street to 12 stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5788.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, if you ask the people on Salem Street today, no one was really informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5792.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one really understood the process and no different what we're hearing on Mr. Cav.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5796.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5799.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know we need this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5800.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know we need the reform.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5802.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've supported this from the get-go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5804.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we do need is the truth of what hasn't been done, and that's what was written in the RFP, to have community-based meetings to involve the areas that are being rezoned to get their input and make them feel like they're part of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5817.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not all of a sudden they come in and say, well, there's 12 stories coming up and we really weren't part of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5824.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, no, we've had 36 meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5825.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know we've had 36 meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5827.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I'm telling you again, when we talk about surveys, and I'll use Carr Park as an example, when they did Carr Park over, we talked to Alicia saying that everybody was surveyed in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5839.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I live a few streets away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5840.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I wasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5841.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I asked my neighbors, no, they weren't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5843.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're seeing the same thing as we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5845.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, this is the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5846.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we could still catch this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5849.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But all I implore to my council colleagues<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5853.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to do what was asked in the RFP and I'll make a motion to revisit or ask for the plan that associates must have because it's part of the scope of work of what they viewed envisioned of what the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5868.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the community outreaches because to me, we're not reaching them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5872.427s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, like I said, I'm going to support this because I think it needs to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5876.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But in the same vein, before it gets too into the process, we really need to start having these community meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5882.575s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We really need to start informing our residents more about being part of this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5888.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they're not shocked two years down the line when all of a sudden their neighborhood has changed so drastically that they can't live there anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5896.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6034.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for myself so I can share this with the community is what that breakdown really means for the community input one on ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6043.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, I think that that would be important to Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6045.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, um, I don't think it will be a concern or an issue or a violation to bring the meetings into neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6054.274s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done this in the past many, many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6056.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, I think that that that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6059.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that wouldn't be a hindrance at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6061.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I appreciate the words, but again, I do think that we should do more, like you said, and maybe outreaching and doing something in their communities, in those neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6073.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7730.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hello?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7732.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it me you're looking for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7733.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can you hear that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7736.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Chief, I know that recently I saw, I think it was a Stoneham truck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7755.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's what's great with the fire department in your world that we can reach out to our brothers and sisters from neighboring communities to help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7762.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that my thing is that I know that as we look forward to the capital plan that the mayor put out, we know we have two trucks coming, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7772.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that there were questions last year that we wanted to order two more, but if we didn't do it a certain time, it would be,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7781.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: drastic, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7782.01s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what is I know the two are coming in 20 is it 2026?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7798.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so it looks like we need some band aids to get us through these first two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7803.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then I know that do you know when the plan is for the other two was part of our 14 plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7809.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7810.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, that if we can, Mr. President, as part of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7814.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just get an update on the mayor's capital plan about the I know that we wanted to but waiting for two more fire trucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7821.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think because if we keep we keep band aiding and keep it'll be no different than what we're seeing with the streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7836.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's only so much bubble gum and duct tape that we can purchase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7840.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that these are serious issues and making sure our firefighters have, you know, it'd be funny if everybody jumps into Bobby's oil truck to go fight a fire because we don't have a truck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7853.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I think that I completely understand<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7859.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: where we're going with this and it's if it's needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7863.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand but I have other questions but I yield to my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8019.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, okay, darn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8072.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8312.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8374.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Due to the situation with the override on November 5th, I would invoke rule 21<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8381.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to move this to the next meeting after the override for the fact that without understanding the true emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8398.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would invoke rule 21 and move this to the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8401.487s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8548.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8549.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8551.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can you define paper way so people can understand what that means, because a lot of people like where's paper way in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8558.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we can just explain that a little bit that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8635.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, that's out of necessity, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8637.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because of some structural issues to Joseph's way, is that what I'm?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8683.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I'm looking at it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8686.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It looks pretty dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8687.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=587.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=588.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=590.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the hard work, but I think that one of the questions that I've been, um, that I've, I've received from the constituents is that when we wrote this RFP, we're getting to the point where, um, the question is down to a rise that is, is that we need to be answered is that when we wrote the RFP and we asked for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=610.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh, in this to be the that were awarded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=613.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We were talking about the process of going into the neighborhoods that our zoning changes would be affected so we can have our citizenry be part of that discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=624.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, are we planning on doing that before we go to a city council final vote as we move<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=631.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: forward because that's something that was um stressed pretty pretty strongly when we discussed it with the prior city council so uh again i appreciate the hard work but i've been waiting uh to ask this question for the simple fact that it's what was intended when we first started the process so thank you thank you so much Councilor i really appreciate that question um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=775.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor as a city council, I have a question and for you to deny that question for city staff is a serious issue, Madam Vice President, because I have a follow up to the question that you asked because I asked a specific question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=789.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The specific question I asked was when we asked to write the RFP and if I'll bring up the minutes, we will<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=796.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we asked that we were going to take this directly to the neighborhoods and have an open discussion in those neighborhoods with open dialogue and meetings to get everybody's input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=807.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not what you just said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=808.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, this council is working on the transparency factor of what you think is correct, not what we decided on as a council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=818.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So don't disrespect me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=821.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wouldn't do that to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=821.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've done it three times tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=823.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=825.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Look at the video.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=870.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam Vice President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=877.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=878.231s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that it's important as as make it make it to be clear that I've I've gone to listen to every meeting, gone to every meeting, and this is under the meeting preference that we're waiting on the process that was originally planned and the RFP that this will be taking to the communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=897.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You haven't answered that question yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=899.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't talked about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=900.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You said that we've had open dialogue that we've done this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=903.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=904.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I want to make it clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=906.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This Councilor hasn't brought this forward because I've been waiting for the process to walk through to see when is the plan and to go into the neighborhoods because that was the original discussion, Madam Vice President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=917.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=918.579s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=808.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=810.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Larry Lepore,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=813.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: someone we should all celebrate to know and be honored that he was our friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=818.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's been a while since you take that ride down Main Street and you notice his car's gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=826.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At Alexander's, one of his favorite spots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=831.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or the knock on your door and just so he can pat my dog.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=835.512s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or sometimes he would sneak away because he knew Dina was coming with Biscotti.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=844.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he would always be so kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=847.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's what we hear over and over about Larry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=852.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He never let politics get in the way of anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=857.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was just such a good person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=859.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And even if you had a bad day, he'd tell you, he'd lend you that word that you're doing the job that people elected you to do and made you feel that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=874.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: whatever you felt in yourself that it was the right thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=878.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm going to miss him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=882.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm going to miss him so much because I think a lot of us, even though if you didn't know Larry long, it's amazing how you captured his spirit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=895.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even a night like tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=898.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, he'd look at me and we'd make eye contact with some stupid comment I'd make and I'd feel, oh, I owe him something later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=907.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or when someone would come up and they'd say something silly and he'd look at me with this like, are you kidding me type of face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=915.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But he never did it with disrespect or without honor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=919.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was such a good person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=921.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know the cancer that he fought at the end was very tough, very painful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=929.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And my condolences to his family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=936.274s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2400.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have one councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2402.77s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know you said that if this job, from what I gather, if this, if we don't find a resolution, National Grid walks away and there is ramifications, like you said, could you explain that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2418.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If there is a power outage with this piece being, you know, non-functioning that, that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2425.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What part of the community is going to be affected if that's the case?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2460.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so hypothetically, if we don't move forward with this, there's a power outage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2467.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Parts of South Medford are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2485.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So with that situation, does that then facilitate an emergency service?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2490.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2496.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and then, if, Mr. O'Connor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2503.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What do we pay then?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2525.609s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and then the rule is still up for interpretation, still have to hop the car.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2531.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=123.514s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=262.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Before we go on, can I just address my original question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=268.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=271.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Pete, there are questions, um, that I know that, um, there were some questions about council rules, about limitations when it comes to, to, uh, meetings minutes and how long we could speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=283.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if there are follow up questions, and if there's one question, I believe council bears explain the process that we're using.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=290.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, uh, as council president, I think he wants to move this meeting along, but I just, there were some senior citizens that mentioned,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=298.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if there's some confusion, I hope we have a little leeway when it comes to maybe asking the same question twice because of maybe not understanding it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=306.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I hope we would do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=308.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The other question that Councilor Bears did read, did speak about is that we all asked for information to be sent out to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=318.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor's response, I believe,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=322.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The chief of staff did respond that legally the city couldn't inform or given, I'll just read if I can just so people understand, cause it's a little confusing to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=337.859s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sending this information request, so it's, we sent this email to legal on today to guide us on what we can do, should avoid doing before we can assist given the OCPF guidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=350.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One specific question in mind is whether we can intentionally direct notification advertisement to subset of residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=358.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the following is up on my email below, per council, we can't send unsolicited information<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=365.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to all voters or a portion of voters of the city, whether by mail or by email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=374.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We got that, that response was today, correct, Councilor Bears?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=376.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was 10 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=378.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=378.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we knew that and we needed to change wording, I think sending out an all call that we were having a meeting that would, it's open to the public, that just read the resolution, I think that that wouldn't have been an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=392.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just wanted to share that with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=394.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=398.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=404.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council Adam, did you forward this to everybody?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=843.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that the word transparent gets thrown around, Ted, and I hate for you to get dragged into this, but you weren't part of any financial task force for the override, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=856.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I was not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=856.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=859.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Normally, when communities put this into place,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=863.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm told from different communities, different assessors, finance directors, that they usually line this up prior to any budget meetings, so we can help our most vulnerable people in our community understand what any impact it would make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=878.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So having this calculation that you're doing for us, and thank you so much for doing it, because I know there were so many questions with the calculations that have been public on the side that you had nothing to do with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=888.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it came out of a state website, but it didn't truly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=894.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: calculate the newer assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=896.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's correct, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=898.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yep, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=898.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we look at this and now we're doing it on the 11th hour, the question was normally in your experience, other professionals in your field, this is done usually during budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=913.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can prepare our residents that if there was an increase of 373 median price,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=922.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're prepared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=923.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it sounds minimal to some people because it's only, that's all we keep hearing, it's only, but is it odd that we're doing this so late?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=945.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=947.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=950.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any other questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1135.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1136.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With just a couple more questions, I know that you mentioned that this doesn't have any impact on question six, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1143.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not in fiscal year 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1145.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because it's not enough time to put everything in, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1148.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know the actual numbers, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1155.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, but we still don't know how much for question six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1158.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's an open-ended, as it said in the question, there's nothing there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1169.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1170.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I realize the exemptions are great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1173.424s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but I know that there are options when you do this ahead of time is to really prepare your seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1179.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know the exemptions sound good, but when you read them and you talk to actual people, there are a lot of senior citizens that really don't fit in that category.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1187.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there are no other options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1190.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know the buzzwords easy to say, we do have exemptions, but when you put it apples to apples and you sit with the senior citizen and you go through their situation, I'm sure you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1200.171s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mrs. Jones bought her house with her husband 55 years ago for 50,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1204.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now the house is appraised at a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1208.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, it really doesn't help what we're offering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1211.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's a funny number and there could be something done more if we had time for an exemption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1218.621s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1219.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that if we had time, this is something we could petition to see if we can really truly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1224.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: support our senior citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1226.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that must be said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1227.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think the, the last piece to this, I think that when they look at this and because one question I have Ted is that a lot of people have asked, not just seniors, um, that the, this is like a one time tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1240.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1241.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you see that 4% above your two and a half percent increase, that's going to be compounded year after year after year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1249.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't something that's going to go away like debt exclusion, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1257.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, so that'll grow forever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1259.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think the other piece that people have to understand too, and it's a tough office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1264.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just, when you hear the misconceptions, I just need your input to educate our residents and understanding that, again, I believe the mayor said her house is only $13.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1275.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Some others here said their house is $40 a month or whatever, and we can handle that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1281.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That might be the first year, but again, we were told, I think someone from your office emailed us and said that we'll be reassessing again in 2025 for 2026 using the data for 2023, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1310.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1311.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1312.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for helping with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1313.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it increases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1313.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1314.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, when this tax goes in, it's now assessed again, the homes will be assessed again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1323.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, but we're seeing that most assessments, because I could tell you, I'm dealing with my own family members that are looking at a $400 increase per month for his new assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1336.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1337.183s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that what people also have to understand is that it's not just the home tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1342.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've seen their cars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1347.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Motor vehicle excise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1348.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Vehicle excise tax is going to go up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1350.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're going to see the CPA tax because your homes are going to be assessed higher now, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1354.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now the CPA tax will also be taxed higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1357.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're going to see that a little bit higher, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1360.18s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, that's yeah, that's generally correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1366.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1367.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what you're seeing is, it's not just it's not just an override tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1374.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's an override tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1375.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's compounded year after year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1377.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a tax that increases in the CPA as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1380.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the excise tax that increases as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1383.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's so much more than just 13.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1385.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's my point I'm trying to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1387.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's easy to look at a site that wasn't put forth by our office because we know that although it's correct, the numbers that my colleagues did put out there on a page, it does give the numbers that are true and factual, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1403.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That didn't include the assessments that residents had, and I'll use my brother's example, because his house was appraised at, on the calculations, at $800,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1413.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: His house is now appraised at $1.2 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1415.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's why we're seeing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1417.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's not odd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1419.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is family-owned homes that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1422.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we passed on to generation to generation, just like most people in this room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1426.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1427.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know I'm monopolizing the time because I think it's important, because these are the questions the people that are sitting in this in this room right now and their friends have contacted me and said, we're very confused, Mr. Scappelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1438.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because even something simple as, Mr. Scarpelli, why are we fighting for $7.5 million for a new high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1445.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm like, no, no, this has nothing to do with the new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1447.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1448.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And people understanding that, well, this is a fight between schools and kids and senior citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1455.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not true at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1456.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just want to make sure all the information's out so every resident understands the impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1462.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that, and we could talk about solutions as we go, because there are solutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1466.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were solutions back in April, but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1593.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is the microphone on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1597.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Andrew, is the mic, turn the mic down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2045.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let me start off by first saying that unfortunately this administration has divided this community for the children in the schools and the seniors or the homeowners or renters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2057.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I say shame on this administration, shame on this council, shame on the financial task force, because the bottom line is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2065.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This group knew that we were heading in some tough waters back in June 20th of 2023.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2072.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you could see that in a city council budget meeting when council beers met with the mayor behind closed doors to set up some sort of deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2081.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't know what that deal was, but they created a financial task force and that financial task force put together a plan of an override without anybody's knowledge, anybody's input or any,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2094.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or any community participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2097.747s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are no issues with our school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2101.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a fair tactic and fair tactic only for the fact that we should remember this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2107.29s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Back in April, back in May, back in June, when the city had $25 million in free cash, it was my responsibility to bring forth that we take that $5 million<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2119.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: levy that budget, make sure there were no cuts, understand the process, and then move forward to see if we truly need an override, which I never said that should never be an option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2130.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But to hear parents and teachers and friends and family say, George, explain this to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2138.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Villes knew that this was gonna be a devastating situation, but it could have been solved and still could be solved with free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2147.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have plenty of free cash in the system not to turn the city upside down or divide the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2153.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, remember, I'll leave you with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2156.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're asking for in the budget<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2159.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in this override doesn't mean you'll get exactly what you think you're gonna get.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2165.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because all these cuts were made to set up this override as a fair tactic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2169.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2169.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2170.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli is not against the children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2173.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just hope that people understand that this could be soft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2178.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2530.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2532.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think I heard some similar situations with, I know what the assessor came up and gave us medium price homes, but we're seeing real people have told me that this is what we're seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2544.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're seeing the increase close to $60,000, most homes that you're seeing an increase at a higher percentage rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2551.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, on top of all of what we talked about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2554.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with this, so it's not the $13 a month, the $40 a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2557.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the pieces that this gentleman just said is the understanding that I never thought that our home insurance now will now increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2568.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, this isn't them against us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2572.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is understanding that we have viable options right now to fix this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2579.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with free cash and then work together to see how we can have an open process to really include all the stakeholders to make sure that, uh, that no one is hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2590.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2917.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2918.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, I think my council is not understanding the free cash should be used now to fix a problem now, which we have, and I appreciate the clarification it's only $3 million accounts accounting and just said to fix the school budget, but the key issue isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2933.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: isn't the process of getting this fixed now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2936.745s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The problem that we've had, and we could use the pandemic and use the pandemic over and over again, but what neighboring communities are doing during the pandemic with the infrastructure money that was given through ARPA, that wasn't intended for, for the roads and sidewalks that you're asking for right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2951.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our mayor didn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2952.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our mayor had to balance our budget through ESSER and ARPA funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2957.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the easy way out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2958.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's like paying your mortgage with a credit card.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2961.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll tell you why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2962.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2963.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody hasn't said it, but the difference between why we're here and we're in trouble is because of new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2970.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: New growth is what pushes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2973.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: our value, our income up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2975.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It gives us more tax base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2977.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It brings more money so we can do all the things we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2980.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This mayor has done nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2982.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't had shovel in the ground in five and a half years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2985.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're talking about, I know my council friends have gone out and told people that Massachusetts is the number one, Medford is the number one community new growth in permitting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2995.47s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Wrong, I sat with the commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2997.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Permitting their fine, the biggest concerns we're having, look at the process that she lost fighting 40B projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3005.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One project alone was $3 to $5 million in permits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3010.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then an additional $7 to $9 million that would have come in as new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3015.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one job that she fought in court, lost and appealed it, and this group had to leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3021.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The problem isn't our tax base, because our assessments are up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3025.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're paying more than anybody else in neighboring communities because our assessments are so high.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3031.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will share my last point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3034.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Neighbor communities per child, Malden, Arlington, Winchester, between 15 and 17,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3042.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Medford, we pay $22,000 per student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3045.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it a management issue or is it really we don't have enough money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3049.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Think about it because it's public. $22,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3530.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I can, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3532.456s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3532.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, this financial task force was put together without any individual involved in that comment that a young lady put forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3542.981s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This was done in a bubble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3544.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This was done behind closed doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3546.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It wasn't planned to educate our seniors, educate our residents, educate our renters, educate our landlords, so they could prepare themselves for what's being asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3557.048s">[Scarpelli]</a>: within a vote that was presented, a discussion was presented on a Thursday, voted on a Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3564.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: not one community meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3565.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as a matter of fact, I will share this with everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3569.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was a FOIA request put out by a resident that asked a simple question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3575.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They asked for all of the information, minutes for the meetings, any information, letters, any emails, any text messages, with this financial task force, with any building or any entity within the city to figure out if this is needed or how it will be used and how it can work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3593.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 150 pages later, all the information that was in that FOIA request were information about when we can meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3600.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing that's solid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3602.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would also share with these parents that are so concerned about what's happening, we were<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3608.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: saw the information back from the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3612.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The school department communications director answered by saying, thank you for the FOIA request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3617.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We apologize for the tardy response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3620.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But after investigating, there was no school department employee or member of the school department involved in any financial task force<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3630.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: dealing with these overrides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3631.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what again, what we're saying is we don't know if an override is needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3636.331s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know one thing, we know we could fix this issue right now with free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3641.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So our students and teachers and families are fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3644.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we go back to the drawing board as a community together to see what we really need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3650.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If the mayor isn't gonna put new growth out there, she's not gonna work to bring in creatively, bring in funding for the city, then maybe we can look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4026.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Financial director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4203.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure, let me help you, Mr. Jones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4206.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This financial task force was a farce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4208.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was a lack of transparency throughout.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4211.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you speak on, I speak to this in where I worked in 2009.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4216.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we met in a possible override in a neighboring community, we talked about three things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4221.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was how do we get here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4223.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What do we do to fix it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4224.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And how does this happen again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4226.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And those people brought in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4228.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: mines from Tufts, Harvard, MIT, Medford, not one person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4233.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They brought in their financial team, Medford, not one person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4237.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They had their assessor set the rate so people can understand, assessor was never involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4241.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you look at how this was done, this was done in a bubble, this was presented on a Thursday, and then voted for in the budget meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4249.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you look at the budget meetings, when I brought up the way to fix it, which is free cash, and I'll disagree with my fellow Councilor, because she's wrong 1,000%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4261.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Free cash for divisional local services, it's not recommended, but not against the law to use free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4269.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 3 to 5% annual budget, FY24 method generated $9 million to add to a $25 million estimate, which means the city had around 16% of free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4281.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, the solution was very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4284.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's have this financial task force present this to the community, because that's what I asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4289.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I asked my colleagues, when are we going to present what the findings were?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4293.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were no findings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4294.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was just given, we're going to do an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4296.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People came up, shared, the mayor was happy, and it was done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4299.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The truth of the matter is, you're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4302.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was no one involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4304.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This was done in a bubble to scare people, to come out and say, the schools, the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4310.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll say it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4311.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said this in April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4312.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said it in May.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4312.714s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll say it today again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4314.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We might need an override, but if we do it right, with open and transparent government, we could do something great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4321.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now remember, with one override in every other community, there's two, three to follow, and don't forget, this council's gonna ask for a 200 to $400 million debt exclusion from New High School, which we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4332.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4334.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please don't be confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4336.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not telling you the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4337.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4339.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4854.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Another fair tactic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4855.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So people should understand the mayor came out just the other day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4858.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had 34 million, 34.5 million as of July 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4863.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor, just so you know, what free cash is, it's your money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4866.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we say we're going to fund 50 teachers and we don't pay those 50 teachers because they don't hire them, that money goes into free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4875.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's our money, that's your tax money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4877.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and then it could be used for what it needs to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4879.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's truly mismanagement of funds from our leadership team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4884.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's taking what we sign off on our budget and not use correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4889.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what we have right now, I believe I've said this, Councilor Leming said it over and over again, I'm not saying use free cash every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4897.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a deficit right now, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4900.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we can correct right now and not put the schools and kids and teachers in fear and say let's level fund that budget using one time free cash one time and then look into what options we have later but let's listen to the mayor what she said 34.5 million<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4916.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now she knows the override's gonna be a fight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4918.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What does she do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4919.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Boom, she starts putting all these different monies in different accounts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4923.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So from her words exactly in her video the other day, we have 18.5 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4928.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With that said, we can still take funding to level the school budget and still have 14, $15 million, which still leaves enough in there that would appease any bond rating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4940.553s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, let's not get scared because that's a scare tactic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4944.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's see the bond rating so we can move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4946.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, when we look at this situation, council, different communities, free cash, Arlington is 18 million, Framingham 14 million, bigger budget, Quincy 1.2 million, bigger budget, Andover 14 million, Newton, these communities are bigger than ours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4964.739s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have this budget, they function with lower funding and free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4971.183s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So understand this, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4972.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can do this one-time cost to save the fare from our schools, take care of our seniors, our renters, our homeowners, so we can stop the fare in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4982.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please, vote no on these overrides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4987.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was done in a bubble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4988.613s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It wasn't transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5219.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's 18.5 left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5226.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's called scare tactics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5438.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, Mr. Giglio, these are all scare tactics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5443.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, the financial task force didn't have the FOIA requests that shows that there were no documentations, no minutes, no information given.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5453.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We heard the assessor, we know all the major parties, the school department, the assessor, the finance director, weren't involved in these issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5462.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is, it's not a lie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5464.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just said it, you heard it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5466.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Put 30 seconds back on for interrupting me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5468.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have the understanding that the sky is falling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5474.177s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All of these projects that we need to fix, we need to fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5477.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In normal communities, what we do is we bond these projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5481.079s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we look at situations that we talked about earlier, when it's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5486.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're trying, what we're seeing here right now, Mr. Joyo, it's the underfunding of local revenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5496.209s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One second, I'll just, it's the focus of what we're seeing that our community has done for years here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5502.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's show lower meals tax and hotel tax and excise tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5507.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So then when it comes higher, you can put that and use it for whatever you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5511.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let that be known, the understanding what you're asking for, there are no numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5515.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The problem we hear right now, why the city's divided, why our seniors are scared, why our landlords are scared, why our homeowners and renters are afraid right now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5523.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why our students and parents and teachers are afraid is because this group did something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5529.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They put it out there without any true information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5531.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we don't know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5533.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't been educated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5534.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why there's so much fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5536.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The firefighters aren't supporting a $30 million fire station, because again, there was no transparency there when it came to the final decision that had to be made for 30.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5544.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they've decided to go public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5546.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They decided to go public to say, let's not hurt our taxpayers with whatever, how many it's going to be, because we don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5553.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It could be a $50 million fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5555.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the design was never put forth to the firefighters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5559.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you say totality, six, seven, and eight, we haven't been involved, Mr. Gileo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5564.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are no numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5565.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There is no information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5566.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because this group did it in the financial task force that presented it on a Thursday, voted on it on a Tuesday, and then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5574.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We find $9 million in free cash after that, that the man knew was certified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5583.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, can I say one more thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5685.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We wouldn't know that because it's literally in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6037.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With the fair tactics, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6038.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the schools, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6041.33s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's Councilor Leming said it over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6044.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, we haven't done it, so let's do it, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6047.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just because we haven't done it, let's do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6049.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now the roads, now we hear the schools were built bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6054.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's all fair, this is all fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6056.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But here's the thing, we're not saying that, let's not look at this properly and do it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6064.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6065.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're doing it in a bubble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6067.051s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're doing it so privately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6068.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're doing it where it's gonna hurt so many people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6072.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, the finger-pointing between teachers and finger-pointing between seniors and kids, and it's a shame what you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6082.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can correct this right now with the free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6085.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No matter what they say, the truth of the matter is we have free cash to make sure that seven and eight are correctable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6092.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know question six is correctable by listening to our firefighters, who will tell you straightforward that the mayor's not telling the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6102.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What they're building there is insufficient, and it's going to put us 30 years behind in five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6108.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please understand this, Mr. Gervino, when you say all this information and how it gets out, we haven't done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6114.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even though councils want to say we did, we haven't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6117.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't prepared our seniors for what's going to happen on January 1st of 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6122.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Once the new assessment, once the new tax bills come out, we haven't done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6126.289s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't prepared up our, our, our landlords to how they're going to handle single parent, uh, renters in their home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6132.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't prepared our renters when increase goes up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6135.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here's another one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6136.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Somebody called me when I put a post out about a woman that called me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6140.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She has two children, and the landlord said, I'm not going to hit you with the assessment raise, but I'm going to be honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6147.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I got to tell you, I'm going to have to raise your rent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6151.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And someone asked me, well, are you going to support rent control?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6154.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, there's another wrong that doesn't make a right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6157.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, there's a system in place with this group that's telling you what you should do out of fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6163.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please, again, we have the funds to fix it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6167.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No matter what they're saying, it's absolutely above board to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6172.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand it was done with mismanagement throughout the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6177.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6514.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6524.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It goes into general fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6527.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6528.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It goes into general fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6529.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And by law, you're supposed to take the letter of what the questions are and use those funding as closely as you can to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6538.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the questions as they're read are very vague.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6542.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it really doesn't mean it's gonna go directly to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6546.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It could be portions of that or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6548.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I'll bring us back to the budget meeting when school committee member Jenny Graham was asked a question, if we were given $5 million, would everybody go back to those positions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6559.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the answer was yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6561.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The next evening, the school's financial director and the school superintendent, when I asked that question from the evening before, she said, absolutely not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6571.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The money would go back into their fund and they would distribute it to what they think is best for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6577.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's a little, it's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6580.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll give you an example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6581.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talk about all these different cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6583.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't filled, I believe now 29 teachers in the Medford public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6589.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's funding we haven't, we paid for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6591.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have so many dire issues, so many, the fiscal crisis we've been hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6597.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same breath, we're asking to bring in shiny new programs that are new, that are costing the school department $200,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6606.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're talking about a city council that during this financial crisis talked about, did what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6612.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We found $9 million of free cash when they looked at the override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6616.035s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6617.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They voted themselves a raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6619.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the SIKU committee now goes from $10,000 to $12,000 up to $22,000, $24,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6626.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor gets an increase three times, three different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6630.436s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I implore all of you who are open-minded thinkers, are you sure we're in a fiscal crisis or are we in a problem with this fiscal mismanagement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6726.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6951.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Councilor Bielsa, in question six, I think we have a firefighters union here that have been involved in the negotiation because there is no limit on question six, truly is no limit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6962.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6964.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, there isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6965.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's wide open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6965.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that if we can maybe have a fire fighters that have been working on this, just to give us an idea of what the process was, the beginning, what we were looking at for a number and how, how much it's dropped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6978.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can understand truly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6984.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6985.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm sorry, hopefully the firefighters can have an opportunity to express why they want to vote no on this debt exclusion because I think what you asked, there is such fluctuation and what's true, what they needed and what was agreed upon<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7003.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: before the mayor became very angry with the firefighters and then started cutting and cutting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7008.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now we're left with an inferior product that our firemen and women, firefighter men and women said over and over again, that please do not hurt the residents of this community with an inferior station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7020.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Don't do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7021.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Wait, maybe down the line, we could rethink this and refocus on what we could do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7025.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But for now, we're saying, let's not hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7028.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So here we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7028.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have teachers that are saying, let's not hurt our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7031.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have firefighters saying, let's not hurt the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7034.929s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The questions you're asking should have been out there for you, Joan, months and months ago, so you could truly understand the impact that you're going to feel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7043.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, this is where we talk about the lack of transparency and why this should be taken off the table and people should vote no, because the bottom line is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7053.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The fear of children, that should be fixed with the $3 million from free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7057.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor said it, we have 18.5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7059.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We could still take 3 million out and do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7061.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll still have enough to keep our bond rating up and look to bond other projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7066.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or maybe we sit together again as a true financial working group, a task force, and say, how do we do this together as a community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7074.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're not gonna look later because there's no guarantees that there won't be another override next year, I promise you that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7080.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because every other community that's gone that way have asked for two and three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7626.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7629.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Isn't this a total microcosm of what we're saying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7633.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what 678 is about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7635.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's so much confusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7638.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First of all, we have to understand the feasibility study that was done is what gets us the funding for through procurement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7645.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we know the numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7647.11s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When my fellow council said that this is a city building and firefighters, I don't know what the comment was, that is so irresponsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7654.437s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To understand that this fire department's gonna stand up and say, no, we don't want a new headquarters because it's insufficient and it will hurt our community funding-wise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7665.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we say the needs of the community, we mean proper safe staffing and department and ability to add technical rescue specialist services to our emergency response, which will bring better services to the citizens in every call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7678.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's wrong what they're asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7679.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're asking for a fire stations adequate to help our community grow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7685.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The proposed design does not adequately address the health and safety issues of the fire service regarding cancer exposure mitigations, the privacy concerns which have never been addressed properly by our department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7697.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Adults deserve privacy regardless of the gender.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7700.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't an issue which is female and men.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7703.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you understand the design that was presented has firefighters after a fire showering downstairs<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7709.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: walking upstairs in a towel or a bathrobe, walking down a community hallway to get to their quarters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7716.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: By the way, their quarters did not consist of a locker room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7721.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what we're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7722.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are issues that I can't even believe that we would entertain this with so many questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7728.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is how six, seven, and eight were all done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7730.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They were all done in a bubble that we're supposedly battled over on social media by a leader of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7739.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have the former fire chief here, we have the leaders of our fire department that have openly said, we don't want to hurt our citizenry and putting $30 million, let alone $3 into this because we don't know what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8151.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate my fellow Councilor being in my mind to understand what my plan was, was to get the superintendent to say something she didn't wanna say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8162.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I appreciate the resident who put all of the meetings out on social media because you could say whatever you want about George Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8174.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You could say that he's a liar, but when there are video and documentations with it, simple question to the superintendent was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8182.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Will this money, will it be made whole like Councilor, School Committee Woman Graham mentioned?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8187.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Her simple answer was no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8189.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wasn't trying to have her say anything any different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8191.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as a matter of fact, what we're seeing in the school system after that vote, there were many teachers and many programs that were dismissed and cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8200.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had the band leader who left right away because there were promised things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8204.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had, we had to believe a $200,000 line put in place for City Year, which is a great program,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8210.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a great program, but when you have so many fiscal crises in the city, why are we funding something that's just a shiny nickel right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8217.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many issues with this, my friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8220.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I implore you just to listen to the common sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8224.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Listen to the understanding that you can use free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8227.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a former teacher, and a parent of public school kids, and a coach, I understand, I lived it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8235.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I lived the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8237.981s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but I also understand and how to move forward without hurting our whole community or without dividing our whole community, because this is what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8247.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These override questions are hurting our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8250.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have the information that's out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8253.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not spelled out correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8255.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't truly know, although like Councilor Kelly had said, yeah, it goes to the general fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8260.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know where that money's going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8263.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have teachers positions open with money in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8265.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Remember, there's a lot of money that hasn't been used to date that we can still use, but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8537.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, we went over this again, just to reiterate to people that are new to the room, $37, that's all it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8544.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Coming from people that truly don't understand the impact, because a lot of people here, imagine just $37 a month, what that would do to people sitting in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8552.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Imagine the impact, because that's been overlooked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8555.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but it's not 37.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8556.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about the CPA increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8558.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about the assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8560.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about the excise tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8562.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8563.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not 37.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8563.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The dialogue of fear spins it easily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8567.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, again, I'm gonna say this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8569.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The dialogue of fear, we talked about busing now, lead in the water, teacher cuts, roads and sidewalks, because $500,000 is gonna fix road and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8580.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the most important thing I wanna talk about is what's happening in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8584.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if you watch what's happening in social media, the teachers union, the MTA, has never ever, as one person that was on the negotiating team and a former member, has never ever<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8599.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: ruled on or endorsed a candidate or a question, because we knew as union members that our impact's not gonna hurt just, it's not gonna help us, but it's gonna hurt other unions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8611.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they did the right thing by staying neutral.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8616.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And maybe they believe in it, maybe they don't, but they said, let's be, let's stay neutral.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8620.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And shame on this community that have turned their backs on teachers saying, the comments I've been seeing, like this is the teacher's fault?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8628.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't the teacher's fault, this is the administration's fault to set up this fear tactic and set up this negativity to divide us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8636.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's dividing our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8639.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Listen, I want everything we can get for our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8642.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want everything we need for our students and parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8646.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want everything we need for our firefighters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8649.52s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there's options with new growth as we come down the line, but we can correct it right now without hurting renters, landlords, senior citizens, our people that are most vulnerable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8659.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can use that free cash, make it whole and move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8665.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I implore you, please, think about what you've been hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8669.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's concrete, common sense information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8672.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9184.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, Councilor, to clarify a little something, I think that what I've heard from residents is the chronic misrepresentation and the lack of true transparency<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9198.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is what causes the community to distrust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9203.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what we're seeing right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9205.304s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's truly what we're seeing right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9207.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you hear and see how we got to this point, this is what caused it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9214.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The misinformation, the confusion, the uncertainty for the people that are most vulnerable, our children, our seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9226.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the issue that we should be focusing on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9229.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and thinking that an override is the answer, or, ready for this one, $500,000 are gonna fix our streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9237.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Come on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9239.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So let's look at, now I've heard that 20 times tonight, that $500,000 is gonna fix our streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9244.514s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's look at the big picture of what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9246.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: DPW, the mayor is firing DPW workers hand over fist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9252.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have equipment at DPW that we have members that haven't been trained because they don't know how to be trained on new equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9261.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a mayor that's spending so much money on legal fees and legal settlements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9269.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're using, the mismanagement of funds in this community has hurt us to the point that here we are, that some council is saying, hey, since we haven't done it ever, let's do it, which is wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9283.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I'd love to see us do this the right way from the schools with free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9290.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's go to the table and see what we truly need with a true financial team open to the public that it's shared with everybody's input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9299.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9456.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't understand her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9457.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't hear her question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9466.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, it's very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9467.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll say it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9468.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that when we sat and talked at the meeting in April, May, and June, I came forth with the proposal of a resolution of using free cash of the $25 million that we had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9483.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe it was Councilor, when I brought it forth, it was Councilor Leming that used Rule 21, which froze<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9491.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the future discussions of that proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9494.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then as it went through and you could see in the videos, as we went through that process, they kept using tactics where we couldn't speak or have open forums before we went to a vote in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9506.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, these are issues that when I say<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9511.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what we need to eliminate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9512.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to sit together as a community and say, okay, what do we work with the state and work with our assessor and say, hey, let's understand the impact at an early enough stage so we can be prepared for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9524.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's see if we can look at true exemptions that would help our landlords or senior citizens<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9529.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or our most vulnerable community members, then let's look at it and say, what do we really need and make sure that our children in our schools have everything that they're asking for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9539.373s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that with that process being open, I don't think we wouldn't be able to deny anything, but the way the process has come out and the way that's been spun saying, Councilor Scarpelling wants no because he doesn't want that, that's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9555.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The truth of the matter is the way this process has gone about from 2023 in June till today has been a total farce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9563.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's been a nightmare.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9564.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's been disingenuine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9566.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this council can say what they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9568.839s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These fair tactics are out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9570.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've heard them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9571.52s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not making it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9572.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've heard them all say it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9574.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: whether it's whether it's whether it's streets falling in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9578.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, even the mayor said the other day was sitting on a 200 million dollar time bomb called our water system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9584.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9585.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, if we did our job with ARPA, that's what that money was made for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9590.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not to save your key, sir, because you had no new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9593.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10069.855s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let me say it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10070.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10071.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This councilor has not said once that we should use free cash year after year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10076.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I said right now is eliminate the fear for our senior citizens, our children, our teachers for one time to level fund this and look at other options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10087.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what I said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10087.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know where this keeps coming back and forth and understand an override<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10094.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was said by another financial director in another community, he said to me, George, remember, using an override to do what you're trying to do in Medford, it's like using your credit card to pay for your mortgage or pay for your rent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10105.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's just not feasible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10107.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not a right way to go through the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10109.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We look at the different situations that we talk about and we said, okay, you know, Medford has drastically underfunded so many processes when you look at our receipts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10122.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're seeing that right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10123.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We see that our circuit breaker has increased.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10128.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've seen that we use the Fair Amendment Act for Chapter 70, our increase of $4 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10136.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There is a lot that's out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10138.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a lot of money in the city that we're not using correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10144.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have seen it over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10145.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've talked about, just to have the fact that you have $9 million of free cash at the end of the year, your budget season, to get certified, that just speaks volumes of mismanagement of fiscal funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10159.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Remember, when you sit there and you set that budget, that budget is set, let's say 100 million, and then you only spend 90 million, that means you didn't do something right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10173.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That means you didn't use that money appropriately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10176.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the city's taxpayers' money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10180.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when I say free cash, of course it's not free.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10183.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's our money that we've already paid the year before to balance our budget, to make our city run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10226.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Simon, thank you for coming up tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10229.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm so impressed with you coming to this podium, because there are so many scaredy cat adults, but you have the guts to come up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10235.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I applaud you for that, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10237.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I have family members that might be your teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10241.575s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have children that went through the schools just like you did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10245.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know it's scary right now, because you're listening to grownups talk about, we're gonna cut positions, we're gonna hurt teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10252.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not the intent, my friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10254.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a solution that's easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10257.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can use money that the city has saved, that can fix it right now, instead of going to a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10263.096s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's something that Mr. Scarpelli asked for years, months and months ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10267.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when you come to this point, my friend, you have to understand, we wanna make sure that every single one of your teachers are back next year, because you know why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10276.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You deserve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10278.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for coming up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10950.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10952.01s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To your point, Mr. Rodriguez, I think that this is why question eight, again, this is why these questions are so vague, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10959.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That people are confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10960.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because the determination of this $4 million is so we can align the vocational school building with the high school building so we can increase the day, so we can provide programming for both levels, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10974.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So here's something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10977.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It hasn't been negotiated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10978.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It hasn't been discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10980.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So where is the money gonna go when it's not even entertained?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10986.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are the questions people have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10988.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The question that's $4 million, the state expert and former superintendent of Medford, Roy Belson, stated, if during negotiations, that's what we're looking for is to line those bells, then it's negotiations for the high school and vocational school teachers to increase their rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11013.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Realistically, you're looking at $600,000 when you're looking to do that group, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11018.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $4 million for what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11021.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like we've said, more arts programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11024.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have art programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11026.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The issue is aligning the bell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11028.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In programming, we have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11029.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just gotta line the bell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11032.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, it's so wide open to say $4 million to do arts and to align this process with the vocational school and the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11042.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is so vague, how can we even entertain voting on it when we know the ramifications to the rest of the community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11051.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11055.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: hear what was being said tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11057.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many open-ended questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11059.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many issues that people don't know how we got here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11063.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have FOIA requests that show that there was no proper discussions with school department members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11069.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When the school department isn't part of this financial task force for an override, and then a question like question eight comes up, it's so vague.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11077.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we sure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11078.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we sure that we need an override?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11184.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Where does it say that though?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11185.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because that's eloquent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11187.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You would have to look at it if it was presented that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11190.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, it wasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11191.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11192.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11737.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11741.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11743.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I missed most of the question, Bill, but again, like we're saying, we're hearing a systemic issue that's been happening for years, but the way the process, and I'll say again, the way the process has come forth, the way the process has come full circle right now, it's putting so many people, so many residents in flux and fear, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11765.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's the biggest concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11767.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the way that we've moved forward, that this group has moved forward to present an out, that really isn't an out like they've said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11776.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not gonna really help, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11779.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know where the money's going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11780.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Things are still questioned for each question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11783.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not certainties, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11786.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've already heard from everybody that hasn't been part of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11790.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, why continue this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11794.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why keep moving forward and understanding that we're hurting real people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11797.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're hurting real residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11800.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I said, I like, again, I'm talking about the children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11803.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm talking about the seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11804.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm talking about our renters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11805.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm talking about our homeowners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11807.692s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're hurting a lot of people right now for something that quote unquote is so minimal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11814.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the truth of the matter is, this is so minimal and such cause such divide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11819.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're now seeing is, are we truly gonna look at the next question when we really need it properly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11825.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or are we gonna look at it with caution and saying, I'm definitely gonna stand against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11833.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll use a $200 million, $400 million high school down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11838.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Imagine if that process was done, how it would destroy homeowners right now, senior citizens, people on fixed incomes, it would destroy us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11847.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why this process has to be done in a better way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11849.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It shouldn't be done in a vacuum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11852.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11926.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I think if I can, Mr. President, I think when we've heard parents of the fear, right, that we're going to cut, I believe one school can remember saying it was 55 to 65 teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11938.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then it was now 35 and the pain, the fear is going to be spread all over, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11945.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody's going to feel the pain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11947.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was the comment that's gone out publicly by that school committee remember.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11950.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11951.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think what you're saying to this is saying that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11955.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we gonna cut, a teacher's gonna be cut in January, January 2025, if the override fails in November?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11963.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a question, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11964.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11966.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know because in these questions, these override questions, you didn't say to cover the cost of 55 to 65 teachers that will be cut, not a question seven or question eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11977.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11979.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that again leads to another example of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11985.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we sure we know what we're voting on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11987.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And are we sure we need to move forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11991.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And was this transparent enough?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12003.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So clarity, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12004.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So clarity, everyone, where's Simon?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12007.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Your teachers aren't going to be cut this year, because that's the word going out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12011.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The word was at these meetings now, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12013.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They will not be cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12013.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There'll be no cuts until next fiscal year, next school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12017.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But next fiscal year, we'll have more money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12018.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Next school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12019.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12020.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It'll give us time, because we had an opportunity, Gaston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12023.539s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had an opportunity back in 2023, when we realized that we were using ARPA and ESSER funding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12031.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to balance a budget of operations which you shouldn't that we know that but this council voted on a backroom deal that that's what happened and then they've moved forward with this financial task force so here we are right now<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12042.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 1.7 so all right so this is where we are right now<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12047.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh I apologize... so this is... Thank you, I apologize<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12716.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12717.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First, let's start off by the teachers and compensation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12720.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A good way to make sure they go is scare them with layoffs<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12726.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when you have an avenue to save them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12729.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But with this question, the truth of the matter is, in most communities, it's growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12734.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Growth, growth, growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12736.096s">[Scarpelli]</a>: New growth, smart development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12737.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12739.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what happened in neighboring communities like Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12741.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: During the pandemic, what happened in Everett, what happened in Malden, you saw new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12747.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've heard my council colleagues say that it'll take us five to seven years to see that wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12751.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had three 40B projects that not only would bring in valuable funding through permits and fees, and then the new tax base, but also open up an opportunity for what we lack here is affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12768.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this mayor has voided that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12770.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So like I said, just one project, and I'll say it over and over again, because we've talked to the owner of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12776.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He put in a place for 40B projects, 400 units at the old gold gym site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12781.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $3 to $5 million just in permits would have come right to us, right away, $3 to $5 million for one project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12787.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then you would see an increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12789.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Once that's built, you would then have a tax base of more to $6 to $9 million coming in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12797.115s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now what you saw is the mayor fight that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12800.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: which is a 40B project, which you can't fight and win in court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12803.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know that by law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12804.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She takes it to court, they lost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12806.169s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then she brings it back and she appeals it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12810.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: While we're paying lawyers, we lose the appeal, but at the same time, we now have these developers that have walked away to Medford because now they're in Watertown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12819.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now they're in other neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12821.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this gentleman just lost $5 million by sitting on a property, hoping he could develop Medford the right way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12827.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The other piece we have right now, the mayor is, did everybody hear this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12830.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's an RFP for five spots in Method Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12834.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What's the plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12836.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12837.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is again, lack of transparency and openness in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12840.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13095.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, if I can, I think there's more involved here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13101.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that it's very clear and cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13103.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the communities can see that our firemen and women do not want this override or this debt exclusion because it hurts our citizenry because the design and the building that they're looking to build is not adequate for any of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13117.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We also have a firefighter standing in front of us that, so we all understand why we're in fiscal crisis, why we're in fiscal issues, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13127.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Firefighter Masolino wrote a grant for 11 firefighters<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13131.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: through FEMA, so the FEMA would pay these 11 firefighters for three years, as long as you didn't vary from those 11 firefighters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13142.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor came in and said, at the end, the only caveat is you have to sustain those 11 firefighters to be at minimal level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13150.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor came in and said, no, we'll only fund five or seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13154.247s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just by doing that, guess what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13156.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It voided the 11 firefighters that would have been paid for FEMA for three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13162.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, this council, the mayor had a outside member doing evaluation to come in, and we spent $10,000 to start with this firefighter evaluator to come in and look at the fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13177.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have yet to hear anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13179.272s">[Scarpelli]</a>: From what I hear, that person's been gone now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13181.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No report, no nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13183.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the problem we see, the mismanagement of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13186.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not that we don't have, in certain cases, enough funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13190.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's how you manage those funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13192.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I thank you for everything you do, and we should not vote support this override, because our firefighters are saying, let's not hurt our residents, especially if it's an inferior product.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13206.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll stay where we are, even though it's disgusting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13210.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14012.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, and I appreciate the question because I too have a stance on this and it's difficult when your kids are reading posts and saying, hey dad, why are they using you for supporting constituents and residents that feel like they're being not listened to, to racist or a member of KKK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14034.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's pretty sad, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14036.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you see these situations of division,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14039.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's because people feel they haven't been heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14043.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I welcome you to look at the videos from our meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14046.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had viable questions in our meetings, and this is where the division started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14050.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you try to bring these questions forward and this council actively shut you down, as a member of this community and a city councilor, to be disrespected like that, opened up so many people's eyes to say, is this something that's been, is it needed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14067.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because there's a group of people, my friend, that aren't being heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14071.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're afraid that no one's listening to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14075.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something that could be corrected, I've said this a thousand times, I never said I didn't want a debt exclusion, or the side, even the All-Method group saying that they didn't want a debt exclusion, all they're saying is, let's have a more open and transparent process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14087.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've heard so many questionable issues tonight, from the firefighters' designs, to question seven and eight, there's so many.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14094.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think the problem right now is you have six councils that really look at something and an issue and they band together, but they leave a whole demographic out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14102.917s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They can say the fluffy words to say that, well, it's divisive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14106.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're saying it's divisive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14107.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Words that some people use is divisive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14109.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The bottom line is if it's smell, if it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck, it's a duck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14114.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and people just watch and see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14116.705s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want division either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14118.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's too much division in this whole country, in this whole world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14121.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would love for us to sit together, but as a councilor, when you're trying to share an opinion for a group of constituents that feel that they're not being listened to, that they feel like they're not being listened to, then you bring that forward, and then they actively shut you down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14137.651s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They use council rules against you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14139.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They suspend council rules so you can't speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14142.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14144.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is why the division started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14146.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because people didn't feel like they were properly listened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14149.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They didn't feel like this financial task force was actually transparent and open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14152.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if they were, and the mayor presented all the facts, maybe we'd be in a different place right now, but we're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14160.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we made a lot of mistakes on many sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14989.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that when you left, no one could say this publicly, but we wanna thank you because we know how difficult your job is anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14995.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We understand becoming a chief is very difficult because you have been thrown into the realm of politics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15001.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's sad because I know who you are as a man and I know how much you love being a firefighter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15006.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'll be honest with you, I was sad to hear that you did step away because Medford is worse as a fire department because you're gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15014.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I wanna make sure publicly somebody said that to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15016.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know Danielle doesn't want to say it, but I've heard it over and over again through public, through social media, our leader of the community, through social media, bashing on you, bashing on other fire chiefs, saying it's all them, that they've been part of the design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15032.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I need to know, when you left, were our firefighters involved in that design that we have today?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15340.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15341.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, if I can, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15346.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Clarification, thank you with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15347.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I also know that from what I've heard, it's 1,000 square feet smaller.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15352.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think you want to talk about unity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15354.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You want to talk about doing something correct as a team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15356.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you're talking about firefighters, that their safety with carcinogens aren't being met, I think in unity, we should all say that we do not support this debt exclusion for a fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15367.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's inadequate for our men and women in the fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15370.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what I think we should say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15372.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You want to start in that process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15374.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15375.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But Chief, thank you so much for the clarity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15377.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I apologize that our firefighters aren't being heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16519.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if I can, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16521.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So very simply put is, I've been saying this for months now, is that it's a one-time correction with the free cash to eliminate any fear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16532.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and disruption to our whole community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16536.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been saying for years that in the last five years, we've had zero new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16542.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you talk about new growth, that is the solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16546.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The solution to any community's investment in finances is their new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16552.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done nothing in the city of Medford to hang our hats on other than a beer hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16560.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't seen anything bring in true funding other than a beer haul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16566.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, I mean, I've been pretty consistent with what I've been saying, but although you don't wanna look at transparency, I think that's the major issue right now is because the word, the information is not getting out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16579.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're voting on something that we've shown so many different reasons why we shouldn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16585.088s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many open questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16586.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many people, actual people that are gonna get hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16591.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that to have a solution is very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16593.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's using free cash once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16596.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People keep saying that I'm saying that we do this all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16600.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We do this once because this community had over $35 million, over $34 million of free cash that we could have used and then sat together in an open process to see what we can do together as a total community to see what we needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16619.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16620.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, new growth and development is so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16625.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We look at the way that our budget was underfunded in certain aspects, but underappreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16633.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we have to look at so many different options in the future, but what we lacked and the reason why we're here is because our mayor and our administration use one-time funding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16647.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to carry her water for the last five and a half years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16652.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why we are where we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=125.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right now, for the November 5th ballot, we'll have question six, question seven, question eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=134.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Question six is a debt exclusion, like I explained, is a tax that you'll be taxed until the project or the bond is complete, and then it comes off the tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=146.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that reads,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=149.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That exclusion on fire stations shall the city of Medford be allowed to exempt from the provisions of proposition two and a half, so-called the amounts required to pay for the bonds issued in order to pay for costs of construction, a new fire station headquarters to be located at 120 Main Street in Medford, including the payment of all costs related design, the project equipping and furnishing, the project site improvements and all other costs<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=179.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: incidental to related there too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=184.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you'll vote no, because that's been a lot of people's questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=188.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: George, I thought you supported the firefighters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=191.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, when you hear it straight from the people that I think Danielle put it perfectly when she said, we don't want to sound like the angry people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=202.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Instead, look to see what our firefighters have gone through, what our men and women have gone through in the last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=209.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and how they've been treated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=211.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And yet again, they're gonna stand up and say what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=215.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What you're offering was not transparent, was not inclusive, was a decision made in a box, and the funding is gonna hurt our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=228.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they're willing to stand up and say what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=233.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'd rather not have our residents of Medford hurt<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=239.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: financially for an inferior product.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=242.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please do not vote for question six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=247.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Danielle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=254.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Question seven is funding schools and street repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=261.424s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Shall the city of Medford be allowed to assess an additional 3.5 million in real estate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=267.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and personal property taxes for FY25 general operations of the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=273.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $3 million includes but not limited to funding costs for teachers, literacy coaches, behavior specialists, administrative assistants, nurses, and for regular facility maintenance, and for FY25 general operations DPW, including but not limited<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=294.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to additional staff for road and sidewalk infrastructure repair for fiscal year beginning July 1, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=302.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, this question seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=308.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $500,000, come on, for the roads and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=314.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: ARPA, when it was originally put forth, was directly supposed to go to infrastructure needs, roads and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=326.544s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=328.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now we sit here and say we're going to give them $500.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=331.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=333.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is an initiative that I put forth years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=337.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We try to put a sidewalk and hot tub crew together to save the city money because the mayor kept coming to us for $2.5 million bonds for sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=348.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we never saw sidewalks being done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=350.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We could never catch up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=352.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know my colleagues say, see?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=354.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: See?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=354.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=355.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have no money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=357.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=358.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=360.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I love the dialogue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=367.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Public schools, teachers, literacy coaches, behavior specialists, nurses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=376.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The superintendent has already, the expert in the state has shared some amazing information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=386.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have we been resourceful?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=389.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Has the school committee and the school department been resourceful in creating revenue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=397.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=399.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know my colleagues will say, again, he's not telling the truth because their social media sites tell you that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=407.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I have shown everyone, very simple, meeting after meeting, and if you want to look up, watch them on YouTube,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=415.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: From step to step, we showed an avenue to come out of this without hurting kids or teachers or schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=424.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We showed them that avenue through free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=428.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what did they do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=431.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They imposed a rule to shut me up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=435.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=438.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One of our members got a phone call from a school kid member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=442.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that school kid member said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=445.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How dare you put a no sign on your lawn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=451.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are you going to be happy when we lay off 40 teachers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=454.842s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Shame on that person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=457.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because that's the same exact question I posed in the open meeting in front of everybody and said, why put the schools, the children, the teachers through this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=469.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Take the $5 million out of free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=472.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: put the fear away, and then let's all get to the table and make the right decision for our community with an open and transparent process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=484.526s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that, ladies and gentlemen, question seven, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=497.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I like the drama behind this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=500.827s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Question 8 is intense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=504.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Question 8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=505.671s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This override will expand vocational programs and increase student access to the arts by giving us the funding to pay for new programming, staff to help students succeed,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=518.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: level and increase educator and paraprofessional compensation to ensure living in competitive wages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=525.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Doesn't that sound expensive?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=528.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Vocational.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=529.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe what it is, Roy you can help me if I'm wrong, is expanding the day, the school day, and the vocational day would kind of merge together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=541.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what we're asking for, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=545.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What, I believe it's maybe through negotiations will be the biggest cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=552.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, what we're looking at is nothing close to $4 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=558.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not even close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=560.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not even close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=562.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Understand the trend here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=565.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Six, we heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=566.548s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Seven and eight, education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=569.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Understand every single community that has fought for an override<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=574.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and their communities has used what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=577.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The children in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=581.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Don't hurt our children, don't hurt our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=585.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I asked my colleagues, and the people on the other side that's supporting this, where were you the meeting that you shut me up when we asked for free cash that we had?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=600.048s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you were there, and you still have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=604.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So let's understand this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=607.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now that you know the questions, let's go all the way back now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=613.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And let's make sure we get this and people can hear it, you can share with your friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=618.922s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All Medford, at no time have we ever said, we're against an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=625.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We do not want it, never.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=627.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was never said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=631.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=633.839s">[Scarpelli]</a>: was let's fix what's wrong now with that $5 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=637.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's bring everybody together to the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=640.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's have an open and transparent process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=643.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And let's work together to make sure we, if the need is there, that we fulfill it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=652.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And don't divide the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=654.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is what has happened now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=656.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now we're dividing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=658.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now it's yes or no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=659.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll be honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=662.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a responsible member of this community, if I didn't think now that we're here, there's nothing we can do, we'd have to step away, I'd step away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=671.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we have $34 million in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=675.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $34 million in free cash that has not been used that can recover this funding and make sure that we do this process correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=685.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=688.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And for those who don't know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=692.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just a quick step-by-step so you understand, it's never quick with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=697.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had our budget meeting last year, the year before last.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=702.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And my colleagues were in unison, Councilor Caraviello was there, Council President Beas was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=710.035s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we were all together in the process that we cannot support this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=716.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's too dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=718.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we were all for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=722.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Until the night of the meeting, Councilor Caraviello and I stood there, and our council leadership team came out and said, hey, we just met with the mayor behind closed doors, and we're going to vote for the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=736.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've come to an agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=737.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What agreement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=740.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't know what agreement it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=741.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Caraviello, Councilor Mike didn't know what agreement it was, but there was some sort of agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=746.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, as this grew, we kind of realized what the agreement was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=750.981s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A financial task force was created.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=755.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A school kid member, two city Councilors, the chief of staff, and the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=763.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Five people with no background in financial battles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=770.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=772.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At least not enough to lead us to the spot we need to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=778.92s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we move forward, this financial task force is meeting, we don't hear anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=782.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are no minutes, there's no information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=786.065s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're told we're gonna get a meeting before we do anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=791.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, you hear rumblings, so we call for a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=795.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have our city council meeting, and I believe it was a week before we had a subcommittee meeting, and a very smart resident,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=805.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: very important, powerful question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=806.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They said, so if you ask for an override and it doesn't pass, what does that mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=814.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That means devastation for the school department and our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=820.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Imagine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=822.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I came back the following week and I presented a plan that said what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=829.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Use our free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=832.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's come to the table and do the right thing for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=835.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and let's not leverage our kids in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=841.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But guess what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=844.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's called Rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=845.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Counsel Scarpelli shut down, can't speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=852.417s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is how we're getting messages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=854.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The Financial Task Force's plan was an override plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=858.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was what they came out with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=860.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We asked for the minutes, we asked for more information, how do we get there, who was involved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=864.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=867.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now maybe the other side, because my friends are telling me, George, they're beating you up, they're beating you up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=871.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=873.859s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is all true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=876.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is all on tape.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=880.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, typical fashion, Friday we get emails from the mayor's office with $7.5 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=891.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Tuesday we come to a meeting, we're gonna vote on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=896.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a responsible city councilor, I will now invoke our Rule 21, close the meeting, and ask for an open meeting with everybody to talk about this in more depth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=909.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something that's unheard of, has never been heard of, never been done before, but council leadership suspends the rules of the meeting and imposes a vote to not invoke Rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=925.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Done, you can't talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=926.999s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you, the council had five subcommittee meetings to talk about a city council newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=935.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=936.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And guess what that, that's free, nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=940.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But, the paper's adding up to $7.5 million and possibly more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=947.105s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They don't wanna talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=948.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, what do we do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=950.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We move on to the next meeting, and they said okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=952.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I reach out to my state representative and I asked him, what is the plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=956.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What can I do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=957.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they said, okay, legal from the state said you can now invoke Mass General Law 43, section 22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=966.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That supersedes any method rule, shuts the meeting down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=970.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, we get to the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=972.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our leadership team does the same exact thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=975.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Suspends the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=978.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Says they cannot impose rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=979.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I then invoke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=983.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Section 22, council leadership says, no, you can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=990.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Against the rule, against the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=994.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because what was going to be said is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=999.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And listen closely, because this is how real communities do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1003.186s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In 2009, working in the city of Somerville, Mayor Joe Hurtatone was at a crossroads with his community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1011.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Big cuts looming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1013.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He convenes a group, a working group, a financial working group that consisted of financial minds from Tufts, MIT, Harvard, banking leaders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1026.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You had the Sloans from Century Bank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1031.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You had his financial team present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1034.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You had community leaders and business leaders all in a row.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1038.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they worked on a plan because they said you needed to figure out three things before you wanted to go to Novartis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1044.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One, how do we get there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1048.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still don't know how we got here, at least publicly, there's nothing been mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1054.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Two, how do we fix it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1057.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Three, how does this never happen again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1061.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what we were taught.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1064.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, they came out and they said, okay, this is what we're going to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1067.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to look at traffic and parking fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1069.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not going to make people happy, but they're going to take that money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1071.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're going to increase those fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1073.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're going to take that money, and that's going to be dedicated solely to the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1079.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Boom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1080.313s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Need taken away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1082.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1084.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need streets and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1086.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How do we figure that out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1088.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The focus is fees and fines for trash and building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1094.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And boom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1095.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Developers paid for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1098.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then the third piece, the most important piece, they sat together and they said, well, what can we do so this never happens again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1104.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How do we bring Somerville out of this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1107.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, they started this little project called Assembly Row.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1112.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now, whether you like it or not, there's a lot of money coming into the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1119.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, maybe you might question the growth, maybe question how they got there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1122.663s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not what I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1123.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'm saying is, that was an open process<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1127.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with financial minds that sat together to find a solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1133.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What has happened here, both in the fire department and the school department, it's been done in a vacuum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1141.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nobody knows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1144.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that a member of the community did file a FOIA request asking information for, we're waiting on that, hopefully we get that soon, that we can share with the community of what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1156.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: was shared, minutes, any notes, anything taken with this financial group?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1162.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who were the professionals they might have brought in that we don't know that could have helped them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1165.822s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nobody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1167.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here we are today, middle of September, people still don't know that there's an override vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1176.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like Councilor Caraviello said, he had explained to a person yesterday, why are we fighting it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1181.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $7.5 million for a new high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1183.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1187.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1190.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1193.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So people are saying, you know, but, you know, Councilor Scarpelli shouldn't be doing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1197.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's a city councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1198.839s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't give a shit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1204.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm gonna fight for what I think is right and so every citizen is heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1208.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I will tell you, it's not that I'm new to this or I wouldn't do this or I wouldn't have the guts to do something like this because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1216.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were three former Councilors in this room, and only one of them, sorry Rick, only one of them put forth a debt exclusion that was probably put together by the best financial mind in Medford, an Aleesha Nunley, and we looked at the process of creating funding for a new main fire station on Main Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1240.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it was so simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1242.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We would exclude senior citizens because you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1245.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're hurting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1247.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Senior citizens are hurting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1251.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The vulnerable community, our disabled, our veterans, eliminate that group, those groups, and see what we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1260.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe at the time it was $17 a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1264.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We could swallow that, couldn't we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1266.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But that was with the process that gets started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1268.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even with this process right now, nobody knows what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1272.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still don't know what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1274.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing's been posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1276.963s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know there's rumblings that money's already being spent from free cash out of the $34 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1283.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing's been done yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1287.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So having this meeting tonight is so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1289.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This fundraiser's so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1290.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I tell you, I gotta thank so many people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1294.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The restaurants that donated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1296.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: LaCasha's, Ronnie's Place, Richie Razzo's from Razzo's and Avellino's, always donate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1304.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1308.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The thousands of dollars that were donated just the other day was amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1315.187s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And guess where that money's coming from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1318.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1320.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: hard-working, method residents that want to do anything they can and fight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1325.824s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My neighbor, who's 84 years old, came to my house today and said, George, I can't come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1331.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He has $8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1337.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, God, no, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1340.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I tell you, what we do know is Kelly has done a great job with the real estate side and understanding the assessing side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1347.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have Nate Merritt's been doing his deep dive into the calculator that they have on their site that says all you do is poke in these numbers, bam, it's always this much money, you can handle that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1361.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Bullshit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1364.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I'm gonna tell you straight up, $380 for a person might sound not a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1373.311s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But some of the people I've talked to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1376.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I keep saying it, I won't use her last name, but I love her dearly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1378.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see Mrs. Jones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1380.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She said, George, help me understand this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1383.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I bought my house 50, 60 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1387.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So $48,000, I believe she said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1389.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think I tell people $50,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1392.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But now my house is worth a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1396.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My husband died 15 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1398.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was a seamstress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1400.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My social security doesn't cover my taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1404.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So should I move?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1406.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Some people want them to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1408.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I haven't heard one thing supporting our senior citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1412.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I haven't heard one thing how we're gonna help those homeowners that are struggling to stay in their homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1417.636s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Cuz one of my council colleagues actually said to me is, if your house is worth a million dollars, just take a hundred out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1424.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1426.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The understanding of not understanding what a home equity line is, that's devastating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1432.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Devastating for residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1436.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're not candy coating anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1438.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not hiding anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1440.01s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything you see has been public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1443.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have told my council colleagues what they're doing is dangerous to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1449.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still don't see the information how we got here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1452.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The way they want to get out of it is by taxing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1455.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Here's the other piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1456.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hey, it's only this much money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1459.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I hear that again from people, I'm going to lose my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1462.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because understand this, and I'll end with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1466.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What did we talk about one of our first meetings subcommittee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1469.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Rent control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1471.407s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then we talked about a transfer tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1474.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then we talked about a registry fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1477.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we talked about overrides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1482.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it stops there, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1484.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1485.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because my brother, I'll use my brother for example, just got his house assessed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1491.18s">[Scarpelli]</a>: An additional $400 a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1495.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, he's a young man, works very hard, hopefully he can recover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1501.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But then, Kelly did some homework, and we found out his assessment in 20 to 24 that's starting now, he thinks it's over with the assessment side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1512.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But Kelly, what did we say, what are we hearing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1525.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's going up again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1527.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So have we heard any of that in their homework?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1531.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1532.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it's only $400.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1534.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But let's go a step further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1538.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A minimum $200 million renovated high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1543.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who fits that bill?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1545.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1548.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We want a new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1549.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A new one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1550.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Take it down to one new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1552.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Looking at $400 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1555.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You people don't understand what that number equates to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1560.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1562.756s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's scary and it's dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1566.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I didn't want to bring you out to scare you, but I brought you out to wake you up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1571.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This group never wanted to say no to an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1575.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we heard it from the smartest educational mind that I've been around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1583.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we haven't seen enough creativity, we haven't seen enough information, and there has been no transparency to show that we need this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1594.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've talked to our fire department, our firefighters are saying, don't hurt our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1601.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Don't build something just to check a box.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1604.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't want the fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1607.553s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1609.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if they're saying it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1612.888s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I've spelt it out for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1615.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a very simple process right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1621.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Fix the budget with the $5 million in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1624.953s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's move forward and think of different ways to be creative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1627.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's be shocking and look at new growth and development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1632.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something we haven't seen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1634.016s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Am I lying, Ricky?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1637.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How many 40B jobs did we lose?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1639.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Three, how much money just in permits with those three projects?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1644.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Millions of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1645.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then tax revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1647.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've done the homework on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1649.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How much?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1649.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $16 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1649.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's one building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1650.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, these aren't lies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1652.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are true numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1653.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, you wish you had a platform<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1668.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I've been shut up way too easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1671.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, in this forum, I'm not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1672.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you're my voice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1673.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're helping us spread the message now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1676.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1678.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a list right now of over 600 volunteers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1681.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 600 volunteers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1682.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have captains that are gonna be doing standouts that we have about, what, 60 to 80 people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1688.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 60 to 80 people already signed up to do standouts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1697.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm asking all of you, October 15th, Zach, if you wanna come on out, we're gonna meet at Hormel Stadium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1704.313s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody's gonna come out and we're gonna take our message and we're gonna go to the neighborhoods and we're gonna knock on doors and we're gonna give people the information that no one in the city has given them to help them understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1717.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Understand the rest of everybody else, don't be afraid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1719.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If a school kid member knocks on your door and says shame on you, be armed that you have the information right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1726.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: beyond that you know the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1732.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So tomorrow, when you go to the coffee shop, or tomorrow when you go next door and you talk to Dave and have a cold drink, sit down with him and say, hey, do you know about the overrides?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1742.64s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the fire don't want it, the educational minds think it's absurd, and it's gonna hurt people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1751.763s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here's the other piece that I seem to forget, and I don't ever want to forget this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1758.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have lived in a, grew up in a home with tenants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1761.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My dad made sure that we treated our tenants with pride and with respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1766.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we made sure we kept our rent reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1769.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the fact that my brother took that, and we still have the same family there that have been there for 10 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1776.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That family pays for a four bedroom in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1779.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They pay $2,400.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1779.763s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Pretty cheap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1782.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We all know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1783.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He will not raise that rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1787.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What people have to understand, if these taxes come about, taxpayers cannot handle this on their own.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1795.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's going to be passed down to the tenants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1798.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And renters are going to go through the roof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1802.705s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I want to thank all of you for coming out tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1806.168s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did I miss anything, Rick?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1807.93s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are you sure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1809.071s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's my captain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1809.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Rick's going to tell me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1811.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, again, I will tell you, we've got great people working on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1815.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm so excited for the energy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1818.487s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right now, we have 260 signs already on the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1822.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Steve's gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1823.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have 260 signs on the street, and we have another 200 here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1829.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Make sure you take your sign, but make sure you leave your name and your address so we know you've taken it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1836.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And show your neighbors and just give us a call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1841.487s">[Scarpelli]</a>: override, when you vote for an override and we give the mayor six million dollars, even though they say that the money is going to go to the vocational school or art programs, that's not necessarily true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1859.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The money goes into the general fund to be used to the mayor's discretion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1866.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1868.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a reason why we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1870.071s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $9 million in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1876.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those people that wanna know real simple what free cash is, free cash is the money that we approve for the prior year in the budget that the mayor does not use, does not spend, and then it gets certified and carried over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1890.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then it goes into an account that she can do anything she wants with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1896.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1898.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I hope tonight what we really wanted to do is educate some people, bring them out, have them know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1908.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Understand that we'll be having, if you please sign up for the standouts, we'll be doing door knocking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1913.768s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the big one is gonna be October 15th, Saturday, nine o'clock at Cornell Stadium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1920.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna be meeting there and we're all gonna be hitting the streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1924.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna be going into the neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1926.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna be knocking on the doors, talking to your neighbors, and letting them know that if this is voted through, it's not gonna hurt the children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1934.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor's just gonna have to put the money that she's playing with back to where it's supposed to be and help our children and help our schools and help our seniors and our residents so they don't get killed with these taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1947.209s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, thank you all for coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1949.191s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have a safe ride home, and we'll talk to you soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=160.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have to thank my team, there's so many of them, but I want to thank everybody that's here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=164.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you're from All-Method, if you could just raise your hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=166.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just thanking you for being here tonight and helping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=169.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=173.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've had a few events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=175.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know tonight's a tough, tough night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=176.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we had about three different events tonight, but we said we need to do something because things are happening really quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=185.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the reason that we're here is because we wanted to talk about the Proposition 2.5 override and the debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=191.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there are three questions that will be on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=195.824s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll give you some more information later on after a few people speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=201.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But one is the debt exclusion, which is for a new fire headquarters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=209.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm very fortunate that we have one of our union leaders from the fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=214.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Danielle Masolino is going to be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=215.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's going to speak in a little while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=217.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And proud to say someone that I called and asked his opinion because I think he is probably the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=225.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the smartest educational mind, at least in Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=230.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's someone that I respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=232.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And sad to say, I don't think people respect him enough until that person's gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=237.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I called this gentleman and I asked him some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=242.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And within five minutes, you just feel better because he just educates you with his knowledge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=248.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I asked him if he can come out and spend a Friday night to come out and speak and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=254.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: give his opinion and what, you know, his perspective as an educational leader, someone that ran our school system for many, many years, still works at the state level, high level at the state, and he's gonna share some of his knowledge, and then we'll fill in some gaps that people had that had some questions, and we can help educate everybody so they understand what this means on November 7th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=277.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So right now, I'd like to introduce my friend Roy Belson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1697.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm honored that a friend of ours who's worked so hard for firefighters to capture grants and take the pressure off our citizens in our tax base, Secretary for our union, Danielle Masolino is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1711.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Welcome, Danielle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=124.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=253.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=255.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=256.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is there anybody from the administration available to speak?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=262.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The chief of staff or someone else from the mayor's office?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=276.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=277.969s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have one question that I was informed by another city department that they were told that they needed to stop their negotiations because of fear of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=292.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the outcome of the override so they didn't want to commit, I believe, to move forward with any issues with funding moving forward until they know what happens in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=306.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm a little curious if that's the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=310.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe we should look at, I know there are some issues that we see that are on here now that I wouldn't object to because I know it's time sensitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=322.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it's something that's really needed, I think we should move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=325.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if there are concerns with the override vote and funding moving forward, that they're holding off negotiations, then I think it's something we need to talk about, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=340.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1384.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1386.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, Mr. Randazzo again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1387.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for everything you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1389.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, uh, you are your, um, history and saving money for our community is second to none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1397.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that everyone should realize that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1400.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But my question is, along with this, I've I've gotten many phone calls from the business district, and I know what some of the changes in parking in Medford Square that the discussion has been that there's going to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1414.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, the parking for the business community, um, on, um, on Salem Street next to that parking lot next to the I believe it's a national grid building their substation building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1428.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One of the concerns that the businesses has that there is no lighting in that lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1434.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that been discussed by any chance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1436.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, we are office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1475.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1475.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1476.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1624.714s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1627.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A question on that topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1632.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is the elevator still currently out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1654.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, I bring this up because last night we had a very important meeting and I think everybody unanimously decided that having a community meeting with our senior citizens that we're having some confusion on what the debt exclusion and the override questions were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1672.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I get had a few phone calls today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1675.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh from uh representing people that are representing that uh our senior citizens and they were very concerned that uh will the elevators be functioning on october 15th and if not i think we need to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1690.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: seriously consider moving that committee to the whole meeting to a location where senior citizens can attend that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1699.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it defeats the purpose of what we agreed on yesterday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1703.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we have people that can't climb stairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1706.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is the 15th something that can work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1740.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, if we can, if we just have the clerk, if we can, as soon as Mr. Riggi gets us an update, if we can update the council with that, that'd be greatly appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1751.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1892.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Forgive me, that's a late hand Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1990.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1993.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, it's not the fire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1997.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was, uh, was talking to someone from the negotiating team from our method police department and they were told during negotiations, I believe that negotiations will be delayed, um, for the fact that the override, um, might be in question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2013.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So because of that fact that we need to, um, hold off until we get more understanding or, or see what the vote would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2022.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2025.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in November to move forward with their negotiations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2028.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, the second part of that question is that if that is an issue, um, I'm under the impression that, uh, there's a negotiating line item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2039.407s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if if that's not the case, could you educate me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2043.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if there is a case that that it is, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2047.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if you can let us know what we are with that as well because in my in my capacity when there's negotiations there's understanding that most municipalities have a negotiated line item that has funding already set aside and if we're holding that out<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2068.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because of fear that the override will not move forward and needing that funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2075.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It could be construed of maybe as a fair tactic if the administration is moving in a for yes vote or it then leaves me a little befuddled if we don't have a line item when we negotiate with our union members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2092.796s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2144.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2147.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, just with that, though, I just, I think it is a direct correlation of what we're asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2153.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2154.747s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If that is, and we do find that until until we get to our next regular meeting, where we will vote on these, these initiatives, I think that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2164.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the understanding that if we're looking at, and this is the case, if you do find research and they do come back and says, no, we did mention that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2175.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if that's the case, then it's relevant for tonight's meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2181.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the fact that if we do have questions about our financial question marks after the override and where,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2191.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we're talking we're we're discussing this with a negotiating team then i think that everything has to be on the table when the mayor presents any sort of funding for anything right now um like i said there are things that are presented today that when it comes to a vote i i don't think i can hesitate because i think it's needed but there are some other things that we can look at and say hey i would like i would motion to sever and then look at the different options because of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2218.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh the need of funding if that's the case moving forward so i think there's a direct correlation of what i was told and what is on the agenda tonight so thank you mr president and thank you chief of staff nazarian thank you and thank you for being here councillor Leming um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2267.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: yeah i apologize i just want to make sure if it's if i'm confusing councillor uh Leming i can clarify if he wants um the confusion is if there is an issue that's dealing with our city financial concerns and and one group or one situation is being um frozen for uh the the fear of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2291.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: lack of funding later on in November, then this would be a concern moving any money doctor to the next level, considering if there is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2305.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: some fear and I appreciate the chief of staff looking into it and hoping it's just a rumor, but I got it from a credible source.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2314.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's actually part of the negotiating team that said that that did happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2318.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'd like to see maybe, maybe there's some misunderstanding there and get some corrections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2323.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if you're confused with that, I can clear it up if you have any questions for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2397.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2401.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I understand that we have, we have, we, we can, we can respect, excuse me, we can, we can agree to disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2411.477s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I think it's important that, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2415.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if it does come to a climate when we need to petition to move funding around from different accounts, there are mechanisms that we could do that depending on what accounts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2426.486s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would say everything would be open until we understand the true financial picture on November 5th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2433.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2646.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think you have, I just got a text message, Mr. Clerk, that maybe I'm out of line, but there's people trying to get on the Zoom that had questions with that response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2657.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But like I said, I will move this forward and with a yes vote until we get more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2665.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2667.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2668.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, oh yeah, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2673.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, no, it's Harold McGilvrey, the negotiating from the police department wanted to get on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2680.745s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2681.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2682.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2682.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2682.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it would be yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2741.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry, Mr. Clerk, did you call my name?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2745.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, I'd say no, I wanna hear more of what Council President is saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2751.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can't worry about his percentages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=53.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Medford Happenings, I think, is a very vital asset to our community, as well as our Medford community cable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=60.695s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Access channel, I think that without a a Newspaper in Medford to get information out to our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=68.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's so important that you're doing this So I thank you very much for doing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=99.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, it's a pretty in-depth opinion, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=105.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, we, as a city councilor, it's my responsibility and our responsibility to make sure that we are the financial stewards of our residents' budgets and making sure that our tax money is being spent appropriately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=121.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One thing we realized in our communities without, like I said, without a newspaper, we found it very difficult to get information out, and this being a good example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=130.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So a few months back a group was organized called All Medford and the All Medford group started to really educate and communicate and really bring pride back to Medford and it's been super successful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=145.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've had hundreds if not thousands of people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=148.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: join our group, and when I say our group, I as a member, as our group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=153.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're now jumping right into a very serious, you know, situation and big step here in Medford, which is an override, Proposition 2 and F overrides and a debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=171.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what I'd like to do, if you don't mind, John, I'd like to start with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=175.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: explaining to our constituents and our viewers that there are three votes that they'll be taking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=181.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They'll be question six, question seven, and question eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=185.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Question six is a debt exclusion for a rebuild of a new fire station headquarters on Main Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=195.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a 30 million dollar project<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=197.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that I will share with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=201.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The firefighters have come out publicly and they are not supporting the override for the fact that, you'll see a trend as I go through my speech today, but you'll see that there weren't really, the firefighters weren't involved in the final decision making of that fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=224.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they're,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=226.035s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In the conversations with the union leaders, one of the major issues is that there was really no, there was no partnership involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=235.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one, no firefighters were really involved in the final decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=238.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we were heard from firefighter Marcelino, Danielle Marcelino, who's the secretary for the union, she explained that they would not support the debt exclusion for the fire station because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=253.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was an inferior product and it's not set up for success as they move forward in the lives of future Medford firefighters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=263.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So with that, they said, you know, let's be responsible enough to share with the community that they would rather not let the citizens of Medford suffer with the tax<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=274.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: just to check a box.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=275.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they responded back and they're not going to support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=279.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So question six is about a new fire headquarters on Main Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=283.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And question seven was presented from the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=292.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for an override in question seven is $3.5 million of our property, our real estate taxes for our community for 2025 and from the general operations of Medford public school, $3 million for the Medford public schools, which includes but not limited for teachers, literacy coaches, behavior specialists, and administrative assistants and so on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=318.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Question 8 was put forth asking for a $4 million override tax from our real estate and personal properties for 2025 as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=332.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they're looking for increasing access to the arts and vocational programs and expanding classroom instructional opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=344.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are simple taxes and they were put forth, and I'll publicly say, as scare tactics from the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=354.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can see that the overrides, and let me just educate everybody a little bit because some people don't really understand what a debt exclusion is in comparison to a Proposition 2.5 override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=366.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A debt exclusion is a tax to the community, to the residents, that will be put on their taxes every year until the project that it's funding is complete.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=380.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if it's $30 million for a new fire station, you would then start the clock with paying off that bond of $30 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=388.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When that $30 million is paid, that tax will come off the resident's tax roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=394.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they won't see that tax anymore once it's paid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=397.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The misconception is the Proposition 2.5 override<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=402.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=403.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You will get taxed a certain percentage from your home's assessed value, your real estate tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=410.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Which is going up, by the way, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=413.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll explain more with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=414.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And with that process, that's a tax that's being misled in the public by people that are saying that if it's just $400 for the year, it's not just $400 for a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=427.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, let's start off by saying that when that tax is starting is January of 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=433.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's voted in November Wow, it'll go into place starting in January of 2025 which our residents most of our residents Won't be prepared for that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=444.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll now start that tax and at the end of every year There is some understanding that some taxpayers have reached out to me and said oh, yeah, then then it's done I said no It doesn't what ends up happening is that tax bump that you're going to see for this override will then compound every year Every year at least two and a half percent every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=466.436s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It'll stay with you forever never goes away never goes away now in clear up a few other misconceptions<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=474.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The comment that we're hearing is, it's just this, it's just that, it's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=480.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know that this council has put forth in the past rent control, transfer tax, a renter's and owner's registry fee, and what we're looking at down the line is a new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=497.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something that has already been taken out of free cash to start that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=501.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're looking at a close to a, if it's a refurbished, maybe $200 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=506.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if for a new high school, it's $400 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=508.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just for an example, neighboring community just did their high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=512.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Debt exclusion was put in for over $240 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=516.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's $1,000 more a year in taxes for each household.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=521.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $1,000 more for each household, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=522.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's not just what people are saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=526.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, I know the other side, the Yes Group, has a calculator in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=530.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=531.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=531.51s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the calculator is misleading because we've had phone calls from different organizations, different people that have questioned that, saying that I put my address in and the number that's coming out is wrong because my assessed value and what they're saying my house is assessed at is totally wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=546.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we've done our homework, and we reached out to the assessor, and the assessor has informed us that no one in his office has been involved in setting up any calculator for any organization to educate our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=560.73s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they know nothing about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=562.191s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a matter of fact, they also shared that the assessment team, our assessors,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=570.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: don't even understand how they can even conceivably work in an override if it was voted in in November because it's such a daunting task.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=580.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we asked, well, could you possibly put in place a calculator so residents can see what kind of an impact a true calculator through the assessor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=590.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He said no one's asked him to do that and he doesn't plan on doing it right now because they are so busy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=594.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is from the city's assessor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=596.512s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the city assessor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=597.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is from the city assessor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=599.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the understanding that it's just this much money, it's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=603.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=604.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that what I see as a trend that's bothering me is that our most vulnerable members of our community are threatened right now, and they should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=614.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if you're a senior citizen, you're living on a fixed income, if you are a veteran, if you are disabled, and you find it very difficult even just to survive right now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=624.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This could destroy them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=626.107s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Destroy them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=646.745s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's a realistic option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=649.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The misconception of some of my colleagues on the city council that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=655.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, if the house is worth a million dollars, they could just take $100,000 out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=658.168s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I share a story, and I won't give my neighbor's name because I love her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=662.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's call her Mrs. Jones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=663.91s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mrs. Jones bought her house for $50,000 years ago with her and her husband, raised her family, lives there today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=670.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She was a seamstress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=672.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, Mrs. Jones' husband passed away 15 years ago, but the home is now appraised at a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=678.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With her social security and her husband's retirement, it's very difficult for Mrs. Jones to survive in her home because her home is being assessed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=687.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And just for taxes alone makes it very difficult for the choices she can make, whether it's eating something special during the week or paying for her medication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=699.584s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So people don't realize the impact, and it's true impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=703.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh... so i i think that's important as hundreds people hundreds of people in the city just like in a right there is i mean let's be honest that's a big part of it i mean so this is really going to affect everybody what i mean what if you rent well and i think that people don't realize that unfortunately you look at you look at some people like mrs jones same situation right that on the two or three family met for it uh... you would see that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=730.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the trickle-down effect, where they can't afford to pick up the total cost that's being added to them, that they would have to put it onto their renters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=739.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they don't want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=739.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will tell you, my dad was a homeowner of a two-family, and we took a lot of pride in making sure that our tenants<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=749.671s">[Scarpelli]</a>: were secure enough in the rent that they can maybe move forward and purchase a house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=754.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we were lucky that we had five great tenants and four have moved on to own homes, and the fifth, my dad's moved on to heaven for a few years now, but my brother now owns the home and he still keeps that tenant's rent reasonable for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=770.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, the renters and, you know, you look at our tough students, they're going to be put in a bad situation as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=777.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because a lot of our tough students do rent, and that's going to impact them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=782.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our small businesses, maybe you don't realize it, but when a family has to make a decision of just $400 or just X amount of dollars, they have to make cuts somewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=793.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And unfortunately, it's going to trickle down to our small businesses as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=807.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think what people have to realize, too, because we've done some homework.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=810.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that there are people on the other side that would like to say that there are organizations, like All Medford, who really have taken the leadership in this fight against the override because they see how it hurts most of the Medford residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=827.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that they've done the homework, and we have communications back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=832.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that one member has talked with the assessor again, and just so people understand that own homes, your homes have recently been assessed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=843.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you can see that hike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=845.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then you see taxes that might possibly be added on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=848.859s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then you look at an override for a new high school that's going to be added on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=852.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What people don't realize next year in 2025, Holmes and Medford will be reassessed again, but they'll be using<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=859.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the numbers from 2023.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=861.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And why is that important?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=863.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our homes were assessed a lot higher in 2023 than they are today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=867.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you're going to see a bump again in people's taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=871.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's funny that people that, you know, might not understand this because they don't own a home yet, but what they need to understand is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=881.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When the homes, they say in Medford, we're taxed low, and we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=885.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're very fortunate that our homes are taxed low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=887.64s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What they don't realize, the neighboring communities they want to compare us to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=893.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: don't have the assessments that we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=896.316s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So apples to apples, our numbers are pretty complimentary to our neighbors next door that might think that they have lower taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=904.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it will play a huge factor in people's lives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=935.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, if I can, John, I think people have to understand where this all started from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=939.423s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=940.763s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what's important is they understand that we're hearing it too, people from all Medford are calling me and saying, George, I can't believe what they're saying about the people that are involved with all Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=952.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, people have to understand this publicly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=955.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The All Method group and the city council, George Scarpelli, has never, ever said, we are fighting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=960.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We never wanted an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=963.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All we actually said was, where is the transparency?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=967.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Explain to us the three most important things that I think that I've heard over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=972.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's important when you look at an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=974.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One, how did we get here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=976.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Two, how do we correct it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=978.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And three, how do we never get here again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=982.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we did is starting the process of city council, and the people that want to say that George Scarpelli is not telling the truth, he's a liar, because that's out there too, and that's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=993.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the difference between what they can say and what's proof, it's the magic of television.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1000.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You can go to YouTube and watch every single meeting, and I'll tell everybody, if you're interested, start back from June 20th of 2023.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1008.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was our budget meeting, and it started there, John.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1012.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had our meeting, and prior to that meeting, all seven Councilors were pretty strong and pretty unified in the fact that what we were seeing financially<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1021.929s">[Scarpelli]</a>: was frightening, and we were not going to support the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1026.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor's budget really lacked a lot of very, very important factors, and we said we're going to stand against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1032.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I believe it was Councilor Caraviello and I who walked into the chambers ready for our Tuesday night meeting, and Councilor Bears at the time came out of a meeting and said to Councilor Caraviello and I, he said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1045.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want to let you guys know that Council President Morell and I met with the mayor behind closed doors, and we came to an agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1053.532s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're going to vote for the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1058.233s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I then said, well, what was the agreement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1061.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because we heard nothing of an agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1064.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the people that we represent, their words and their wishes weren't expressed, and then we went on to that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1070.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That meeting was true and it did happen, and we didn't know what the agreement was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1074.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that Councilor Bears said something about setting up a budget team and working better with our budget, and okay, very vague.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1082.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then we move forward to what we're seeing, and we hear that there was a financial task force that was created<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1089.372s">[Scarpelli]</a>: right after that agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1090.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that financial task force consisted of the mayor, the chief of staff, Council President Bears, Council Vice President Kit Collins, and I believe leadership team from the school committee member Jenny Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1107.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we didn't know what was going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1111.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We never had any public meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1114.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't see any minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1115.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't see any notes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1117.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't get any updates of any financial team working together and what direction we're going into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1122.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we fast forward to the meetings roughly around in May, and we can look at the meetings in May and June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1132.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had discussions with Council President Bears, and I said, when are we hearing this information?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1137.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When is a community going to get involved and be part of this financial task force results?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1145.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the question was, we came to results, and we'll be notified, and everybody will be informed in a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1154.171s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1155.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, in typical fashion, on Thursday or Friday, we get an email from the mayor's office and her communications team, and they come out with an announcement that the financial task force has worked diligently to find the alternative solution for our gap in our financial crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1175.969s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At the time, it was $5 million coming from the school side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1179.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what the financial team expressed on a Friday<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1184.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: presented on a Tuesday was an override and dead exclusions to bring us whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1193.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now why is that frightening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1195.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that meeting I had put in place an option that Medford had over 24 million dollars of free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1204.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And for those people who don't know what free cash is, free cash is the money that is certified through the state that the city is approved for the budget that year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1217.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1218.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's say, just for discussion's sake, let's say the budget was $10 million and you only spend $8 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1227.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, that $2 million gets carried over into an account, what's called free cash, which is the taxpayer's money that was supposed to be used for the citizens and the community that fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1239.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Normally you see communities, but I think you'll see between 3 and 5 percent of an overage that carries over and then goes into that free cash account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1248.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1249.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, in Medford you saw an astronomical number that brought us for the last few years up to $24 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1256.512s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I came forth with an option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1259.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a pretty logical option that said, well, let's take that $5 million out of free cash, let's create a rainy day account, take $5 million out, let's level fund the school department so we eliminate any fear and confusion to our teachers, our students, and our educational process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1278.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as I was presenting that, one of my council colleagues decided that they were going to call what we call in our rules is Rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1288.563s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Rule 21 stops any discussions for that Councilor for that week, and you can follow it up the next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1295.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, the reason why that was important, we knew that the next week the mayor was going to come in and present the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1302.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they halted me from doing that, and then as we moved on, we moved on to the next meeting, but the next meeting, there was a meeting between the next meeting,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1311.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was going to come in as we were presenting this and I was going to stop the meeting and use rule 21 so we can ask can we have public meetings, a public participation, be more transparent about what the financial task force did, what are the numbers, who did you work with, what financial minds did you work with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1331.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: went to the meeting, the city council leadership decided to suspend the rules and impose the freezing of the option to use rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1344.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That means I couldn't stop the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1346.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That means everything was pushed through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1353.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had a free cash $5 million solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1357.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They didn't want to hear it because the so-called financial task force came up with a $7.5 million override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1395.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1396.424s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a matter of fact, it was the total opposite.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1399.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that this administration used the words transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1401.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a very important word that got the mayor elected years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1405.272s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's been totally opposite.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1406.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if you allow me, we can go to the next meeting, John, when we had this next meeting and I reached out to our state delegate and asked him what happens if they impose and suspend the rules again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1420.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I went to the meeting, and they said, you know, so they said, George, you can impose general law, mass general law 43, section 22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1430.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That supersedes the Methodist City Council rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1432.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It would end the meeting so you can have more transparency and ask for more meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1436.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So as I did that, they suspended the rules again, eliminated the vote for rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1443.69s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I invoked section 22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1446.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They then said, no, you cannot use it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1451.313s">[Scarpelli]</a>: against the rules, but they did that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1453.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And in that meeting, you realize we couldn't move forward because, again, we have a message coming out on a Thursday or Friday, and on Tuesday, we're going to vote on millions of dollars in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1467.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're going to push the budget through without having money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1471.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'll revert back to a few weeks, a week prior when a constituent called and said to Councilor Bears, what if the override fails?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1480.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And his words were very strict and direct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1483.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he said, it'll be devastating to our schools and our children and our teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1489.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And my words exactly were, we have a solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1493.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why would we not take that five million out of free cash, put everybody at ease, and then work together and find a solution with those three important things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1504.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How do we get there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1506.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How do we correct it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1507.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How do we never get there again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1509.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so I'll give an example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1510.907s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've had the honor of working with one of the best mayors in the Commonwealth for years, Joseph Curtatone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1519.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we talked, and I said, Mr. Mayor, I'm at a crossroads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1523.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What would you do with this situation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1525.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He says, well, I don't have to make it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1528.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll show you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1528.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he sent me a bunch of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1531.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And in 2009, some of them were in the same situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1534.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They needed an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1535.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But before he did that, he opened up a forum<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1539.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: financial minds from Tufts University, financial minds from Harvard University, MIT, his own financial team that works with his budget every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1549.544s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He brought in community leaders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1551.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He brought in bank leaders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1553.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He brought in free support from the state that have gone through this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1557.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they had open, transparent meetings to say, how do we get there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1561.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they focused on fees and fines for traffic and parking, which those fees came in and then supported the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1571.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They had trash and builder's permits and fees there that went to the roads and sidewalks and streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1579.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that finished that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1580.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then for the future, there's a little job called assembly row that they started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1585.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And assembly row stopped any future issues of fear into any overrides because it was a new revenue stream.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1594.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something that in Medford, when you look at our issues and concerns, when you talk about our budget, I know our council wants to talk about new growth being the best it's ever been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1605.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1607.424s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't had one shovel in the ground for one project since the mayor has been in business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1630.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I'll give you a couple for example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1631.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had at the time three projects a few years back that were ready to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1635.466s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They were called 40B projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1637.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the 40B projects, they're special projects that you're giving more of a freedom to have that opportunity to build and develop without any question because you're really focused on affordable housing, something I think we drastically need here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1653.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor fought these projects to the fact that not only knowing that you were going to lose these in court, and she did, then she appealed them and she lost, she did, and unfortunately she stretched this out so long that these developers just turned and took their business to other communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1671.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that Councilor Caraviello was very involved in these situations, and he talked about, you know, even for one job, you looked at $3 million in permits and fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1682.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That would have come to the city and nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1683.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That would have come to the city, yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1684.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then a new tax base of maybe even more, like $4 to $6 million, I believe, for our tax base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1691.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You want to see where the gaps are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1692.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's where they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1694.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that could be corrected if the mayor really puts her actions to her words, because nothing's being done except the beer hall, which is very good, by the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1704.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But that's not going to bring the revenue we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1706.928s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you see the issues that we have, and we see our going back to this financial task force, we're seeing that there really isn't much information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1716.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For instance,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1717.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it's not for you right now to bring this forward, most of our residents don't even know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1721.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll give you a couple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1723.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had a constituent say, George, $7 million for a new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1727.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why wouldn't we do it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1729.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I had to explain to them, $7 million is for a new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1733.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what people are spinning as the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1737.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1738.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is very, these are very dangerous times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1741.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, I will tell you, as we lead forward to this, when these meetings are going on in May and June, the fear came out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1749.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The students, the kids, the teachers, our educational process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1754.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If this doesn't happen, they will be hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1757.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It'll be devastating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1759.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then I said, geez, I tell you what, as a city councilor, when we started talking about a newsletter, city council newsletter, we met five times in subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1769.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's an open process to talk about a newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1772.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when you talk about $7.5 million, not one public meeting,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1777.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: not one explanation of what the process was as they went through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1783.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe that, I don't even think that they had a person from the finance team, you know, directly involved at every single meeting, because, and the reason why we don't know, this so-called transparent mayor had<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1798.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: put this in as a task force so they didn't have to follow rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1802.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there were no minutes, there were no public participation, and we truly don't know really how we even got here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1811.423s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All we hear is from the side that wants it is that this is why it's going to affect our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1816.705s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't ever, we never give enough money to the schools, we don't give enough money to the city, and we're very, very undertaxed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1824.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You don't fix issues financially through taxation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1828.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You fix it with new growth and being creative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1831.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we aren't doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1833.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is what's frightening to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1866.171s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1867.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that when we talk about bringing me on tonight and why I jumped at the opportunity, because people don't really know what's going on, especially our senior citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1877.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I bring it up to them, it's funny because people say, George Scarpelli is A, B, and C, whatever fits their dialogue, and he's totally against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1886.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I never said it was against an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1890.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I said was, let's bring everything forward, let's sit down at the table with all the stakeholders and people that are involved in finance and find a solution together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1900.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we didn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1901.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here we are right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1903.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're being told that we're pushing this, we're fighting this because we're angry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1911.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not angry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1913.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was one of the Councilors way back in the day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1915.364s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think I was the last Councilor to do this, and I think in the history of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1919.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I came forth years back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1923.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: offering a debt exclusion for a new fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1926.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And at the time, I believe it was $17 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1929.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I met with the financial director because she had an open-door policy and she was amazing, Aleesha Nunley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1937.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we sat together and I said, Alicia, how do we do this without hurting our seniors and our most vulnerable, our handicapped community and our, excuse me, our disabled community and our veterans?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1948.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And she eliminated that demographic and came back, and I believe it was $17 a month for a new fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1955.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was voted down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1956.579s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a matter of fact, I believe Councilor Bears was on that committee that voted it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1961.164s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so to say that George Scarpelli's city councilor has this agenda just to be negative, it's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=1968.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not one time has anybody discussed how this affects all of our homeowners, and most importantly, our seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2005.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if I can, I know that we talked about this so-called crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2011.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I want everybody to understand this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2014.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had a so-called crisis, financial crisis, that was presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2018.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, if you watch the video from June 2020, June 20th of 2023.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2022.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a city council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2023.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a city council budget meeting where I said, don't do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2028.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're going to destroy and devastate our community financially this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2034.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I felt like Nostradamus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2035.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hated it, but it came true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2038.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we all have to understand something though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2041.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This financial crisis where we had an opportunity to look at free cash and the city knowing what was coming down the line, and I'll get to that, silencing me and moving forward to the vote to put this on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2057.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then we find out a few weeks after that vote that Medford was now<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2064.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: receiving nine million more dollars that were certified by the state that the city administration did not use during the fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2076.368s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the reason why we're in financial crisis is because the city administration didn't use the money accordingly that we the citizens and the taxpayers put forth that we voted on for our budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2091.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now let's move forward now, this financial crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2096.164s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a city councilor, I took what happened at those meetings pretty serious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2100.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I reached out to the state auditor's office and the attorney general's office and how this was handled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2107.949s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The auditor's office, Mr. Zaglia's office representative said, George, they said, their office said, we can't get involved unless the city council votes on it, and then the mayor approves it, and then we would come in and do an audit for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2124.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what's important, people saying, no, no, the audit, we already do an audit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2129.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why should we pay anybody else to do an audit?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2131.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2132.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The audit that comes in that we do every year is very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2135.766s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The person, the group that comes in and does the audit, they look at apples to apples.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2140.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They say you start with 10 million, you spent 10 million, done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2144.293s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With the state audit, it comes in and it looks at the processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2148.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they could tell us, as you look at the process, if the council voted on it and the mayor approved it, you could then see how did we get here and what mistakes we've been making over the last few years because we consistently have millions of dollars of free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2163.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's voted down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2166.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's voted down, city council votes it down, so we can't move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2170.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then you move on to the next step, the next week, right before our summer break.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2178.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And my fellow Councilors vote in during this financial crisis now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2183.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They vote in a raise for themselves, they vote in a raise for the school committee, and they vote a raise in for the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2191.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, John, if you're in financial crisis, if in your home you were having financial issues and concerns, would you then carelessly, let me say, spend the tax mayor's money on something you truly didn't need?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2207.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is what we're seeing right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2209.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're seeing right now<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2211.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with these overrides, and I think it's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2214.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had a great evening the other night with Al Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2217.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We brought in financial minds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2219.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We brought in great speakers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2221.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We brought in, like I said, we brought in the fire secretary, the union secretary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2225.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They came in, gave a pretty extensive response on why they will not support the debt exclusion, how the city should not support a $30 million fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2235.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Roy Bellson, probably one of the smartest educational minds in the state, our former superintendent, broke everything down for our citizens to see where the gaps are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2247.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he has shown us that we do not need an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2250.855s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just need to manage our funds better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2253.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And with that being said, you'll be looking out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2256.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that those speeches will be public very soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2259.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So pretty excited about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2278.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate I'm sorry, but I'm very I'm very passionate about this because it's gonna hurt a lot of people and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2287.77s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unless we know how we got here and how we're going to fix it and how this never happens again, I beg our constituents, I beg our residents, do not vote for this override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2301.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have an option that we still have, I believe, $23 million of free cash that we can stop the mayor from spending anymore, taking that $5 million so our schools, our children, our teachers are safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2314.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not gambling on an override vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2318.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And please remember our seniors and our residents that the so-called just 300 or just whatever isn't looked at as whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2328.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is people's lives and whether they can stay in their homes forever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2333.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if their tenants, their renters can afford a rent hike that might be coming down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2344.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2372.548s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, if people still want to question that, jump on any of the YouTube meetings from City Council and you could see firsthand how it came about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2380.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't something we made up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2382.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are all truths.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2384.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I question everybody out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2386.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How many people that are for or against it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2390.651s">[Scarpelli]</a>: have actually seen what the options are or had any interaction with our city leadership talking, discussing, or teaching them what that vote really means.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2402.453s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's a wide eye-opening example, John, that people can't look at George Scarpelli or Al Medford and say they're liars and they're evil because they don't approve or believe in one organization's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHazMKXpgkg&t=2417.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: vote and have that open mind to really think about it, because it will impact a lot of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=65.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=525.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what we're looking for, so you can explain, yes, Dance, what you were asking for tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=552.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I'd like to help the gentleman, but if we can't ask, I think we should table this until we get further information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=562.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we hate to move forward if we don't, he doesn't understand what we're asking as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=568.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=569.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is your partner coming tonight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=581.048s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, we can put it, can I step aside and maybe call him and does he, does he speak English?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=585.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe I step aside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=586.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=587.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can just move it aside so I can talk to him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=594.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Cause I know what we push this aside a few times and we want to get it forward if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=600.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=992.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, thank you for bringing this forward Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=994.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I did talk to, uh, to, uh, Mr. DiRico and they are in full support of finding other mechanisms to make, to bring this program, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1005.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and make it whole again in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1007.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that being that it isn't part of our agreement, it is a Tufts University policy that they're trying to really move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1018.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that what he did mention that it is one person from Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1022.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one thing that I was happy about that those people that are enrolled right now will still have the full scholarship,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1029.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and we'll finish the program in whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1031.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's a piece that I thought was very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1034.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, some of the people that were enrolled are, I think New Bedford, he mentioned some people out of the country, out of state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1043.839s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's a very diverse group that Tufts offers this program, but you do come across, as he said, Tufts University would love to do everything, but with the process and understanding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1056.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: paid tuition, free tuition, and finding that balance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1060.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's what Tufts is really trying to find to make sure that this moves forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1064.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, again, I don't, what I, the message I received from Morocco is that they are, they will look high and low to make sure that this will continue, but it definitely needs a pause right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1078.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: so they can come back on stronger footing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1081.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, and like again, I said, I know that there is one person from Medford and my biggest fear was if we're cutting this program with that person, not be able to fill what they started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1092.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he said, absolutely not there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1094.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody that's in the program right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1095.436s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think he said it was five that are all going to move forward and all going to finish with the, uh, what they promised with Tufts promise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1103.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2097.98s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can, yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2146.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, President Pierce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2147.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked with our partners from the market and answered all the questions we needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2156.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were some questions that needed to be completed today during one of the process that was brought forward with the health department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2168.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All the documents and everything was signed off today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2171.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So everything is in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2172.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'll move forward for approval, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2177.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, you know, sooner than later, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2240.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2241.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now again, everybody has a platform.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2244.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sure that everybody knows that I am for voting no on the override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2252.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My fellow Councilors are supporting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2254.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, uh, that's not a secret.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2256.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the, the biggest fear as we're going through, uh, respecting to disagree, to disagree for both of our, our, uh, our viewpoints,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2267.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think what's important is that we have to hear what senior citizens are bringing forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2274.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've heard everything from, I think I've talked to maybe 30 senior citizens in the last probably six days, because now the word's starting to get out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2283.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there's so many views that are so confusing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2287.362s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One person said to me that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2290.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: her and her friends that were together at the table said, Councilor Scarpelli, why would you oppose a $7.5 million new high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2299.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a great fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2300.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a great price, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2302.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and the understanding that truly, the residents of the city don't know what is even on these ballots, these ballot questions, because we haven't informed anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2316.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The process stated on both the state site and if you visit other sites that have either passed or failed their overrides, you've seen a robust response<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2330.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: process where there were informative sessions within their community so people were educated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2338.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when they made that choice, they understood the impact in their lives, in their neighbors' lives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2344.553s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that we've done a major disservice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2348.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're actually two weeks away from the start of early voting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2354.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the questions from the most vulnerable people in our community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2359.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I can publicly have said it a thousand times, this group, the financial task force that was put together, came back, we haven't seen minutes, there was no public participation, there was no information session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2373.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's now regulated to people going to the elections office and they're giving them a form that just reads what the override questions are, six, seven, and eight, and that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2387.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and again, I reached out to the director at the Council of Aging, and I asked if there's a possibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2398.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, it doesn't have to be my view.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2400.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It could be Councilor Bears in the yes team and Councilor Scarpelli in the no team, but can we have an information center<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2408.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: at the senior center so we can inform our seniors and we have the director that can reach out to all of our senior citizens in the city whether they own a rent because when you hear the stories of some of these seniors saying geez yeah we i did the calculator but it wasn't right because my house is appraised at 880 000 shame on you i can't believe that you did that but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2434.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when I did the calculations, it said 600,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2438.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so they had questions with the city assessor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2443.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so they came to me about questions about the assessor, about their homes being assessed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2447.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they're not wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2448.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The city assessor doesn't have the true numbers because he's not prepared for this and he wasn't involved in this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2454.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you talk about the ramifications in taxes, we have,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2462.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It goes both ways, because we had someone say, George, is it true I'm going to pay $5,000 more in taxes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2467.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, unless you want a $10 million home in Medford, I don't see that happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2471.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But that's the fear that's true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2473.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's really happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2475.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we do have people that, whether we want to believe it or not,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2479.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They have to make decisions whether $400 a year could impact what medications they're gonna purchase, or if they can travel to see a child, or if they can figure out if they can go out to dinner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2491.663s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's how scared they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2494.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the question was, how do they get there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2496.364s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, I don't know, because we don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2499.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because like I said in the past, I've tried to put through a debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2504.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what I did when I worked with the financial team and the city assessor at the time, they showed us the breakdown with eliminating our most vulnerable residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2513.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's our seniors, our residents with special needs and our military.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2521.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they broke it down for us so you could see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2524.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that was a question I had with the city assessor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2526.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said, when will you have that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2528.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he said, unfortunately, you probably won't see that till the end of October, the true breakdown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2533.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, he, to, to, to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2537.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: move forward with that, the fear that people don't understand that in 2025, these senior citizens homes are going to be assessed again, but not at the 2025 rate of housing, but at 2023, which was a very good year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2553.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that means the homes are going to be a price higher than it really should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2558.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there are so many fear factors in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2560.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to go back to what I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2564.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I talked to the director of the Council of Aging, and she said, unfortunately, I have to run it by the mayor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2572.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Anytime, as a city councilor, I wanted to go to the senior center, I would call and say, I'd like to come down and introduce myself and buy ice cream.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2582.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've probably all done it, and it was never an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2585.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I called the next day and I said, can you please let me know if we can do this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2590.571s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And her words were, unfortunately, the mayor responded and said that we need to get legal representation, whether we can go and sit with our seniors to help them understand what this process is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2604.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, don't get me wrong, there's probably some that are for it, there'll be for it, there's some against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2608.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The problem is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2611.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I hear the word transparency come out of this office and this team, I might vomit because this is totally the opposite of what transparency is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2621.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the total opposite.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2624.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's like bizarro world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2625.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What's transparent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2626.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whatever the opposite is, this is what we've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2630.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, social media loves it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2634.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli never, ever once has said, I don't want an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2639.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'm saying is, first, let's see if we need the override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2644.822s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's publicly work together to figure it out and stakeholders throughout the whole community figure it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2652.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Figure it out, because if you go on these different websites and you look at what override means, so let's say the MTA, they have a great blueprint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2661.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they said, before you go out to do an override, you make sure you get the buy-in from stakeholders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2668.16s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And those stakeholders would be your superintendent, your senior citizens, your business community, your students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2676.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We did nothing of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2677.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what I'm begging this council to do<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2681.423s">[Scarpelli]</a>: join me in asking the mayor to hold a session, hopefully next week together in this chamber as a form of a motion that we hold an information session that seniors can come into this chamber and we can explain what the override is, how we got here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2698.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like again, I'm gonna say it again, in every community that I've researched, and I've done a lot of research on this now, the three most important pieces when you talk about overrides, how did we get there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2710.353s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How are we going to correct it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2712.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what are we going to do so we never have to go there again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2716.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know how we got here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2718.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Although we want to say that, you know, the administration for years past, I don't disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2723.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2724.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done a terrible job in former leaderships to really keep things up to par.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2731.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not disagreeable at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2734.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But where we are today, think about this now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2737.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I tried to explain this to seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2738.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what's scary to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2740.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If on November 5th it's voted in, the process that the mayor has called for, that their taxes will be, you'll see those taxes starting in January of 2025, right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2752.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No time to plan, no time to understand, even that, and I'd love to hear it, it's only $37 a month, it's only $40 a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2759.247s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's farce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2762.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because as homes are being assessed, they're getting taxes higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2766.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As homes are being assessed, CPA taxes are rising.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2770.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As homes are being assessed, you're adding these $40 a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2774.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That, in their new tax bill, it's not $40 a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2778.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To some people, they're looking at four, five, $600 a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2784.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know because I've seen it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2787.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's disingenuous to sit back as a council to say, we're all about affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2792.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're all about making sure that we want to keep residents in their homes and we're going to fight for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2796.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Remember all those buildings that developers are coming in and we had all those people that are wearing buttons and we're all rah-rah-ing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2803.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, we have thousands of those people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2805.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we represent every day that are telling us, stop, because the only outcome for them is going to be selling their home and finding an alternative place to live.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2818.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, in a form of emotion, Mr. President,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2822.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I make the motion that the city council, as a team, ask for an open meeting for all of our senior citizens to have an opportunity before the start of early voting, because as they said, the voting starts, I believe, Tuesday the 16th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2838.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's important that they come and they hear, they get the answers that we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2842.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, again, it might be yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2845.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll have to respect that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2847.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it might be no, and you'll have to respect that, but at least give the seniors an opportunity to understand the impact, to understand the process, because that's the other piece that really bothers a lot of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2863.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can keep going, but I don't want to make it more of a platform than it sounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2867.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I beg my colleagues to vote yes to ask the mayor to open the city council chambers maybe next Wednesday night for the senior citizens to come in and inform them of what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2877.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2904.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2904.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if we can, uh, council bears, if you can ask the mayor to, to allow the director of a council of aging to reach out, to give the opportunity to reach out to all the senior citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2915.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they're informed, um, because a lot of people don't have this platform and don't follow social media and without a newspaper, it's very difficult that they don't know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2924.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we could do that, I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3054.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, then that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3055.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what I'll do is I think the Freedom of Information Act that was presented for information that was gathered through that task force and the emails from the assessor, we could bring it that night so everybody can see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3067.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4288.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, no, it's just an open forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4291.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It could be any member that has a background that can sit and meet with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4296.532s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It could be a override professional from the city or the state that would go in and talk with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4301.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But unfortunately, the mayor mentioned that we need legal representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4510.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4511.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just so I'm clear, so what you brought up earlier, just to be clear, because I want to make sure that I'm not speaking out of turn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4518.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you met with the assessor, but the calculation wasn't part of the assessor's team, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4524.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just so I'm clear with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4526.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The calculation that's being put out by the group that's, the four method group, the four yes group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4541.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not the assessor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4570.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's wonderful, Matt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4571.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the question I had was, because I want to make sure, because the emails that we have, when I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4577.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: speak with the assessors, I don't wanna talk out of turn, because I hate to be called a liar, because that happens a lot lately, that what the assessor's words were, and an email, we'll get it for us, that they had no part of any calculations, and they do not have any of the calculations that normal communities, when they go through an override, they show a breakdown, and the breakdown says,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4604.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: override ramifications or impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4608.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It would be single family homes, two family homes, three family homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4611.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Cause I have the email that states that it will not be ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4615.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those type of calculations that we're seeing didn't come from his office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4619.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just want to make sure when we meet, I don't want anybody to go around saying that this is contentious because I know the calculations and you're correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4628.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's from the state and we understand that, but there's a lot of, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4631.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's a lot of variables<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4634.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that aren't factored because I know firsthand because I sat with a resident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4642.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that the calculations that are out there that state that his house is appraised at X, but is truly Y, it's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4651.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not apples to apples.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4652.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when I talked to the assessor, they said, of course not, because that's not tied in yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4657.159s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just want you to know that we wanna make sure when we come to the 15th that we're not spending too much time looking at or talking about, oh yeah, I'll tell him the truth, I'm not telling the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4666.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just wanna make sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4668.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The assessor was not part of any calculations with any financial group of task force here in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4675.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's their exact words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4676.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4685.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, that's not minutiae.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4720.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So not the newest ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5360.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5368.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Next we have item 24-476, resolution to support question two, replacing the high stakes MCAS test graduation requirements for high school students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5380.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council President Baez.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5390.18s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I think this is, it's very powerful when you read it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5502.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: See, I'm already voting with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5507.574s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So powerful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5509.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5695.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, anyone else I just, as I think accounts of as they can scale and hope people sitting down out there is that but I'll be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5704.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm behind you 1000% with this initiative, I think as a former teacher, until you're sitting in a classroom, and you're working with a dedicated teacher who's bawling her eyes out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5715.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because you have a new ESL student that just moved to the city, to this country weeks ago, and that you have to try to explain to them what snow is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5726.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And knowing that impact, that it'll never succeed, and watching the pain, and realize that these are the questions that are leading decisions to what we're looking at as educators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5744.289s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I love the fact that I was a strong advocate for the portfolio format, where you really saw the growth of a student from beginning to end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5756.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it made teachers, what we saw, it happened right in front of us, you took away the creativity away from teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5764.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you took away so much talent because instead of them being creative to this individual student, individual classes, they had to focus on what this test forced you to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5776.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's been a long time coming, like you said, the graduation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5780.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My daughter Gianna, she is a Dean's List student, 4.0 student in college, 3.5 in high school, had the most difficult time passing the MCAS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5794.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I saw it firsthand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5795.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A young lady that had to fight a speech impediment and understanding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5803.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what the limitations that you have as a teacher to help a student with a disability is another most painful process to watch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5811.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I agree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5814.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope we can go a step further and moving forward this initiative further to look at maybe using testing as one mechanism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5822.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but also followed up with some sort of portfolio process where you can really see our kids shine and our teachers shine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5829.92s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would, I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5833.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So do we have any questions on Zoom?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5835.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It looks like Julie, oops, Julie Roberto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5851.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5852.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Name and address for the record<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5933.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Next we have at the podium name and address of the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5936.822s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have 33 minutes and three days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6325.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6326.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We do have Mr. Cassinetti.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6330.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have name and address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6331.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have your... Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6340.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have to unmute, Mr. Cassinetti.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6345.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yep, you're good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6369.233s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6511.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6511.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, to follow up with that council president bears, I think that when MCAS started the biggest issue with the teachers, where the teachers weren't really involved, it was politicians and bureaucrats was it, and there was a huge gap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6524.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, so I think now you're seeing, um, hopefully waking up and, you know, look at different options when we're assessing our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6533.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So on the motion council bears second by council Callahan, uh, Mr. Clerk,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6540.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6541.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6543.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How's that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6572.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, seven, the affirmative zero and the negative motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6577.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can I take this home for my wife?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6578.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can Dina, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6581.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's so powerful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1393.264s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1479.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1834.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, President Beas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1837.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I did take some time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1839.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I contacted our code enforcement officer and like we thought, Panda Express is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1846.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: has done a great job with everything they do and above board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1851.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we really appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1852.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as I went through and talked to some neighbors, I think there's gotta be some consistency with our decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1862.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We voted to keep the permit, the hours of operations for Raising Cane, Dave's Hot Chicken,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1872.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then we have the wings wing stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1875.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think all of those restaurants and those establishments have a schedule from 11 o'clock to 11 11 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1884.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to 11 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1884.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and I think that we've heard for some neighbors that live directly across the street and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1893.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and that there are some residents in that area, unfortunately, directly across the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1898.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I wouldn't be able to support a special permit at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1903.169s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that under the umbrella of being consistent, respecting our neighbors and the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1914.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: past outcomes and decisions that we made for local establishments that are in that vicinity, I would recommend that we do not support a special permit at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1926.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2763.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you Councilor Bears, Councilor President Bears, and thanks Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2766.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's time to bring this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2769.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For someone who does manage this type of facility in neighboring communities, I think it's going to be important to get the cost analysis because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2781.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, community in financial crisis, as we are right now, looking at Porter parties at a lot of our facilities could be very, very, very expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2790.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, what would be what would be, uh, what we've done in, uh, in, in to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2798.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: hold the burden off our constituents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2801.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We kind of maybe want to look into neighboring city facilities that we can use in different areas instead of the port-a-potties in different locations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2815.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that might be something interesting to see if we could set up a map or a partnership with city facilities that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2821.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: residents that are using a certain park or location that they can use those sanitation facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2828.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, I will tell you it is a a huge expense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2833.719s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, it's a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2834.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And like I said, um, when we look at apples to apples that are coming up pretty soon, it's something that's gonna be interesting to see where we're going to tighten our belts as a city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2845.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2991.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3798.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3799.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3801.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I very well put Councilor Callahan, but to further to expound on the free cash is the essential, the amount of money communities have over-budgeted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3814.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And according to the Mass General Department of Revenue, free cash represents the amount of community funds that are unrestricted and avail of appropriation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3822.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For example, the city of Medford has not had a city solicitor for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3827.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that money would carry over year after year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3831.379s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Every year a salary from the city solicitor includes annual budget, because no one is receiving the salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3836.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The amounts of that, if we put aside, city solicitor's salary goes into the city's free cash reserve for the city administration, the mayor, to use as they please if they need so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3847.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So how does the community use its free cash?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3850.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Cities and towns in Massachusetts use free cash after it's certified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3853.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The Mass Department of Revenue is responsible for certifying free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3857.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: After a city or town submits its financial information to the Department of Revenue, a community will receive its notification, the total amount of free cash, which is certified, therefore available for appropriation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3869.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, does Medford have free cash?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3872.088s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3873.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Medford has free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3874.73s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As of September 10th, we were looking at a total of about $34 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3880.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is certified free cash, which means it's available to use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3884.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And especially in crises when you talk about underfunding a $5 million deficit in the school department, that's what that money could be used for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3893.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then with the vision of financial minds working together to see if there are other avenues that we should use other than overrides, I feel it would be prudent for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3907.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So most communities, the four and 5% that's been mentioned, most communities,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3913.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you see a two to maybe $3 million of free cash after every budget year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3919.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, you've consistently seen with this administration an absurd amount of money going into free cash because revenues were under projected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3929.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And maybe that's done for a reason, or maybe not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3933.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's something that we would love to know with more transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3937.088s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, this community, our community, our leadership team,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3942.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: haven't done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3943.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it leads us down a very, very slippery slope and it's dividing this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3948.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So while we have the free cash and have the opportunity to not put the fear mongering into the community about teacher cuts or school issues or our children, why not use the free cash and eliminate those fears and then sit down like we talked about in the past where I was shut down by this council to look at a more, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3970.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: transparent, open form of participation to see where we need to do these three things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3976.698s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One understanding how the city got to this financial situation to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3981.963s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How are we going to fix it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3983.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And three, what are we doing never to see this ever again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3987.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this council and this mayor and this administration haven't done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3991.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to ask for an override right now is just absolutely frightening, especially to the homeowners that are living on a fixed income that we're looking at possibly losing their homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4001.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So in the same vein as my fellow councilor asked to vote for the override, I'm going to implore to our residents that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4010.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is two different cases, two different stories, and it's going to be important so people can understand the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4017.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the truth is, the city has mismanaged its budgets and mismanaged its organization in the city for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4028.221s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we see this with a $9 million certified free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4035.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That is unheard of, my friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4037.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So yes, it is true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4039.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you do take money out of free cash, it could possibly hurt your bond rating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4044.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when you have $34 million, taking $5 million out to make sure our schools and our children have no fear of what might happen down the line, why wouldn't we do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4057.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4093.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, if I can, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4097.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I couldn't get my hand up fast enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4099.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can we sever this, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4100.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I think with the financial questions we have in our community, I would support the traffic motion, but I think that we would have to look at this separate piece as something we can hold off until after the override vote is taken because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4121.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we are in fiscal crisis and this vote is taken in November and it's voted down, this could be crucial money to assist for the fraudulent process that was put forth to us where we hear all these cuts going to be made in the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4137.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would request we would sever this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4139.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in a motion and then uh and really think twice before we vote on any money paper right now um dealing with um dealing with uh with any any project that doesn't have to do with safety or our children seniors so thank you that's a formal motion thank you sever is there a second on the motion to sever<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4528.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=19.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right now, for the November 5th ballot, we'll have question six, question seven, question eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=28.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Question six is a debt exclusion, like I explained, is a tax that you'll be taxed until the project or the bond is complete, and then it comes off the tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=40.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that reads,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=43.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That exclusion on fire station shall the city of Medford be allowed to exempt from the provisions of proposition two and a half, so-called the amounts required to pay for the bonds issued in order to pay for costs of construction, a new fire station headquarters to be located at 120 Main Street in Medford, including the payment of all costs related design, the project equipping and furnishing, the project site improvements and all other costs<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=72.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: incidental to related there too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=78.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you'll vote no, because that's been a lot of people's questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=82.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: George, I thought you supported the firefighters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=85.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, when you hear it straight from the people that I think Danielle put it perfectly when she said, we don't want to sound like the angry people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=96.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Instead, look to see what our firefighters have gone through, what our men and women have gone through in the last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=103.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and how they've been treated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=105.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And yet again, they're gonna stand up and say what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=109.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What you're offering was not transparent, was not inclusive, was a decision made in a box, and the funding is gonna hurt our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=122.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they're willing to stand up and say what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=126.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'd rather not have our residents of Medford hurt<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=132.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: financially for an inferior product.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=136.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please do not vote for question six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=141.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Danielle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=148.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Question seven is funding schools and street repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=155.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Shall the city of Medford be allowed to assess an additional 3.5 million in real estate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=161.368s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and personal property taxes for FY25 general operations of the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=167.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $3 million includes but not limited to funding costs for teachers, literacy coaches, behavior specialists, administrative assistants, nurses, and for regular facility maintenance and for FY25 general operations DPW, including but not limited<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=188.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to additional staff for road and sidewalk infrastructure repair for fiscal year beginning July 1, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=196.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, this question seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=202.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $500,000, come on, for the roads and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=207.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: ARPA, when it was originally put forth, was directly supposed to go to infrastructure needs, roads and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=220.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=222.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now we sit here and say we're going to give them $500.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=225.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=227.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is an issue that I put forth years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=230.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We tried to put a sidewalk and hot tub crew together to save the city money because the mayor kept coming to us for $2.5 million bonds for sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=242.258s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we never saw sidewalks being done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=244.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We could never catch up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=246.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know my colleagues say, see?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=248.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: See?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=248.78s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=249.16s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have no money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=250.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=252.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=254.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I love the dialogue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=261.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Public schools, teachers, literacy coaches, behavior specialists, nurses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=270.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The superintendent has already, the expert in the state has shared some amazing information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=280.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have we been resourceful?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=283.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Has the school committee and the school department been resourceful in creating revenue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=290.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=293.223s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know my colleagues will say, again, he's not telling the truth because their social media sites tell you that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=301.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I have shown everyone, very simple, meeting after meeting, and if you want to look up, watch them on YouTube,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=309.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: From step to step, we showed an avenue to come out of this without hurting kids or teachers or schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=318.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We showed them that avenue through free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=322.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what did they do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=325.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They imposed a rule to shut me up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=329.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=332.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One of our members got a phone call from a school kid member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=337.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that school kid member said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=339.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How dare you put a no sign on your lawn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=345.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are you going to be happy when we lay off 40 teachers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=348.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Shame on that person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=351.429s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because that's the same exact question I posed in the open meeting in front of everybody and said, why put the schools, the children, the teachers through this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=362.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Take the $5 million out of free cash,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=366.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: put the fear away, and then let's all get to the table and make the right decision for our community with an open and transparent process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=378.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that, ladies and gentlemen, question seven, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=391.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I like the drama behind this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=394.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Question eight's intense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=396.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=397.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So question eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=399.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This override will expand vocational programs and increase student access to the arts by giving us the funding to pay for new programming, staff to help students succeed, fix the school schedule at the level and increase educator and paraprofessional compensation to ensure living in competitive wages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=420.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Doesn't that sound expensive?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=422.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Vocational.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=423.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe what it is, Roy, you can help me if I'm wrong, is expanding the day, the school day, and the vocational day would kind of merge together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=435.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what we're asking for, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=440.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe it's maybe through negotiations will be the biggest cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=446.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, what we're looking at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=449.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is nothing close to $4 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=452.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not even close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=453.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not even close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=456.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Understand the trend here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=459.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Six, we heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=460.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Seven and eight, education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=463.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Understand every single community that has fought for an override in their communities has used what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=471.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the children, and the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=474.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Don't hurt our children, don't hurt our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=478.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I asked my colleagues, and we've heard people on the other side that's supporting this, where were you the meeting that you shut me up when we asked for free cash that we had?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=493.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you were there, and you still have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=498.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So let's understand this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=501.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now that you know the questions, let's go all the way back now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=506.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And let's make sure we get this and people can hear it, you can share it with your friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=512.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All Medford, at no time have we ever said, we're against an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=519.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We do not want it, never.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=521.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was never said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=525.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=527.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: was let's fix what's wrong now with that $5 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=531.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's bring everybody together to the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=534.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's have an open and transparent process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=537.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And let's work together to make sure we, if the need is there, that we fulfill it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=545.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And don't divide the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=548.764s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is what has happened now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=550.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now we're dividing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=552.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now it's yes or no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=553.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll be honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=556.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a responsible member of this community, if I didn't think now that we're here, there's nothing we can do, we'd have to step away, I'd step away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=565.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we have $34 million in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=569.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $34 million in free cash that has not been used that can recover this funding and make sure that we do this process correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=579.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=582.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And for those who don't know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=586.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just a quick step-by-step so you understand it's never quick with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=591.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had our budget meeting last year, the year before last.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=596.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And my colleagues were in unison, Councilor Caraviello was there, Council President Beas was there, and we were all together in the process that we cannot support this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=610.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's too dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=612.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we were all for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=616.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Until the night of the meeting, Councilor Caraviello and I stood there, and our council leadership team came out and said, hey, we just met with the mayor behind closed doors, and we're gonna vote for the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=630.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've come to an agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=631.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What agreement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=634.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't know what agreement it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=635.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Caraviello and Councilor Knight didn't know what agreement it was, but there was some sort of agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=640.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, as this grew, we kind of realized what the agreement was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=644.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A financial task force was created.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=649.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A school kid member, two city Councilors, the chief of staff, and the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=657.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Five people with no background in financial battles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=664.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=666.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At least not enough to lead us to the spot we need to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=672.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=673.65s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This financial task force is meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=675.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't hear anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=676.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are no minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=677.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's no information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=679.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're told we're going to get in a meeting before we do anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=684.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, you hear rumblings, so we call for a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=688.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have our city council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=691.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe it was the week before we had a subcommittee meeting, and a very smart red<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=700.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They said, so if you ask for an override and it doesn't pass, what does that mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=708.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That means devastation for the school department and our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=714.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Imagine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=716.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I came back the following week and I presented a plan that said what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=723.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Use our free cash, let's come to the table and do the right thing for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=729.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and let's not leverage our kids in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=735.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But guess what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=738.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's called Rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=739.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council Scarpelli shut down, can't speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=746.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is how we're getting messages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=748.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The Financial Task Force's plan was an override plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=752.11s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was what they came out with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=754.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We asked for the minutes, we asked for more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=756.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How did we get there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=757.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who was involved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=758.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=761.274s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now maybe the other side, because my friends are telling me, George, they're beating you up, they're beating you up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=765.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=767.78s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is all true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=769.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is all on tape.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=774.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, typical fashion, Friday we get emails from the mayor's office with $7.5 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=785.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Tuesday we come to a meeting, we're gonna vote on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=789.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a responsible city councilor, I will now invoke our Rule 21, close the meeting, and ask for an open meeting with everybody to talk about this in more depth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=802.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something that's unheard of, has never been heard of, never been done before, but our council leadership suspends the rules of the meeting and imposes a vote to not invoke Rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=819.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Done, you can't talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=820.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you, the council had five subcommittee meetings to talk about a city council newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=828.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=830.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And guess what that, that's free, nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=834.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But, the paper's adding up to $7.5 million and possibly more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=841.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They don't wanna talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=842.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, what do we do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=844.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We move on to the next meeting and I said, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=846.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I reach out to my state representative and I asked him, what is the plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=850.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What can I do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=851.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they said, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=852.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Legal from the state said you can now invoke Mass General Law 43, section 22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=859.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That supersedes any method rule, shuts the meeting down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=863.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, we get to the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=866.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our leadership team does the same exact thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=869.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Suspends the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=871.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Imposed, says they cannot impose rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=874.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I then invoke section 22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=879.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council leadership says, no, you can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=884.437s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Against the rule, against the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=888.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because what was gonna be said is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=893.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And listen closely, because this is how real communities do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=897.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In 2009, working in the city of Somerville, Mayor Joe Curtatone was at a crossroads with his community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=905.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Big cuts looming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=907.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He convenes a group, a working group, a financial working group that consisted of financial minds from Tufts, MIT, Harvard, banking leaders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=920.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You had the Sloans from Century Bank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=925.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You had his financial team present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=928.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You had community leaders and business leaders all in a row.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=932.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they worked on a plan because they said you needed to figure out three things before you wanted to go to an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=938.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One, how do we get there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=942.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still don't know how we got here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=945.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At least publicly, there's nothing been mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=948.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Two, how do we fix it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=951.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Three, how does this never happen again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=955.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what we were taught.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=958.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, they came out and they said, okay, this is what we're going to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=961.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to look at traffic and parking fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=963.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not going to make people happy, but they're going to take that money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=965.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're going to increase those fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=967.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're going to take that money, and that's going to be dedicated solely to the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=973.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Boom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=974.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Need taken away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=976.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=978.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need streets and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=980.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How do we figure that out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=982.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The focus is fees and fines for trash and building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=988.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And boom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=989.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Developers pay for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=992.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then the third piece, the most important piece, they sat together and they said, well, what can we do so this never happens again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=998.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How do we bring Somerville out of this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1001.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, they started this little project called Assembly Row.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1006.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now, whether you like it or not, there's a lot of money coming into the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1012.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, maybe you might question the growth, maybe question how they got there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1016.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not what I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1017.794s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'm saying is, that was an open process<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1021.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with financial minds that sat together to find a solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1027.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What has happened here, both in the fire department and the school department, it's been done in a vacuum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1035.316s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nobody knows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1038.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that a member of the community did file a FOIA request asking information for, we're waiting on that, hopefully we get that soon, that we can share with the community of what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1050.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: was shared, minutes, any notes, anything taken with this financial group?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1056.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who were the professionals they might have brought in that we don't know that could have helped them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1059.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nobody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1061.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here we are today, middle of September, people still don't know that there's an override vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1070.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like Councilor Caraviello said, he had explained to a person yesterday, why are we fighting it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1075.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $7.5 million for a new high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1077.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1081.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1083.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1087.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So people are saying, you know, but, you know, Councilor Scarpelli shouldn't be doing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1091.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's a city councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1092.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't give a shit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1098.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm going to fight for what I think is right so every citizen is heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1102.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I will tell you, it's not that I'm new to this, or I wouldn't do this, or I wouldn't have the guts to do something like this, because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1110.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were three former Councilors in this room, and only one of them, sorry Rick, only one of them put forth a debt exclusion that was probably put together by the best financial mind in Medford, an Aleesha Nunley, and we looked at the process of creating funding for a new main fire station on Main Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1134.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it was so simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1136.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We would exclude senior citizens because you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1139.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're hurting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1141.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Senior citizens are hurting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1145.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The vulnerable community, our disabled, our veterans, eliminate that group, those groups, and see what we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1154.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe at the time it was $17 a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1158.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We could swallow that, couldn't we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1160.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But that was with the process that gets started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1162.763s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even with this process right now, nobody knows what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1166.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still don't know what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1168.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing's been posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1170.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know there's rumblings that money's already being spent from free cash out of $34 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1177.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing's been done yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1180.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So having this meeting tonight is so important, this fundraiser's so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1184.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I tell you, I gotta thank so many people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1188.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The restaurants that donated,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1190.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: LaCasha's, Ronnie's Place, Richie Razzo's from Razzo's and Avellino's always donate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1197.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1201.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The thousands of dollars that were donated just the other day was amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1209.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And guess where that money's coming from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1212.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1214.268s">[Scarpelli]</a>: hard-working, method residents that want to do anything they can and fight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1219.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My neighbor, who's 84 years old, came to my house today and said, George, I can't come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1225.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He has $8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1231.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, God, no, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1234.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I tell you, what we do know is Kelly has done a great job with the real estate side and understanding the assessing side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1241.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have Nate Merritt's been doing his deep dive into the calculator that they have on their site that says all you do is poke in these numbers, bam, it's always this much money, you can handle that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1255.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Bullshit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1258.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I'm gonna tell you straight up, $380 for a person might sound not a lot of money, but some of the people I've talked to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1269.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I keep saying it, I won't use her last name, but I love her dearly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1272.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see Mrs. Jones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1274.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She said, George, help me understand this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1277.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I bought my house 50, 60 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1281.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So $48,000, I believe she said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1283.582s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think I tell people $50,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1286.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But now my house is worth a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1290.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My husband died 15 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1292.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was a seamstress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1294.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My social security doesn't cover my taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1298.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So should I move?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1300.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Some people want them to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1302.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I haven't heard one thing supporting our senior citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1306.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I haven't heard one thing how we're gonna help those homeowners that are struggling to stay in their homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1311.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Cuz one of my council colleagues actually said to me is, if your house is worth a million dollars, just take a hundred out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1318.663s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1320.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The understanding of not understanding what a home equity line is, that's devastating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1326.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Devastating for a resident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1329.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're not candy coating anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1332.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not hiding anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1333.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything you see has been public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1337.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have told my council colleagues what they're doing is dangerous to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1343.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still don't see the information how we got here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1346.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The way they want to get out of it is by taxing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1348.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Here's the other piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1350.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hey, it's only this much money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1353.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I hear that again from people, I'm going to lose my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1356.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because understand this, and I'll end with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1360.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What did we talk about one of our first meetings subcommittee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1363.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Rent control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1365.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then we talked about a transfer tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1368.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then we talked about a registry fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1370.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we talked about overrides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1376.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it stops there, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1377.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1379.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because my brother, I'll use my brother for example, just got his house assessed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1385.096s">[Scarpelli]</a>: An additional $400 a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1389.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, he's a young man, works very hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1392.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hopefully, he can recover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1395.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But then, Kelly did some homework, and we found out his assessment in 20 to 24 that's starting now, he thinks it's over with the assessment side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1406.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But Kelly, what are we hearing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1407.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In 2025, you're gonna get the sales data for 2023, because the peak of the real estate market will pass your home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1419.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's going up again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1421.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So have we heard any of that in their homework?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1424.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1426.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it's only $400.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1428.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But let's go a step further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1432.33s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A minimum $200 million renovated high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1437.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who fits that bill?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1439.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1441.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We want a new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1443.477s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A new one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1444.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Take it down to one new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1446.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Looking at $400 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1449.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You people don't understand what that number equates to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1454.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1456.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's scary and it's dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1460.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I didn't want to bring you out to scare you, but I brought you out to wake you up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1465.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This group never wanted to say no to an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1469.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we heard it from the smartest educational mind that I've been around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1476.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we haven't seen enough creativity, we haven't seen enough information, and there has been no transparency to show that we need this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1488.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've talked to our fire department, our firefighters are saying, don't hurt our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1494.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Don't build something just to check a box.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1498.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't want the fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1501.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1503.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if they're saying it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1506.792s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I've spelt it out for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1509.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a very simple process right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1514.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Fix the budget with $5 million in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1518.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's move forward and think of different ways to be creative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1521.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's be shocking and look at new growth and development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1526.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something we haven't seen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1527.922s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Am I lying, Ricky?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1531.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How many 40B jobs did we lose?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1533.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Three, how much money just in permits with those three projects?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1538.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Millions of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1539.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then tax revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1541.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've done the homework on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1542.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How much?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1543.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $16 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1543.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's one building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1544.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, these aren't lies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1546.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are true numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1547.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, you wish you had a platform<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1562.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I've been shut up way too easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1565.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, in this forum, I'm not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1566.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you're my voice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1567.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're helping us spread the message now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1570.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1572.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a list right now of over 600 volunteers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1576.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 600 volunteers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1580.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have captains that are going to be doing standouts that we have about, what, 60 to 80 people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1586.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 60 to 80 people already signed up to do standouts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1591.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm asking all of you, October 15th, Zach, if you wanna come on out, we're gonna meet at Hormel Stadium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1598.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody's gonna come out and we're gonna take our message and we're gonna go to the neighborhoods and we're gonna knock on doors and we're gonna give people the information that no one in the city has given them to help them understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1610.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Understand the rest of everybody else, don't be afraid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1613.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If a school kid member knocks on your door, it's a shame on you beyond that you have the information right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1620.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: beyond that you know the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1626.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So tomorrow, when you go to the coffee shop, or tomorrow when you go next door and you talk to Dave and have a cold drink, sit down with him and say, hey, do you know about the overrides?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1636.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the fire don't want it, the educational minds think it's absurd, and it's going to hurt people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1645.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here's the other piece that I seem to forget, and I don't ever want to forget this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1652.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have lived in a, grew up in a home with tenants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1655.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My dad made sure that we treated our tenants with pride and with respect, and we made sure we kept our rent reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1663.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the fact that my brother took that, and we still have the same family there that have been there for 10 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1670.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That family pays for a four bedroom in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1673.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They pay $2,400.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1673.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Pretty cheap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1676.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We all know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1677.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He will not raise that rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1680.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What people have to understand, if these taxes come about, taxpayers cannot handle this on their own.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1689.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's going to be passed down to the tenants, and renters are going to go through the roof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1696.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I want to thank all of you for coming out tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1700.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did I miss anything, Rick?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1701.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are you sure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1702.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's my captain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1703.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Rick's going to tell me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1705.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, again, I will tell you,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1707.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've got great people working on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1709.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm so excited for the energy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1712.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right now, we have 260 signs already on the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1716.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Steve's gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1717.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have 260 signs on the street, and we have another 200 here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1723.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Make sure you take your sign, but make sure you leave your name and your address so we know you've taken it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1730.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And show your neighbors and just give us a call, just so people know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1735.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: An override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1737.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you vote for an override and we give the mayor $6 million, even though they say that the money is going to go to the vocational school or art programs, that's not necessarily true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1753.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The money goes into the general fund to be used to the mayor's discretion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1758.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so again, there's a reason why we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1763.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $9 million<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1768.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1770.183s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those people that want to know real simple what free cash is, free cash is the money that we approve for the prior year in the budget that the mayor does not use, does not spend, and then it gets certified and carried over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1784.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then it goes into an account that she can do anything she wants with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1790.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1792.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I hope tonight what we really wanted to do is educate some people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1798.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: bring them out, have them know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1801.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Understand that we'll be having, if you please sign up for the standouts, we'll be doing door knocking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1807.666s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the big one is gonna be October 15th, Saturday, nine o'clock at Formell Stadium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1814.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna be meeting there and we're all gonna be hitting the streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1818.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna be going into the neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1820.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna be knocking on the doors, talking to your neighbors and letting them know that if this is voted through, it's not gonna hurt the children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1828.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor's just gonna have to put the money that she's playing with back to where it's supposed to be and help our children and help our schools and help our seniors and our residents so they don't get killed with these taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1841.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, thank you all for coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1843.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have a safe ride home and we'll talk to you soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QjAOAB8_UUg&t=16.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm honored that a friend of ours who's worked so hard for firefighters to capture grants and take the pressure off our citizens and our tax base, Secretary for our union, Danielle Marcelino is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QjAOAB8_UUg&t=31.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Welcome, Danielle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QjAOAB8_UUg&t=251.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=15.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Tonight, we have to thank my team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=18.945s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's so many of them, but I want to thank everybody that's here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=21.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you're from all Medford, if you could just raise your hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=23.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just thanking you for being here tonight and helping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=26.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=31.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've had a few events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=32.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know tonight's a tough, tough night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=33.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we had about three different events tonight, but we said we need to do something because things are happening really quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=42.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the reason that we're here is because we wanted to talk about the Proposition 2.5 override and the debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=48.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there are three questions that will be on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=52.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll give you some more information later on after a few people speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=58.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But one is the debt exclusion, which is for a new fire headquarters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=66.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm very fortunate that we have one of our union leaders from the fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=71.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Danielle Masolino is going to be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=72.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's going to speak in a little while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=74.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And proud to say someone that I called and asked his opinion because I think he is probably<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=82.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the smartest educational mind, at least in Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=87.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's someone that I respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=89.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And sad to say, I don't think people respect him enough until that person's gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=94.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I called this gentleman and I asked him some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=99.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And within five minutes, you just feel better because he just educates you with his knowledge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=105.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I asked him if he can come out and spend a Friday night to come out and speak and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=111.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: give his opinion and what, you know, his perspective as an educational leader, someone that ran our school system for many, many years, still works at the state level, high level at the state, and he's gonna share some of his knowledge, and then we'll fill in some gaps that people had that had some questions, and we can help educate everybody so they understand what this means on November 7th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=134.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So right now, I'd like to introduce my friend Roy Belson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=4162.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=402.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=403.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, it seems like I do this way too often when we talk about Medford residents that leave an impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=413.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Medford lost one of their favorite sons, Frank Zizzo,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=420.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Frank leaves behind his amazing wife, Dorothy, and his children, Frankie Jr., Kerry, and son, Tyler.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=428.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that a great family man, loves his grandchildren.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=433.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you watch, follow him on Facebook, you realize what kind of an amazing person he is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=438.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Grandfather, father, and Method Mustang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=444.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He dedicated his life to make sure that kids in our community got what they needed, especially at the hockey rink when it came to Medford Youth Hockey, and especially when it wasn't that popular, our female youth, our female girls program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=460.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He really helped build that program and Medford is sad,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=467.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for his loss and really would like to send our deepest condolences to the Zizo family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=473.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he's the type of person that has left a legacy that not too many people will forget if you knew him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=480.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And those who didn't should ask about him because it's someone that you want to, you want to remember or at least know his name because he's that, he was that much of an impactful person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=492.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=496.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=537.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=538.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that with so much, so much devastation happening across the world, we seem to sometimes forget the pain and suffering that we felt here in our country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=551.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: back in 2001.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=552.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's a day that everybody will remember where they were and left such an impact in everybody's lives that we should never forget September 11, 2001.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=562.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=567.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what that did to society and what it did to our world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=570.297s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And remember all those people that perished that day and beyond because of the cleanup and you see the frontline workers that are passing now that worked on the rubble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=588.666s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's an impact that we still feel today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=590.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that we should never forget that day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=592.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, and, uh, it's something that I'd make the motion for a moment of silence for this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=597.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1954.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can open it and then I could fill in the blanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1996.584s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1998.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Three o'clock in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2000.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, that's not happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2002.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will, I will tell you, I think that when you look at the neighbors, unfortunately you do a butt neighbors, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2007.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Across the street, you have, you have families and homes across the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2011.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, I think we can be very fair to look at what we've done historically for neighboring businesses with the idea of competition and fairness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2023.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will, Council President, I did ask for a report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2027.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I haven't heard back from the building office for inspections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2032.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm actually gonna ask to move this to a date certain, but I wanted to make sure we spoke<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2038.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: tonight because I wanted to get a report back to see if we've had any concerns or issues in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2044.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that it's important that we understand that, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2050.509s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Three o'clock in the morning is a little excessive and I think that that's when you're looking at what neighboring restaurants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2057.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we've given some permits or some options till I believe one o'clock in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2062.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But after that, I don't as one counts I would never entertain if people want that late late hours for anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2070.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For consumption, I think they can go into a business district and outside the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2076.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think any resident, to be honest with you, this councilor, the three o'clock is just unreasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2082.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why we have the special permit in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2084.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we have a week to revisit it, to be honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2089.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the latest we have is one o'clock in the morning for some restaurants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2094.313s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, even that to me is a little questionable because you are across the street from some homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2099.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's something I'll have to really think of before I make my vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2105.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that before we do anything this evening, I'm going to ask to, after everybody adds any information or questions they have, but I'll be looking to move this to get a report back from the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2120.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the building department to see with any complaints or issuances that have happened in that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2126.93s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not just your location, I'm not saying your location did anything wrong, I'm asking to see what's happening in that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2132.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they haven't, unfortunately, they're a little undermanned, and so no one got back to me in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2138.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So hopefully we get an answer, and then next meeting we'll have a clearer vision of what I can vote on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2146.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I thank you for being here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2500.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that the biggest issues we have is that when they do open the streets, not just, not your company, but we're seeing too many, too many jobs that are left half done, and it's creating more havoc when people leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2516.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think the biggest piece is having a curb-to-curb process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2521.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's something that, to me, as one councilor, is a non-negotiable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2527.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But from what I, just for clarification,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2531.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we saying that the roads that we're requesting, they will be paved curb to curb, but we're asking for other streets that are impacted to be repaved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2546.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just need some clarification on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2669.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, I too am a little leery of,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2673.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: of the impact that this will make not only for the increased costs that would be then put on our ratepayers within the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2685.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that because National Grid's not going to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2687.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not going to take it on the chin, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2688.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, it's going to be passed off somewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2691.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as I'm looking at it online, where we're looking at South Street and traversing down Main Street, I know exactly what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2701.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That median was already developed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2704.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was in front of the police station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2707.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that where?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2708.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's already been done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2711.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I could see your apprehension with that going across the street of the medium, because if I can ask the city engineer in this map and taking this route, even today, I didn't see, it didn't seem to be uneven or really damaged in that area on the other side of the medium anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2741.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: where we're seeing the work being done down South Street and all the way down Main Street, that is a no brainer of curb to curb, but that's something that I'd have to consider now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2754.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3668.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4161.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I thank Councilor Leming to look into this, but I think we need to be very careful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4166.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Neighborhood communities have looked at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4170.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the vision of development without a full comprehensive plan, and it's a good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4175.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it has to be looked at, but I think we better be careful in what, in totality, what we're doing in this community when you're looking for development and what we're asking for developers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4187.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're seeing impacts in neighboring communities where they had some similar issues and they thought would be great ideas, and instead what they did is they further pushed developers further away from the communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4199.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4200.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It really hurt neighboring communities with the fact that neighboring communities lost millions of dollars because of their processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4208.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think this is something that, you know, when Mayor McGlynn put this in place, he had the foresight to look at this and say, this is what we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4219.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why they set up a trust for each, how do they put it, that each,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4227.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: each stakeholder that within the city that would be impacted, the impacted departments, which would have been, I believe the school department, parks and recreation, DPW, water and sewer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4272.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4273.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I stand to say it was road and traffic, road and traffic linkage, parks and recreation linkage, police and fire linkage, water and sewer linkage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4283.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that the other question people had was this, are we going to be looking at small development of someone who was refurbishing their home or adding an addition?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4292.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, no, it would be for... This wouldn't change what linkage currently applies to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4298.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4298.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It would be with the special... Is it special...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4303.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: site plan review correct okay all right so i just like i said i think that uh understanding the history was important and i think that it does need to be looked at but i think that we should be very careful and you know without a real comprehensive plan that at least i haven't seen in what direction this city's going and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4324.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when it's growth and development, I think it's a little dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4327.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5064.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5065.526s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you very much for all your work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5066.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think these are the revenue generating projects that we're talking about and that the city can really use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5076.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And like we said, we're starting with one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5079.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as we see it starting to increase, I think it'll be important that we stay ahead of the kilowatt rate for the fact that we're seeing national grid never saw us<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5093.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're climbing at an outrageous rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5096.311s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So in making sure that we're competitive, but at the same time, we're offering something for convenience for our residents and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5108.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To be honest with you, I'm sure the gaps that people that are driving down 93 that need a charge, the nearest site comes right into Medford, right off the highway, and they use our station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5119.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I wouldn't mind that someone from a different community, a different state that needs to be charged, they come into Medford and help us with our bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5128.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5499.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Director Dickinson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5500.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5501.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5502.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5503.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is common practice, by the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5506.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Every municipality does this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5507.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's good practice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5514.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5520.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, I think that's a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5522.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For people to understand, I think that someone asked me a question, what does that mean, George?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5526.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, simply put,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5528.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you had your mortgage and it extended so long, you can revisit it with a better rate and rewrite that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5537.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's that simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5545.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're talking about bonds, it's a lot of money if we could save a percentage point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5548.719s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So yeah, I think this is good work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5563.258s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a teacher for the next 10 years or a police officer or a firefighter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5566.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5568.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate you had worked with that and I would support this, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5572.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=831.766s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, just we change the ownership, everything is same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4455.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4456.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that you've worked very hard on this, but a lot of people have still reached out saying they just don't know, since we've moved some places around, they were curious how they can really know where they're supposed to vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4468.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is there a number or an office that I can direct them to and that we can maybe send something out publicly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4523.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a great idea if we can get like a robocall to those residents to say, don't forget your new location or there's a lot of people it's funny because conversations that we have a big state state representative Donato has a big.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4538.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: big race coming up in September, September 3rd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4542.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And a lot of people are really coming back out that haven't voted since the last presidential race.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4547.429s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's where the questions arose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4550.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate that, if we can get that word out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4553.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think the other thing was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4555.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that with that race, is it district, Middlesex District?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4561.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 35, what is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4565.223s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We really, I think the other question is that people don't know that September is the election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4572.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There is no November with this race, because there isn't a Republican, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4576.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There will be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4598.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the two will go in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4600.695s">[Scarpelli]</a>: OK, that's confusing, because now we were told that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4643.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4644.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I understand that, but I think people, people think that let's, let's skip the primary and we'll vote in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4652.571s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In November, there'll be no race.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4654.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It'll just be the, there'll be the candidate that came out of the primary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4680.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's why I think that this is something that educating our voters and getting something out part of that 3-1-1 is making them understand that there is no Republican<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4693.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: party running in this race.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4695.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So in essence, the winner that comes out of the Democratic primary will be our representative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4700.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have to, it is very confusing as you just saw.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4704.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it would be imperative that maybe we, as a form of a motion, we ask the election department and the mayor and the city administration<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4716.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: share a robocall throughout that district, those districts that are affected, that they understand that November is really just ceremonial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4726.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not the actual election for that race is the third of September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4732.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4761.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Mr. President, this is what's terrible about not having a city solicitor, because I think this is a message that truly needs to be detailed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4770.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think, well, it's for all three candidates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4773.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not political.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4774.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's to make sure that everybody knows for all three candidates that you have a constituent that's going to vote for one of the three candidates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4782.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they assume that they're in the assumption that we'll just vote in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4786.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the truth of the matter is not understanding the processes we just saw.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4791.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that letting them know that September is truly the election for this seat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4796.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't think it's, I'm not saying one party or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4799.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm saying for all three parties that are running for that seat should be given the respect and the effort by this body to ask if we can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4809.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, again, like I said, if we had a city solicitor, be very simple and say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4813.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: let's make weapons city solicitor let's let's do that let's send it off as a b paper and we'll we'll get to that when we can but having it stop right now i think it's it's it's not it's not right it's not right all right uh that's fine i'm just what's the text of the b paper<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4830.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We would like the elections department in the mayor's office to work with a robocall and other messaging, whatever other messaging possible to reach that district that is voting in the, once again, I'm sorry, District 30.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4843.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The 35th Middlesex.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4846.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the state representative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4847.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have three candidates to educate those voters on the importance of that race being the final representation of that position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4864.16s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Does that make sense, Mr. Clerk?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4867.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that you're very good at fixing my mistakes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4912.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the September 3rd race, the September primary being the, right, yes, good, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5088.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5089.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Mr. President, another point with that, if I'm right, if I'm correct or wrong, I know that if there isn't a Republican candidate that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5098.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I, a registered Republican can't, what is it, they report to the elections office to ask to, is it unenrolled so they can vote in that election?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5129.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You say, well, I want to vote as a Democrat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5132.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's important that people that don't have a candidate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5136.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in this district that are registered Republicans can come to the elections office and ask to be unenrolled so they can vote as a Democrat?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5150.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a technical question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5151.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, so that's something if we can ask you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5208.486s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, that's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5504.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5506.651s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I appreciate Council President bringing his resolution forward, but in the past week and a half, we've been getting multiple phone calls from the residents in the Fulton Heights area, which is odd for road infestation, considering we live in a ledge, and you don't have, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5528.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, too many business districts in that area that promote rodents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5533.261s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we're seeing that over the last few years, we've tried, we've talked, I know the director of the health department has made efforts to try to stymie the rodent infestation issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5547.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've even moved to put in ordinances that allow<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5554.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: allow us to go on to private property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5556.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we see nesting and try to do, we have to do more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5561.417s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I've had a few phone calls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5563.579s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the curbside composting is a great initiative, but you're seeing the fear that even though they can't open the lid, they're eating through the bottom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5574.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5576.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there are questions that I think as we move forward that we need to now get more in depth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5582.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You see neighbor communities put together subcommittees and special task force that work directly with professionals from local colleges and local pest control companies and try to find different avenues to stop or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5603.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or slow this process down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5604.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that my motion would be, Mr. President, is that we would convene a meeting with the health department, the mayor's office, the inspectional services, and the DPW to try to craft a task force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5621.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know Boston's calling it the rodent czar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5625.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that Metro has to do something more to figure out the process in stopping this huge health scare that's growing across the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5639.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that what we're seeing is the different<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5648.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: different forms of control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5651.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that some of them at one time worked to feed the catch basins to make sure that the rodents couldn't reproduce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5660.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It wasn't the fact that they were horribly destroying rats all over the community, but they were making sure that they were stopping so they couldn't reproduce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5669.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's gotta be something more being done other than calling the health department,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5675.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: which, by the way, we don't have enough staff to service the needs that we have right now, to then call the exterminator, come out to put bait boxes down and leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5686.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5687.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my recommendation is that we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5690.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5690.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the work that we've done, the Council President's done with a few members of the community with Tufts Medical in that area, but it's just not that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5701.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's time that now that we have Tufts involved in this area, well, let's come together, let's pull everybody together, and let's find a solution for the whole community and how we can attack this problem, because it's only gonna get worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5713.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7672.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7675.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you'll allow me, over the past few years, I've heard many people talk about the legal claims or settlements or court judgments that have been paid by the city or school department for claims made against the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7688.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the school department or employees of the city or the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7692.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yet many of these claims and settlements that have been mentioned have never come before this council, either for an appropriation of money for payment or just to inform us about the claims.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7706.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Going back to a time even before I was on the council, I know that the council had to approve the expenditures of any amount that was over $2,500.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7714.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The purpose of this resolution is for the council to be made aware of the expenditures to settle or pay for various claims made against the city, the school, or any of our employees of the city or our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7731.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My motivation to bring this resolution forward is based on a very simple principle that I'm sure my colleagues can agree with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7737.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That is, expenditures of the city revenue is always a matter of accountability, transparency, and good government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7745.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People deserve to know where municipal dollars are being spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7748.507s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With this in mind, I ask for the support of my colleagues on this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7753.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, as we said tonight, I know that we mentioned just tonight, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7757.171s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We said we need more funding, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7760.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need more funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7762.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we've seen over the last couple of months, we've seen a blatant financial mismanagement of our city's finances, as witnessed with the $9 million of free cash that was recently certified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7777.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The lack of new growth in our community over the past four years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7781.584s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Payments to outside councils that we still have yet to find what the true numbers are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7786.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And lastly, the settlements that mostly are unfunded by the city leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7792.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is very important because it's another aspect that week after week we're coming forward and that we're seeing mismanagement of our city funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7804.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, I get it, there are things that we can't talk about legally, and there are things that might go in an executive session to protect certain laws, and I get that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7815.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But there is a lot of money, from what I've heard, from different department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7820.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like we mentioned the other day, that you just go and speak to the department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7825.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, the department heads aren't gonna tell you the truth, because they work for the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7829.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So like I've said in the past, I've talked to rank and file members that have really shared with me some insight, and it's horrifying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7840.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's frightening where we're looking at maybe five or $10,000 hit here or there with a legal issue, and we never hear anything about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7852.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, I'm glad we have a representative here tonight because I have some questions that I was gonna leave as a resolution, but maybe you can help with, Mr. Salt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7863.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that as a representative of the teamsters and our employees here at the city, you know, even the most simple things, an arbitration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7873.671s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If an arbitration is heard, I'd like to know who pays for those arbitrations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7877.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to know how the attorneys are paid, both sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7881.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: not just the outcome, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7884.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because we still haven't heard the outcome of many things, which we know to avoid the rumor mill, just to get this information from the mayor would be so important, just so we can understand and we could share this with our public and saying, you know, hey,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7903.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In the last couple of months, especially last month, we've seen some pretty disgusting processes in how we've run the finances in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7911.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, we've seen that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7914.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's public knowledge, but this is another aspect that I think needs to be opened so the community can see<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7926.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: why we don't have the funding needed for extra help in the health department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7932.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7934.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7936.999s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8593.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8595.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this, I agree with my councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8599.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a simple request that, again, do transparency, accountability, have the mayor present to us what I've requested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8608.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think it's a simple, it eliminates that outside talk, but then again, it shows<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8613.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if it's something that the community, the taxpayers in this community need to identify that this could be an issue, then it's their right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8621.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I welcome your support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8624.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, I know Councilor Bears said whatever we budget is appropriate and whatever that is, but when you look at the numbers, just as Mr. Seltz just presented, there's some numbers in there that I don't remember going in that room and approving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8637.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, again, this is why we asked, I put this motion forward to ask the mayor for detailed answers in, you know, redacting names or whatnot, but actually showing us that these are real stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8652.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are real lawsuits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8655.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what's already been settled are real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8657.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those, a lot of those aren't private anymore, they're public record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8661.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would ask the mayor to present to us that fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8665.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I say mismanagement, when you hear these stories and whether they're fact or not, let's see if they're fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8671.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If they're fact, then we could discuss something else that's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8676.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what we're paying for our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8681.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: our insurance, our premiums for our settlements, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8686.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What does that increase?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8686.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What have we paid?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8687.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, when we say mismanaging $9 million, it's a matter of opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8691.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My opinion and the people that I've spoke with, when you are in crisis, fiscal crisis, and you're calling with a financial task force to come out to call for an override, but then just a week later ask,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8707.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: expressed that we just we just certified $9 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8710.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's $9 million of taxpayers money that wasn't used properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8716.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So in definition to myself, whether you want to take it or not, it's fiscal mismanagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8721.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You do not manage<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8723.579s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that money responsibly, and that's the taxpayers' money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8727.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, yeah, there are a lot of things that have come up in the last couple of weeks that we need clarity as we move forward with the agenda presented by my colleagues in the mayor to see<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8740.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: where we're going, what direction this community is going, how we got there, and how we don't get there ever again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8745.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a lot of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8746.705s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is just a piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8747.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all I'm asking, is to support the resolution, let the mayor present the information that's needed, and we can move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8754.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9086.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I truly understand what he's saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9087.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'm thinking,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9089.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My take and the comment, the question is that, why wouldn't someone put a foyer in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9094.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If that's the case, they can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9102.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: maybe, but as the governing body, is a governing body that it's my responsibility that if I have a question, why would I have someone else put a FOIA request in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9114.261s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We would ask the city, we would ask the mayor for, as I've done with the resolution, with hopefully with the support of the council, that the mayor gets us the information that I requested just to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9126.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: just to show the answer to the questions under transparency and accountability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9654.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're seeing settlements, but we're not appropriating, we're not voting on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9659.466s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Anything over $2,500, we should be voting on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9663.407s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we're talking about the settlements, we're talking about insurance, we talk about attorney fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9668.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are the things that I want to show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9670.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't say monopoly money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9671.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'm saying is real money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9672.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't say you did, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9673.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, no, I'm saying it's real money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9675.532s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's taxpayers' money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9676.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's why this resolution's come about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9678.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whether Council Beals was strayed off of what the bigger picture is, maybe I should have stayed focused on this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9686.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I really think common sense, eyes wide open, we can see that there's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9693.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's, and again, I'm not saying fraudulent, I'm not saying illegal, I'm saying mismanagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9698.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're seeing the way the city is spending our money, it's fraudulent, it's non-transparent, and there's no accountability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9713.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9760.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Glad you can see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9763.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a huge gaps in what's going on in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9765.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we could just see what spreadsheet, you know, the ones that our chief of staff council president mentioned, let's let's talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9775.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because we talked about KP law, and they came here during the budget season, and openly said we only spend $50,000 on KP law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9780.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9782.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But using that example, when I counted up those months, it came up almost $500,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9787.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's not totally what was in other departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9792.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there are questions that this isn't a conspiracy theory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9797.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are questions that I brought up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9799.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are concrete issues that we have that we want answers from the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9804.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've asked for an audit to do this for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9806.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've asked for transparency and accountability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9809.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the form that we're asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9812.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: move to the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9814.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's get the answers from the mayor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9816.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hopefully she does what she's supposed to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9818.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And like Councilor Leming said, that's a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9821.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If she doesn't do it, I hope someone in the audience files a form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9825.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=11595.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=11599.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just wanted to thank Mr. Bader, this morning I talked to, we had some questions that residents had and the reason why<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=11606.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In the past, I voted no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=11608.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that the questions that were asked by those residents and were clear in those answers, and I shared those answers to those residents that reached out, and I'm in full support with the process as we speak, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=51.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=53.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=53.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=55.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=55.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=56.351s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=57.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=62.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=63.177s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=64.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=70.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: President Ferris.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=110.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=111.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a sad day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=115.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when we heard the passing of probably one of the finest teachers to ever grace the hallways in the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=125.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Robin Irving was a very special person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=129.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She made it her life's mission to take care of our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=133.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's over 40 years of service, and Robin fought the fight against cancer and lost her battle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=145.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's ironic that today's her 70th birthday, and I know that the family has put together a GoFundMe page to make sure her name carries on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=155.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in her name to scholarships for deserving children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=157.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I wanted to mention that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=160.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She was an amazing person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=162.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had many friends that had Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=165.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Irving, and when they talked about Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=168.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Irving, as if they had a mother out of their home, someone that took care of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=173.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then when I was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=177.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: awarded the position to be a McGlynn Elementary Phys Ed teacher, I was honored to work on the other side of the door of Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=185.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Irving's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=186.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if you ever went by Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=187.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Irving's room, you know that she was a teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=194.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She had everything she needed for every kid with every single lesson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=200.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And she was tough, there was times she was tough, but everybody respected her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=205.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when we heard the sad news, I'm not less of a man to say, but I cried in my truck because she was one of the good ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=215.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And just wanted to reach out to her family, especially her nieces and nephews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=222.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know how much she loved them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=226.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And send our deepest condolences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=228.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a person that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=231.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you wanna name a library after, or you wanna name, leave someone's name to show their legacy, Robin Irving's the teacher that deserves that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=244.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So goodbye, my friend, happy birthday, my friend, and thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=252.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=658.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: President Bears?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=732.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=734.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The point of my resolution is very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=738.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This Councilman and I use the words transparency and accountability very often, and I do too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=743.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These words count.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=747.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: at the count only if we not only talk the talk, but we walk the walk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=752.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As this City Council is well aware, I submitted a letter to the Attorney General and the State Auditor's Office expressing my concerns over the way the City Council has used Rule 21 in Mass General Law, C-43, Section 22, unfairly and in a self-serving way to eliminate the discussion of resolutions that call for the expenditure of millions upon millions of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=780.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When papers from the mayor were before the city council on June 7th, the council suspended the rules and approved the motion that the council rule 21 not be allowed to be invoked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=792.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then on June 25th, my request to invoke Mass General Law C-43, section 22, which allows any one council to postpone consideration of a paper for one week was ruled out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=807.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At both of those meetings, my hope was that we could have an appropriate amount of time to discuss these significant issues and also receive input from our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=818.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When the council leadership ruled my request out of order, I had no choice but to bring this to the attention of the proper state offices to receive their input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=829.739s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The state auditor's office responded to me quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=833.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and reviewed my requests and explained first the requirements of the majority of the city council and the agreement of the mayor to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=841.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So here's the simple part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=844.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If this council feels confident that its actions of those two meetings were correct, then your confidence in your actions can be reflected in your yes vote to allow this review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=858.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That would be true transparency and accountability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=861.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If however, you're not confident that the council's action were correct, you should still vote yes for this review because then we will have guidance from the state as opposed to an opinion bought and paid for by attorneys hired by the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=877.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That would be true transparency and accountability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=880.93s">[Scarpelli]</a>: However, if you vote no on this resolution, it will show the residents of our city that this council uses the words transparency and accountability as a punchline that is empty and deceptive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=896.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now is the time to stand up for what you say you believe in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=902.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: let everyone know the only thing greater than your hollow words is your cowardice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=907.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will tell you, I will ask as a form of a motion that we vote to send this to be reviewed by the auditor, state auditor's office to look at our finances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=920.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, again, I'll say it publicly again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=922.868s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have not one time mentioned<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=926.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that there is someone doing something illegal with the city's funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=929.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My questions have been and stymied for one factor, one factor only, financial mismanagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=939.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I move that question, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1213.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1639.105s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let me make it very clear then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1643.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In both the letter and in the resolution, I asked for examination on everything possible, period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1650.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, I want the examination of our city finances, and I'll be meeting tomorrow with the Attorney General's office and talking about the legalities of the processes we have here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1664.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, it's funny, Mr. President, that my fellow Councilors mentioned some pretty outrageous comments, like as this was something that wouldn't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1677.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1679.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The last four meetings,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1684.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe you don't have YouTube, but Councilor Lennon made sure everybody knows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1688.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our meetings are on YouTube now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1690.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Watch those meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1692.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's funny, Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1694.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You tell me about working together and council rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1699.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's funny that you talk about disagreements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1703.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Of course we've had disagreements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1705.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And of course we sat across an issue and one lost and one won.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1709.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Of course they did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1710.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But never, ever, ever has a sitting council been silenced the way this council has silenced me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1725.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: no different than Councilor Callahan speaking about, it seems to fit the narrative whenever it suits your mission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1735.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I remember when we had an issue concerning a legality dealing with a newsletter, and I said something very simple in regards also to the letter that was sent out to the state regarding the transfer tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1751.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1753.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I made a motion that we ask for an opinion from our legal team here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1757.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe you voted no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1759.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe all of you voted no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1762.544s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that stymied the talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1764.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That stymied the process that you yourself just said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1770.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you sit back and you start talking and you're spewing to the public that this is divisive, that this isn't true, oh, these are all true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1780.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These aren't made up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1783.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You suspended the rules so rule 21 could not be invoked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1790.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We were talking about millions and millions of dollars that this council got on a Friday and voted on a Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1799.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that what you talk about transparency and accountability?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1802.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1803.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And instead of walking it through with this open, deliberate conversation, as you just well stated, we did it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1811.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We shut it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1813.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We disrespected this councilor and my ability to work for not the 7,000 people,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1822.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not for the 7,000 people that elected you when you knocked on their doors, but when I put my hand up and I swore to uphold the rules and regulations and laws of this city, I represent all 60,000 members of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1843.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to sit back and spew this disingenuine dialogue that these are lies, that what I'm saying is mistruths, these are situations risen on the fact that you, as the leadership team of this council, you stymied the process of open discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1863.272s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1865.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You forced me to go out and ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1868.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In regards to my fellow Councilor reaching out to the art of his office, great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1874.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I forwarded our city clerk the email that was sent, so I could share that with everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1881.236s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When did you forward that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1882.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, just now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1882.716s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just got it, so I just forwarded it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1884.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good morning, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1886.719s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for your correspondence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1888.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In order for our office to examine these issues, we would need the request for the city of Medford itself, and then it broke down, which Councilor Callahan so eloquently said, it's the vote of the council,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1901.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then it's the vote of the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1903.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And yes, the city would have to pay for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1906.92s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And oh, by the way, yes, the city does do an audit every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1914.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The questions that I would have brought up that evening and the previous meetings before that, that I was silenced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1920.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We looked at situations where we had millions of dollars in other avenues that we can make our school system whole to protect our students, our teachers, and our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1930.351s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I was stunned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1932.331s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then the following week, we got the email, right, that we just found another $9 million, $9 million in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1943.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $34 million in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1945.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there's an opportunity to openly discuss, transparently, with accountability, discuss this process and say, where did it come from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1955.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How did this happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1958.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why can't we use this to support the education process now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1962.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because what has happened, maybe you stick with your 7,000 people you knock on their doors, but you've woken up this community to the fact that whether you believed in an override or you didn't, people are questioning this community's process of fiscal mismanagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1981.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1990.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to call this, sorry, not Council President, to call these allegations, I think it's just disingenuine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1997.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These aren't allegations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1999.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What you're saying in actuality, what I put out there, what I've tried to say for the last four meetings were lies and I made them up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2009.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's simply not true, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2011.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm ashamed that you even brought that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2013.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You could go to every single meeting and watch it yourself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2017.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And all I had were questions that my constituents, our constituents in the city of Medford, were asking me for answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2027.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And all it could have been, even that evening, when we questioned yours and Council President Bezos' signatures with your titles on that letter that supported a transfer tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2039.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All that could have been done was a simple yes vote, voted to legal, them telling me this is what it is, Councilor Scarpelli, and we moved forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2048.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I have an answer for multiple constituents that called me about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2053.574s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No different than this situation or what we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2058.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You made it a mockery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2060.247s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The night of the budget was a mockery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2062.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You want to talk about a disgrace in a Zoom, in a show?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2065.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was a show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2067.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mail with the snide comments and the linking back and forth, disgusting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2072.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Disgusting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2073.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Look at the video.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2074.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You guys look perplexed like this never happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2077.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Go back to YouTube and watch it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2080.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Go ahead and watch it because it's disgusting and it's appalling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2083.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to sit back and call this, these allegations,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2088.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I protested that vehemently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2091.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are truths.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2093.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you forced me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2102.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I made the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2104.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We sent the letter to the attorney general and the auditor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2108.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The attorney general hasn't gotten back to me yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2109.842s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll meet him tomorrow, we hope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2113.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The auditor's office responded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2117.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The response that I got that I shared explained the hows and the what to dos with this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2127.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why this motion has come up that we vote on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2132.705s">[Scarpelli]</a>: passing this over to the mayor, having the mayor make a decision, sending it to the auditor's office, and then having them come in to look and see, not what the audit that we're seeing done when everything is prepared, but at the end of the year, when we find $9 million of mismanagement funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2152.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's unheard of, because as most people in this administration love to do, they contact neighborhood communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2159.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They love to put these charts up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2161.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I did that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2163.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The average increase in free cash in neighboring communities are no more than $4 to $5 million, and that's excessive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2171.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're looking at $34 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2176.005s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you people stifled me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2178.487s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You shut me down that we couldn't talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2182.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those aren't allegations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2184.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those are truths.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2185.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know hate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2186.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know they hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2188.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know when this comes out, I know that it hurts me, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2193.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It hurts me because I was voted just like all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2197.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I was voted, but when I took the seat, I made sure whether a person agreed with me or not, that I made a decision what I think was best for the whole community, all 60,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2210.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But from what we hear from my fellow councilors, that's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2213.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will tell you this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2215.64s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This will move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2217.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll go to a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2218.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think I'm very clear on the vote now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2220.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's examination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2221.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the motion to have the auditor, this council, to vote to allow the state to come in and put through an audit through the state to see where we are and what's been happening with our funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2235.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2236.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, moving forward with the Attorney General's office, we'll see what they say about the management and the style that this Council President used over the last few weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2250.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That has been an absolute atrocious display of leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2254.364s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that'll come out in the next meeting, and I'll make sure I'm a little clearer for everybody when the Attorney General answers those questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2262.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2263.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2281.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You got the letter the morning I sent it through the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2284.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you saw that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2285.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you saw that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2286.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the response from the, the response from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2292.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The auditor, I had it this week, and I forwarded tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2297.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You forwarded at what time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2299.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, just now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2300.233s">[Scarpelli]</a>: During the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2301.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, just now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2301.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2304.076s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, so that's what you're going to win on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2305.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If that's how you're going to play the gutter ball, you've got me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2308.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm just asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2308.839s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've got me, bud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2309.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2310.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You got me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2354.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Don't use my name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2355.681s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of personal privilege.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2357.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the law between the doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2358.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of personal privilege.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2360.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You use my name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2362.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You use my name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2363.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will answer it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2364.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You said that evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2366.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a point of personal privilege.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2368.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You obviously don't know who you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2370.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2371.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2372.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please recognize the law that indicates that I'm the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2375.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2447.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When not, I'm going to Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2837.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Sen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2838.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3484.907s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3486.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just to address a couple of the comments that people use my name directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3490.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: On that first meeting, when we started the discussion talking about possibly using the free cash and being stymied, and then stopping that conversation because we all knew the process the following week would be the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3509.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The next meeting would be to talk about the budget and possibly vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3515.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we attended the next following meeting, which allows me to then discuss that resolution that I put forth, I took it off the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3527.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I took it off the table to eliminate the nonsense that was already passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3537.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The idea to send a resolution through and explain the resolution, the option of thought process of one Councilor, who by the way,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3546.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: understands that sometimes it's inconvenient for people that come to a vote to 100 people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3553.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when you have the responsibility of thousands of people and making sure that we're doing our due diligence with all of the finances and all the financial questions we have, that I took it off the table because it was too late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3571.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My motion that was presented the week before was to discuss the process so we can sit with the mayor and understand the process and get some answers so we can move it forward one way or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3584.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But that was stymied, that was stopped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3587.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it wasn't that I stopped that meeting because of lack of transparency or didn't want to openly discuss something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3596.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was a moot point, we moved on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3599.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Anything I said there eliminated anything we could do because the mayor was ready to move on her votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3606.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So understand that, that's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3610.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know, let me share some shocking, sometimes the administration doesn't tell us the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3622.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you realize that even though you rushed the vote, even though we realized we got information about finances no more than a few days prior to that, that there were still multiple layoffs and we lost many, many teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3639.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that was a lie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3644.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was not an option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3646.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We could have waited and move this out a week after and got the information that all of our citizens wanted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3652.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: not the 200 people that were here that found babysitters, but everybody, that's our responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3659.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we didn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3662.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You made a choice to service the people that service you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3668.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's blatant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3671.165s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You talk about, Councilor Tseng talks about just picking up the phone, call the departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3679.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't trust the departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3685.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They work for the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3688.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I say I don't trust the departments, I speak with the rank and file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3694.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they privately talk to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3698.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we can't use their names because they're afraid of what goes up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3702.34s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not throwing fuel on a fire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3705.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You asked the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3707.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You brought up the question why I simply didn't go to these department heads and talk to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3712.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3714.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The key words in my resolution are transparency and accountability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3720.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if I want something to be transparent, I'm going to bring it up here in front of all of these people so they all understand the process, not sit in a director's office that they can appease your agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3736.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because that's what we're seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3738.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because you said it yourself,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3740.768s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You said it yourself, that was a very important meeting for the override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3744.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was a very important meeting during the budget to get that approved because there was fear that teachers were gonna be laid off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3753.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Simply not the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3756.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, this is a simple, simple resolution as I said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3765.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is just to send this off to the auditor and get,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3770.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a true indication of what the financial mismanagement that I see and others see, that we get the answers that are needed and required as we move forward, especially when you're talking about what you were asking for in November, when you talk about overrides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3785.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because it's very important that we get the message out so everybody doesn't make a decision out of anger or lack of knowledge or lack of what was done during the budget season, because that's what it lends to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3801.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what it lends to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3803.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Say whatever you want, but that's what it lends to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3807.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is why this community is so divided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3811.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't, this is just one council standing up to make sure that the whole community is listened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3819.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not the 200 people that showed up for meeting and they were gonna be inconvenienced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3823.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because honestly, I know all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3826.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know you're very bright people and we've talked a lot<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3830.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if I talked to you privately and I said, realistically, y'all given information about $9 million on a Friday, without talking to anybody, even okay, we talked to the directors, but then we go to move on a vote on a Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3849.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Truly, that is definitely not enough time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3851.768s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been doing this long enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3853.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not enough time to get the answers that this community deserves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3859.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3862.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what was said tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3865.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure, this is the process of the council, and the process of the council, you went through with the letter of the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3872.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You motioned it, you voted it, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3876.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you, say what you want, Council Vance, we worked together, and the council's working together in the room right now, broke a rule that we can use against transparency and open dialogue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3888.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Never would have done that to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3889.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You might have lost the vote,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3892.142s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You might have lost the vote, but it was understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3894.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And same here, hey, when I sit and I lose a vote, I take it and move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3899.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But to be stymied, that's not acceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4475.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4480.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any further discussion by members of the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4483.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, I just have one comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4484.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4486.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just to expand on what Councilor Callahan mentioned about the process and how everybody was here that night and they were so excited about the override and giving the voice to the people first time voting on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4504.429s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you remember the conversation and if you remember the dialogue that was set forth in my motions,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4511.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: was the fact that we had a financial task force that we didn't see or understand how they got to that situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4522.766s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't see how they showed us why we need an override, what got us to that override, and what are we gonna do in the next steps to make sure that we don't need another override the following year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4534.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are the questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4535.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a transparent process that we were asking for that evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4540.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And of course people came up and voted for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4542.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And of course they want to be told that we should go on to vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4546.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4548.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But you're not listening to the people that are right in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4552.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As many of those people that came up and said, we're for it, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4557.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have the same amount of people that are telling you right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4560.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're not listening to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4562.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But you're not hearing them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4564.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I find it a little disturbing that the process of silencing or discussing or transparency or accountability would have come out in those meetings and discussions<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4576.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when we had the opportunity before the votes came out and understood, okay, the financial task force met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4585.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: no minutes, no understanding how they got to where they did, but we're gonna come out with a $7.5 million override, a $30 million debt exclusion, which by the way, you're gonna be shocked when the firefighters come knocking pretty soon, and the understanding that not just a week later, we find $9 million more in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4611.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That alone, if that doesn't open your eyes and say, well, geez, Councilor Scarpelli, eliminate all the negative banter, eliminate one side or the other, geez, that's exactly what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4622.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And yeah, maybe we should look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4627.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even though, Councilor Tseng said it, you just said it, people came to that podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4631.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Of course they were in favor of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4633.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the problem was the people that had questions weren't listened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4638.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a lack of transparency and accountability, my friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4641.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the problem we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4643.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4646.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you might be confused in the verbiage that I'm sending the auditor, but let me simplify it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4651.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm asking the auditor, with our vote,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4657.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to look at our city's finances, period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4662.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll move forward with the Attorney General after I speak with them tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4666.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe they have something to share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4668.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this isn't a very difficult, you can make this a convoluted resolution and be very confusing just because you wanna sign it, but it's a very, to everybody, it's a very simple process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4679.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My resolution states that we ask the state auditor by a city council vote and then the mayor's approval<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4685.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to come in and look at the city's finances because I question the process of millions of dollars in free cash and the process of how we got to certain votes when it comes to a financial task force that didn't have minutes to explain to the public what's happened to this community financially, period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4707.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4707.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4833.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, one more last comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4838.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I bring this point up so we can all understand this, that one of my number one motives of moving to free cash<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4847.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and not leaving it up to a vote, is that during subcommittee, a resident asked a very poignant, moving question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4856.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What happens if the override fails?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4861.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council Bear stated, it'll be absolutely devastating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4865.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There'll be massive layoffs in our education process, not word for word, Council President, but it'll be a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4874.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My process was saying, why gamble right now with a total future and not using the free cash that we had in front of us, and then work together as a community to look at other options, but we didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5340.168s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Donna, are you there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5358.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Eileen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5368.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Eileen, I'm requesting to unmute you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5457.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, um, jessica healy full lock road i'm just wondering why there's really even a Issue with having an outside auditor come in from the state I supported a hundred percent And we did just hear from a lawyer who also agrees so i'm not sure why this Has been such a big deal and all this arguing over just having someone come in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5483.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that use our tax money and pay them to do an audit to be very transparent and put everything to rest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5490.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think everyone would just like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5493.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5904.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council President, if I can, just to clarify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5912.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5914.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5916.51s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we've talked about the audit that's done every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5920.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The process that, the piece that we really would benefit from, from the state audit, isn't just, the audit that we get every year is the figure, the money line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5932.717s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it comes out, like I said, I don't question<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5936.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: whether it's being used fraudulently in the sense that it's illegal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5941.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My questions I have, and something that the state auditor's office will do, is audit the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5947.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not only the figure, but the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5950.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what we're seeing with being the biggest issue right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5953.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the audit comes in and they say, yep, all the numbers add up when you add up the numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5958.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when the year is over, when the year is over and the mayor presents $9 million,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5964.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The process has to be investigated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5966.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6031.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This council might've known, but the financial team, they definitely knew there was $9 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1477.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam Vice Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1480.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1481.304s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm really excited about the direction we're going into because we hear a lot of, you know, why can't Medford move forward and going through the reclassification, I think that the zoning and understanding the changes we haven't had in so long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1494.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think what we're seeing, especially in the last couple of weeks with one of the zoning issues, one of the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1502.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: one of the placements of a very volatile issue we talk about what we've seen is we've seen neighborhoods now get more involved and I'm so happy that one of the biggest things we talked about setting up those teams that are going to go right into the neighborhoods that are really going to talk to those neighbors<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1522.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and get their input to see what we're looking for as a community, what they want in their front door and their backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1528.698s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my only thing is, as we get started, I know that, you know, is how we're gonna get the word out to, you know, when that time comes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1537.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's not for now, but I just wanted to share how excited I am that we're moving through this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1541.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know it's a lot of work with a lot of good people, and I'm really excited about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1545.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as we move forward, I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1548.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The piece that we're seeing now is that community really getting involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1552.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was part of the, I was working in Somerville at the time when Somerville did their rezoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1558.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the mayor at the time really had every department deeply involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1564.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we went from,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1568.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, from square to square and neighborhood to neighborhood, we had everybody represented, every department there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1575.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when the community members had an input, we were taking our fluorescent orange dots and putting it to where they thought was relevant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1582.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that really helped us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1584.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: put together and zone their neighborhoods and be part of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1589.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm very excited about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1591.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just wanna thank you for all your hard work and I'm gonna need bigger glasses for those bigger bullets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1596.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=2975.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just a small question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=2976.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When do you think these maps are going to be available online in PDF format?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=3202.692s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=677.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=680.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Every community should have a Tom Lincoln.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=682.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I admire Tom for his conviction of what he believes in, and Tom was the person that fought for what he believed in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=691.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if anybody wants to know why the Brooks Estates is still standing and why it's still a great piece of our community, it's because of Tom Lincoln.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=701.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I can't wait to see him and shake his hand and thank him because he put a lot of time and effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=708.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are many, many nights that we would butt heads and not agree, but we would always respect each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=717.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I admire what he did for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=720.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And hopefully someone's ready to pick up that torch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=723.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Tom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=947.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's say some nice things So we have known your family a long time and I just want to commend you and thank you and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=967.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know people think today's times might be a little difficult, but I remember some really tough times in Medford, and it's the people that made this building what it was and what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=980.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's people like yourself that I personally am gonna miss, and it's like, I think that it's a piece of history that'll be walking out the door, but at the same time, you left a legacy here that I hope<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1008.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for everything you've done for the city and enjoy retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1327.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1480.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Janice DePace, I've known Janice for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1485.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I remember her children participating in sports, and I remember teaching with Janice while she was at Medford High School, and now she's...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1498.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: on to bigger and better things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1500.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm so excited for her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1501.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's just a great person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1502.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you know Janice DePace, she has a smile on her face and a special word for you just to keep, just to make sure you have a great day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1509.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And she was like that with her students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1511.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that everybody that crossed her path.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1514.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So she'll be missing the clerk's office, but she's earned an amazing retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1839.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To the Babe Ruth and Willie Mays of the teaching profession.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1846.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wanna thank Mrs. Lasky because I had the honor not only to be a parent of a child in her class, but also a colleague.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1855.474s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you were the pinnacle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1859.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You were what everybody wanted to aspire to as colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1863.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you never, you never wavered in your emotions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1872.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You were just a great teacher<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1875.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You were there for every single child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1877.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know the impact you made in my child's life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1880.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, dad's an elected official, but my son could care less about politics until he ran for fourth grade president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1890.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he woke up one morning with a suit on and he says, dad, can you hold this behind me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1895.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said, what is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1896.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He said, it's American flag.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1897.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, what are you going to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1898.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He says, I'm going to give my speech with someone holding the American flag behind me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1902.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, how come you didn't carry it with what dad's doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1906.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He says, you weren't in Miss Lasky's class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1908.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to Justin's point, I remember when he came home one day, he met Mr. Lasky and he says, I know what I want to do for my future, dad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1918.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said, why, what do you want to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1919.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He says, I met Mr. Lasky, and I want to be the reason why we clean Mystic the lake so we can all swim.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1927.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And just those impacts that we made, the growth and respect to our environment, the little lessons that became huge lessons today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1941.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I thank you from the bottom of my heart because it takes a village to raise your children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1944.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we were very fortunate, the Scarpelli household, to have you as one of our children's teachers and teaching them from right and wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1952.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1954.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You earned the retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1956.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know there's a huge void at the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1958.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I remember when we started, that was the A-Team, remember?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1961.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to be in the same breath<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1963.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as you know, I think was by default with my position, but to be in the same breath as when they called the 18 and talk and stand side by side with Don Alaska gave me a sense of pride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1973.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1974.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for all your work and enjoy the retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1978.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2015.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would like, if we can, Mr. President, is bring Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2017.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Lasky back, and we send her off with one of those wonderful citations that you draw up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2024.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2024.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That'd be great if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2025.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2026.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe invite the whole Lasky family, because I know we haven't seen them for a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2031.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2132.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2133.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We recently lost an amazing person from an amazing Medford family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2141.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had Lauren Kane passed away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2143.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those people that didn't know Lauren, Lauren was an unassuming but very powerful figure in our community for the fact when being a police officer, a female police officer, wasn't the norm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2161.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: she took that job with such pride and such vigor that she started as a young person, as a teacher, and then moved on to be a police officer, and then moved on to hold<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2173.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to hold huge positions with the drug enforcement team and making sure that she played a huge impact in making sure that drugs weren't being distributed to our youth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2189.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And she worked for the DEA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2191.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She worked for the city of Cambridge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2193.221s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And most of all, she worked here for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2196.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, it's a sad day for, uh, the method police department that they lost one of their own and, uh, she will definitely be missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2205.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would ask that we send our condolences to the cane family for, um, for a person who really gave her life for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2214.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, um, we may she rest in peace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2217.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2556.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2837.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2838.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So first I want to commend the neighbors and the residents that really pulled together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2845.509s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what you see in front of you is what happens when you see that something might affect our neighborhood in a negative way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2855.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I found amazing is I went to an organization, a group of neighbors put together a meeting at the Fireman's Club, and I think probably about 130 people showed up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2866.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we heard from everybody there with respect and honor to every individual involved was that nobody was against the process of helping people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2879.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what everybody was looking for is making sure that this facility or a facility like this would be put in a location where it didn't affect residential neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2894.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's amazing to see the community rally around this and really start a grassroots quick organization to really rally around and just educate people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2906.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's what's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2908.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we have, what I realized in those conversations, there were some people very angry at George Scapelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2915.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and deservedly so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2918.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is something that we talked about with our leadership team here that when we did the recodification of our zoning and we implemented these type of facilities in the medical field, in the zoning process, that it was then going to go to a special permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2937.714s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We realized the impact it could have now legally<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2942.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with the facility like a methadone, and people keep saying clinic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2947.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what really brought a lot of people to their feet was it's not a clinic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2950.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There weren't people there to assist people that were addicted, but it was just a distribution site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2958.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2959.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had people that were involved that were both former recovering addicts, and we talked to administrators in the field, and they really shared an input that really educated a lot of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2974.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, at the end of the discussion, it wasn't that, let's keep these people out of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2980.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, it was, if it's needed in Medford, let's find a location where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2986.164s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they can get their help and the support, but at the same time not affect a residential area that's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2992.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Feeds away from a dance studio, a school, the lack of parking in that area affecting small businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3001.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there were a lot of little intricacies that played a huge part in what that neighborhood, the effects it would have had in the Salem Street neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3012.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I commend the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3012.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I had some issues because we wanted to make sure that without a city solicitor, I reached out to the mayor this weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3023.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She had an attorney that's well-versed in these topics to call me to make sure that we didn't say something that would get us in trouble later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3033.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that with this motion,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3037.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as this process started moving forward, you saw that everybody was listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3042.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You saw that every department in the city was listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3045.362s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor was listening, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3047.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The Board of Appeals said, one of the biggest questions was, well, how do we make this a hybrid meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3053.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because there are people that couldn't make a Zoom meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3056.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So making it, opening it up to everybody in the community so everybody had an input in this decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3066.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My motion tonight would still be for a moratorium moving forward, but working directly with Mrs. Hunt and the mayor's office and making sure that we look at our zoning to make sure that any<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3084.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any facilities under this criteria are moved into non-residential areas where it won't affect our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3093.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, there's still a process, but that would be my recommendation and my resolution if we can, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3101.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the meetings are hybrid, so everybody can still attend those meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3108.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3109.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I can't thank<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3114.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This sometimes is elected official, you look back and you say, geez, with this process, sometimes being a politician, you get, you know, your colleagues have one way of thinking, you have another way of thinking, and kind of get a little discouraged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3127.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But one thing you do know is that you all love the city of Medford, and we're all fighting for the right reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3134.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what I saw<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3136.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this past week with community members rallying together to make sure everybody was heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3143.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I loved, there was, you know, I'm getting phone calls from young people that have young children in the schools that just moved to Method a few years ago, but in the same breath, they were<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3156.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: introducing me to their 88-year-old neighbor that they were making sure that they felt comfortable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3161.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what's amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3163.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We really took care of our neighbors with this situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3166.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I'm going to say this again because we talked about this issue too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3171.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This wasn't to divide at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3172.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that people are looking at social media and saying, this part of the city is saying, suck it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3177.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This part of the city is saying this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3179.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These people are saying that, you know, shame on you for not wanting to take care of people that need support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3185.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was never the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3187.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With everybody I talked to, it was an open mind, but with the goal of making sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3193.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These types of facilities are located in the community that doesn't affect our residential neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3201.512s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I give them all the respect and pats on the back that they deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3209.636s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate this company that realized that maybe this isn't the way to go and didn't want to continue with the fight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3223.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For now, Salem Street is in a better place right now because there were a lot of issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3230.855s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it wasn't just what people would think that with the methadone distribution site coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3237.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People were concerned about the parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3239.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People were concerned about the small businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3243.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And people were concerned about that whole corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3245.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that it was really expressed in a mature, responsible,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3253.304s">[Scarpelli]</a>: diplomatic and not divisional conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3258.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3259.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I will tell you, I am so impressed with, and as I move forward, I'll put a motion through Mr. President later on, that we convene a community engagement committee that brings in the talent we have in our community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3279.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, there are some amazing people that are in the field of addiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3286.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are amazing people that are engineers, and there's amazing people that work with traffic studies, and there are doctors, and there are legal minds that really came out and shared their expertise for the greater good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3302.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not to be negative, not to go one way or the other, but really to share an opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3308.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I commend everybody here for being here and following through with something that they knew that was going to impact their neighborhood and this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3316.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm glad to see that a wrong is righted and we'll be working hopefully after we pass this resolution that we work with the mayor's office and the community development team and really try to change that zoning so we're not in this position again that we're making sure that if it's needed then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3337.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we'll have a location where it's not gonna impact the community like it has in last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3341.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3343.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3951.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to clear clarity with the Council, if I can, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3957.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we have the Council, we have a representative that the city had hired to work directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3965.575s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want to make sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3967.717s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I, what I put in as a motion is legally, um, you know, acceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3973.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to put something in that's going to negatively affect that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4129.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, if we could just move forward and send this to the subcommittee in zoning and we stop the process as soon as we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4148.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I think we eliminate the moratorium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4150.663s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've taken that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4151.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we restructure the motion to ask to refer this to the zoning, our subcommittee in zoning to draw up the legal and proper terminology to move this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4165.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4222.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry, can you give us some guidance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4223.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we have residents that have worked very hard on this issue that want to be heard tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4228.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If there's a possibility that they can express their input and their time and effort they put into this, I would recommend or ask that you would allow them to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4251.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so if you want to speak on this, you'll have to wait at the end now to public participation, and you can speak on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4589.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we're in a good place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4592.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think this is productive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4593.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're in a recess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4594.364s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8238.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=10550.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just wanted to make that a point that was mentioned, questioned by a few residents via phone calls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=10561.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=10571.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I make the motion that we approve the special permit and with the 30, 60, 90 day review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11184.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11186.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, and I appreciate all your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11188.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that when we are committed to support the CPA, I think that there's some clarity maybe you can help with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11194.424s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that when we first voted for this, it was a matching number by the state, correct, at the time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11202.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It still is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11203.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have we seen that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11204.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we getting that money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11205.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We receive it every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11207.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Every year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11207.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And how much is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11242.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's 14% this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11249.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12813.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12813.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scrivner?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12816.621s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for all your work, Tom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12817.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12818.368s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the questions that residents called me and they're just concerned that yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12823.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, and I appreciate the developers and having that control, but the conversations I had with a few neighbors that here are a few homes that aren't in the historical realm, and they would need approval to change the color of their house or a window frame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12842.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what they've told me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12843.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So maybe we can dispel those rumors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12883.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so that's, with developers, listen, I support this and I understand what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12889.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that what I'm hearing is just the neighbors that are saying, what's recommended for materials if they had to make a change in their home and they're living on a fixed income.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12902.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and how that could relate to their processes if they needed something to be remodeled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12907.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's the biggest concern and where it falls in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12911.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that really hasn't been delineated for, okay, this home was built in 1974 and they want to replace some windows and the windows might not fit in the criteria that we might be looking at with the commission, but it's affordable for the family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12931.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: sure so i think that that's my biggest concern with this i don't think that i've heard that it we've been saying that it's been recommended but if they say no what are the ramifications um well i was gonna put this on the slide but but but um we've actually never said no okay<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12957.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But how long are you going to be there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12962.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12977.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12978.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I like I said, I think that what you're doing and what we're doing that in that neighborhood for years, I mean, and I know that, you know, for my friend sharing music, who is a strong proponent and former former school commember with myself and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12993.459s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, I know the passion she had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12994.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's not like I said, it's not, this isn't something that I would talk against because of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12999.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that the biggest piece is that everyone has the neighbors that are concerned that many people have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13044.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate you and I appreciate who's here right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13047.424s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My fear is if we're putting the disordinates in, it's the next group that comes in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13051.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If they come in and they have a hard line and they're like, no, we're not gonna do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13054.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, you get to control who.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13058.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, no, we don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14808.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14810.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Last week, I know we had a very informative meeting on the budget a few weeks ago when we talked about the processes and where this money is coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14820.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we voted for an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14826.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and an override that put forth the onus on the children in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14835.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I put forth a recommendation to look at free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14840.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We then noticed that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14845.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We were informed that in this packet that we've now have $9 million added to that free cash to roughly $34 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14853.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm curious, when you went through this process, did the financial task force identify, did they know about that $9 million as it's going forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14877.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so I know that my fellow councils, we have five money papers in front of us, and they, I believe, what was it you implemented?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14891.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the rules to avoid Rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14896.794s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will do this with all the papers tonight, but as my right, I'm invoking state law under Chapter 43, Section 22, which reads, Section 22, any ordinance or order or resolution may be passed through all stages of legislation at one session, provided that no member of the Council objects thereto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14917.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If any member of the council objects, the measure shall be postponed for that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14921.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm going to vote that right for the fact that we're pushing things through and we're not getting the information, at least this council is not getting the information they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14930.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's a tactic that's very silly that we're going to try to get information that was passed, that was information that was given to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14939.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I made sure that we reached out to the state legal department and they said, any budget paper,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14946.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If this is invoked, our ordinance is invoked, then I can supersede that with the state ordinance until I, as one city council,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14955.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: who finds this process so faulty, and so smelling with the lack of transparency, that we're so confused of where this money is coming from,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14970.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and I've used this many, many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14973.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're all very bright people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14975.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not saying anybody's doing anything illegal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14979.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm telling you this is financial mismanagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14981.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We asked for a $7.5 million override on the fare of our families and children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14987.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wanted to propose a $5 million free cash proposal that eliminate that fare, then the community can look to see whether we need an override or not, which I wouldn't oppose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14998.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But instead, we required it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15001.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was stifled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15003.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we moved to the next meeting, which was the budget meeting, and we had similar questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15009.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now we move to the next meeting, we come up with $9 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15014.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have $34 million in free cash, with an override still hanging out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15021.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we still nervous about the kids in the schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15023.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I have the right to invoke this rule, and I do so, and I will do with all money papers tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15029.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15045.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been instructed by legal industry that this is a money paper that I can implement at my disposal, in my discretion, and I do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15055.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I question the chair, if you wanna stretch this out even longer,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15067.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I am opposing rule 22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15085.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, I have it in front of me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15086.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15087.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15089.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You want to play the game, so I'm playing the game with you guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15092.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know, I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15093.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because it's kind of funny that when you want to talk about information, I've implemented my right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15157.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if you want, I've questioned the chair, I've put in the rule moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15183.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not debatable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15184.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The rule is not debatable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15186.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It doesn't apply.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15187.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, remember.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15190.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you pulled this last week, I did my due diligence to make sure that the information is getting out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15195.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's funny, we can have five meetings in subcommittee about a newsletter, but you wanna take these motions on money papers and force it down people's throat without giving it its due diligence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15207.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Shame on all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15306.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll text you, Ken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15307.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15308.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But that's a disgrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15313.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have any of you talked to the administration for $9 million?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15320.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The 20, the July.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15325.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You agree to call on Bob anytime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18136.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NkdSQu8o7Y4&t=91.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nobody was against the process of helping people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NkdSQu8o7Y4&t=96.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what everybody was looking for was making sure that this facility or a facility like this would be put in a location where it didn't affect residential inhabitants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=45.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=99.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=100.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was informed of this wonderful news that we have two amazing Method residents that are sharing their 70th wedding anniversary, and I wanted just to express our deepest happiness for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=117.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know that they have three very proud children, Josie, Janet, and Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=123.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They wanted to make sure that their parents were recognized and just an amazing accomplishment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=129.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And 70 years cheesy, that is something to really to applaud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=136.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just wanted to share that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=137.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=159.02s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=299.963s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=383.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=385.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=473.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1434.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1436.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1910.93s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you, Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1913.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is, again, a very popular location and it looks like everything is in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1920.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will move approval after we hear from any questions from my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2064.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I question the chair on the ruling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2068.768s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I vote no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4573.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4574.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I will share the probably the only comment that I agree with the mayor is that an override should go to the community, but if it's done right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4589.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Last meeting, I posed a question about using free cash and showing the process so everybody could see what it does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4600.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And just for the fact that the possibility, now maybe the mayor can answer this, in November, Madam Mayor, if the override happens to fail, what happens to our school department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4630.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You usually are, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4657.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4659.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we would take that gamble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4661.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's what we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4663.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll revert back to June 20th of last year during the budget meeting, when I'm sure you remember the meeting that you had with both Councilor Bears and President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4675.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as Councilor Bears stated before, it's in the minutes, it's in the video that Councilor Bears met with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4684.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: behind closed doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4686.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you came to an agreement and he's going to vote for the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4691.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we did was you sold your soul because what you did is I felt like Nostradamus because as I said that night, what you're doing is going to put our city and financial ruins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4705.076s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4706.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4707.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the fact that when we look at where we are today,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4710.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and what we talked about back a year ago, we've had one year knowing that this was gonna happen and what was created to make this less harsh for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4724.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4727.582s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You started a financial task force of you, the chief of staff, Council President Bears, Councilor Collins,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4738.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe vice chair Graham and the chief of staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4743.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That is our financial team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4748.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I talked to neighbor communities as they lunged into these proposition two and a half, I talked to Mayor Curtatone, who informed me back in 2009 when they faced the same situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4762.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is what neighbor communities do for, I believe the word's been thrown out there, transparent, which I think is an absolute farce being used that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4772.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What they did back in 2009 to that community, they set up a financial advisory committee provided with expert advice from both savings and revenue production measures designed to help the city maintain its financial strength and face this deepening economics recession.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4789.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They looked at a committee which had Samuel Tyler, president of the Boston Municipal Research Bureau of Free Assistance, Jonathan Sloan, the president and co-CEO of Century Bank, Jeffrey Hartigan, senior vice president investments of UBS Financial Services, the Chamber of Commerce and leadership team from their financial team, and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4818.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Daniel Richards, Professor Daniel Richards at Tufts University and in the economics department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4825.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what I've been saying, that we might need an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4830.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We might need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4832.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But why divide the community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4833.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why gamble our future, our kids' future, by not doing it properly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4838.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what do we do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4840.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We met behind closed doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4841.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You sat in the meeting since I believe Councilor Bears said September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4846.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've had meetings that we've had no updates, no minutes, no notes, nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4850.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Bears stated that when we get closer, he will give us all the information possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4859.065s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we've got, we got a message from yourself that we are now going to just jump into an override, jump into debt exclusions, and jump into very, very scary times for a lot of very vulnerable residents in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4875.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Of course, when I asked for debt exclusion, I worked with the best financial mind in Aleesha Nunley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4881.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You remember her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4882.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Aleesha Nunley, who was an award-winning budget creator,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4889.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: she was, and when she broke it down for us, we eliminated senior citizens, and we eliminated veterans to see what that exclusion looked like for new fire stations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4901.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the numbers were drastically different, but we were making sure we were taking care of the most vulnerable members of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4908.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I asked for the other day was, when I was unceremoniously ruled 21,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4915.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and made quiet again, because what I was saying made sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4920.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Taking that money, five to $7 million out of free cash, and balancing the budget, and then working together by being more transparent and open in the process of an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4931.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You mentioned that the process, that looking at the process, it's only $440 a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4944.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, that's minimal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4945.272s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure, that sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4948.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what's scaring our residents, maybe you're not listening to them or even hearing them, especially our most vulnerable, when you're looking at a transfer tax that was mentioned, rent control that was mentioned, a registry fee that was mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4962.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about a debt exclusion for a fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4968.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's probably $250 million debt exclusion for a new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4972.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who does that fall on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4975.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our homeowners, and a lot of these homeowners that some of my colleagues think that are rich because they own a home of a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4984.159s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I'll give you an example of a person I talked to today, and when she said, George, I'm gonna be honest, this scares me, because her and her husband bought their home in Medford 60 years ago for minimal money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4998.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now their home's worth a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5001.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that million dollars now, because of the tax rate, now these little add-ons, as you called it, they're just small, as they keep adding on, these most vulnerable members of our community are petrified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5014.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They fear where we're going with this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5018.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I would have asked you, Madam Mayor, is looking at the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5023.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and where we've been in the last five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5026.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What have we done to create new growth?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5028.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What have we truly done to create revenue to support our streets, our sidewalks, our schools, our fire, our police?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5036.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What have we done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5037.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've had 340B projects that you turned your nose to that they've all walked away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5042.868s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Millions of dollars, millions of dollars in revenue through tax and through permits and fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5051.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Millions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5052.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just that alone in three projects that we know of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5056.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we look at this process, this is a total farce when you look at what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5062.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We look at the different processes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5065.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And like I mentioned, here we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5070.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This was mentioned on Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5073.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is probably the biggest, biggest motion, resolution to come in front of this council ever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5082.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Ever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5084.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we have no meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5085.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't talked about this as a council, community, and not once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5090.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we've had five meetings on a newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5096.65s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when you're talking about affecting thousands of people, thousands of homeowners, we haven't had any discussions, except for you and your financial task force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5107.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That doesn't seem like a financial task force at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5110.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because what it reads is what it reads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5112.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if it walks like a duck, it smells like a duck, it's a duck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5115.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You guys went in the back room, and you found the easiest way so you could be let off the hook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5121.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that is by debt exclusion to override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5125.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's a shame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5127.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That is a shame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5129.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I showed you what other communities do, what they've done in the past, and how it works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5135.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked to the superintendent who came up and talked to us about making it whole, and her saying that, no, it's not going to make it whole for what we talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5143.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I believe Vice Chair Graham mentioned to one of the city council, I believe Intoppa,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5151.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When he asked the question, if we get to 79 million, will everything be put whole?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5155.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She said, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5157.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The superintendent sat in front of us and said, absolutely not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5161.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's gonna take more money, just like you will, and put it into a black hole that we don't know where it's going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5169.571s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the proof is in the pudding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5172.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our numbers aren't very good, Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5175.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we look at our education numbers, we don't look good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5179.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not doing well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5180.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we provided more funding to the school department above all other departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5187.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not to say we don't need more, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5190.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it's how it's managed right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5192.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a weak question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5195.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate the dog and pony show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5199.18s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate everybody patting each other on the back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5201.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this was a complete joke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5203.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Lack of transparency, lack of communication with all members of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5209.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I'll say it again, I don't disagree that we might need an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5215.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I say that from the get-go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5217.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what we haven't done is we haven't done this together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5222.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What you've done tonight, if you caused enough divide in our community, Madam Mayor, we are now divided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5228.651s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I will tell you, I've had hundreds of people call me on both ends, 100 people saying, George, we need an override, and having great discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5236.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I've also had hundreds of phone calls from people that are saying, no, this isn't good, and we're gonna fight on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5244.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So instead of sitting there together as a group,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5248.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and putting it together and figure out the best course transparently, what we can do for our community, we didn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5255.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: On June 20th, you sold your soul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5261.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This task force was put together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5266.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You sat here doing nothing, because you knew this was going to be nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5268.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm glad you could smile, miss, because you're really affecting hundreds of people's lives here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5273.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then you come out and come out out of all this work, not knowing what you did, for overrides, debt exclusions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5283.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, I will invoke Rule 21, which states<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5295.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: dispositions of all items appearing on the city council agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5299.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All items of business appearing upon council agenda shall be taken up in the order their parents and fully openly debates the disposal of by vote of council previous to the consideration of any other item of business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5312.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No item of business shall be referred to committee except for the following reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5317.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for the study and the report of subsequent meeting, for the purpose of drafting an ordinance, and the event that open discussions may prove damaging to the character and reputation of a person or persons, all matters referred to the committee shall reappear on the council agenda for the meeting for four weeks following the referral, unless sooner presented by the committee chair or a majority not exceeding two weeks is voted by the council upon request of the committee chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5344.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: majority committee memberships.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5346.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any financial paper appearing on the council agenda for the first time shall be automatically laid on the table for one week when such action is requested by any member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5357.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now you might've suspended the rules, but I want the community to realize you stifled me last time disrespectfully shutting down rule 21 because I made sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5370.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and it was a viable way for us to slow things down and do it the right way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5375.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then tonight, you suspend the motion for this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5379.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well I invoke rule 21 this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5383.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if I have to, I would look into contacting our attorney and looking for an injunction to see where this goes, because I think this is a fraudulent process by the president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5394.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7005.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7008.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate the dialogue back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7013.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just a quick note to the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7015.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The presentation you just gave was the same presentation we heard at the debate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7021.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, no shovel in the ground, no money in our accounts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7026.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done nothing at Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7028.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done nothing in Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7032.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And councilor Tseng, immediate funding is available when you start these projects and permits and fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7039.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But my biggest issue I'm having here is not the fact that, because people are gonna leave tonight saying councilor Scarpelli is against an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7048.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, that's not what I, I've said this a thousand times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7052.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And councilor Callahan said, democracy is so important, getting the vote out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7057.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I agree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7060.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But why behind closed doors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7062.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why weren't we involved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7065.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why would you announce it on a Friday and then bring it to the floor on a Tuesday and then vote?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7073.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Especially when there are viable options that we know of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7077.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Free cash is there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7080.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You can use the five to seven to do everything you said to pull in the hot strings of all the parents and kids and teachers who, by the way, are my friends, my relatives, my family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7090.373s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I understand completely, but there's an option there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7093.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then maybe step back and say, well, instead of dividing this, instead of making this a contentious situation, let's sit together and say, well, did we look at the process of eliminating seniors to this process and how much would it cost us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7108.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did we look at eliminating veterans from the process and see how much would it cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7112.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7115.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Democracy isn't saying that six people in one room say it's all right and that's the way we should do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7122.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's democracy, no that isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7124.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Democracy is being open and honest and being truly transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7130.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about looking at where the funding was and where the funding's gonna go because when I say the black hole, I say we were given millions and millions of dollars from ARPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7143.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what do we do with it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7144.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing to show for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7145.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Infrastructure needs, it was the airport, nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7148.518s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You could get angry all you want, Madam Mayor, and turn your head, but you made some pretty snide comments tonight, and it's pretty embarrassing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7154.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you, I will tell you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7158.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You put on this paper, excuse me, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7163.582s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've talked about, Madam, I believe you said it was that we needed to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7171.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the people that were getting jobs illegally or questionable, and you were cleaning up City Hall, you've used that comment a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7183.316s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I tell you what, I'd like to sit down at these meetings and say, well, look what they've done in other communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7188.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Where did the funding go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7189.842s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why are we here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7190.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And how do we fix it moving forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7193.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What have we used in consultants, Madam Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7195.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What have we used for investigators, Madam Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7198.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What have we spent on for legal fees in the hundreds of thousands?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7204.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What have we used in settlements?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7207.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are millions of dollars that we wasted because you put a cape on and thought that was your job, and that wasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7214.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the courts, obviously now we're hearing it and we're seeing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7218.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will be honest with you, again, it would have been nice to have some time to sit with the community and figure out, or at least all the council, because it seems like six people know what they're doing in the council, but there's one person sitting back saying, well, I had questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7236.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had things to offer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7238.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I came out and started sharing that on the council floor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7244.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was pushed by asking me to put the amendment first, then I was asked to verify comments, and then when it started getting heavy and it started making sense, we sectioned 21-me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7258.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now we get to tonight where I think we do need breathing room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7262.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need another week to look at this, to look at this and ask some questions and make sure people, through the democracy, the process of democracy, that people ask these questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7274.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you can pat yourselves on the back all you want of this task force, and you came to this agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7279.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But to present all the information from this hardworking task force that was presented to the public on a Thursday or Friday, and then brought out for a vote tonight, is a disgrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7292.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's really, this isn't the way democracy works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7296.373s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know if you, deep down inside, I think all of you know it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7301.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, Mr. President,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7305.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that a lot of people do want to speak, and again, I'm just going to leave off with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7310.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had a mechanism in place that could have taken care of our children, our teachers, our parents, all these coaches and teachers that you're looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7319.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: through free cash, which we had millions because of the process that was mismanagement of finances in our community for the last five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7328.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And an abundance of that much money is just bringing it back to who deserves it, and that's the taxpayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7333.93s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Remember, that's the taxpayers' money that weren't spent correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7338.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now we have an option now to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7342.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And instead of doing that, we're gonna rush through a vote tonight, which it's sad to say I will vote no, not for the fact that Councilor Scarpelli doesn't think that we possibly could use an override, but we didn't do it the correct way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7357.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We did it behind closed doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7359.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whether you wanna say it was a great process, whether you wanna say it was transparent, it wasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7366.579s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7419.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still have no city solicitor, Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7460.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whatever puts you to sleep, Madam Mayor, every night, that's a shame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7463.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I sat next to you for four years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7467.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7467.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I respect you, then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7471.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7476.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I just want to remember.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7479.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want the mayor to remember that I remember that person that sat next to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7484.247s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And she wouldn't deal with what's going on right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7486.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So shame on you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7488.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whatever puts you to sleep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7830.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, if I can point a personal privilege.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7834.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7835.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll say this to all due respect, whatever Mr. President makes my colleague feel good, but what he did was stifle the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7844.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was very clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7845.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You asked questions as the chair of the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7849.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I answered your questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7850.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You did not rule it out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7852.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We move forward with the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7854.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when it started getting uncomfortable, my colleague ruled to shut me down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7859.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7860.907s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why I shut it down tonight is because it just doesn't matter because the process is already through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7870.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What you're asking for, and what I was asking for, was never entertained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7875.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It couldn't have been entertained, Mr. Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7880.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if I said what I needed to say tonight, it would have needed time for the administration to look into that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7886.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For instance,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7888.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: looking at an override and taking senior citizens out of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7893.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know Councilor Collins has mentioned over and over again, that's transparent and there were notes and all due respect for the vice president, Mr. President, those not the questions that we had, or I had, or the people that I represent had out of those meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7911.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because what we had was the options of doing A, B, or C.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7915.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But with those options comes processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7918.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For instance, we need an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7922.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, were there any other options?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7924.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, if we did do an override, what would it look like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7929.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what my questions were going to be driven through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7935.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8590.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Mr. President, uh, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8594.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when I asked for debt exclusion, the finance director at the time, Aleesha Nunley did a study that excluded our seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8604.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And my comment tonight would have been through the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8609.766s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It would have been interesting to see before we got to this point, if seniors could have been excluded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8617.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, uh, but I, I believe there's council bears says it's, it's a mass law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8622.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe there is a process that you can work with the state to get that exempt by the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8627.917s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14300.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can you repeat that again, Council President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14301.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14332.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14366.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14372.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14422.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14545.805s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14595.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14747.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15185.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam Vice Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15189.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I also appreciate the resolution because it definitely is something that we should understand and with a little compassion, but to what relates to the proposed site, I think it's also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15212.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: conversations I've had with former addicts and, um, and people that were once on methadone that really stressed to me that, uh, the location is, um, is something that should be looked at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15226.855s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, um, to help the city find a location, um, that would be suitable, but, um, in the area that's being requested where it's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15238.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a few blocks from the school, across the street from the dance studio, a park right down the block.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15245.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there are some concerns there for the residents and the parents of the Roberts school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15254.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that has to come into play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15257.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15259.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, like again, this isn't coming arbitrarily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15262.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is coming from discussions that I've had with, uh, with addicts themselves and who've, who've told me that it should be in a place because, uh, there are some serious concerns there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15275.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, although I appreciate my fellow council bringing this forward and I feel for, uh, and respect, um, a resolution at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15286.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh, in the same breath is understanding that, um, having the location in part of the community that could negatively affect so many, um, we have to look at their well being as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15301.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, I thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16944.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16946.11s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=17.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=74.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=79.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=81.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a long time coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=82.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that it's funny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=85.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know if people know Councilor Caraviello and what kind of a person he is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=92.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Caraviello ran for mayor, unfortunately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=95.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In my view, he was a couple votes behind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=99.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But you would think that someone who's spent so much time<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=103.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in this chamber working for the Citizens of Medford, you'd think he'd be tired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=107.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But last week, I think he spent over 60 hours helping an 88-year-old<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=115.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: young lady that was being displaced from her apartment who was battling cancer, and he drove her all over the city to make sure that she was safe and her rights were protected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=130.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is the type of person Rick Caraviello is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=135.541s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've had the honor of working with Councilor Caraviello as an elected official and as our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=144.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: past patriarch and someone that I mentored myself against, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=149.739s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To receive this award from the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=151.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's perfectly fitting. And I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=157.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: miss you back here, but I know you're still working hard for the citizens of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=162.231s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We should all take a great look and understand how Rick Caraviello lives his life, because if we had more Rick Caraviellos in this world, I think Medford would be just a supreme place to live.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=174.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So congratulations, my friend, well earned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=751.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=752.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I have to put this forward for one simple reason, that the acknowledgment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=759.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that yesterday was a very special day, and I know that some of my fellow Councilors were there and showing their support to our veterans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=767.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, my wife ran another half a marathon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=772.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was there supporting her, but I wanted to make sure that this body recognized all of the sacrifices made for our military men and women, and really showed that respect yesterday, and understand where we are today is because of our veterans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=792.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1403.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: parks, open spaces, historical sites, and affordable housing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1410.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1411.186s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that this falls, just it falls in with the process and it's something that's so needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1416.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that it's been working, the process has been working, I think, in the cemetery and other places around the city to make sure that we take care of our tree canopy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1425.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1445.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1492.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1495.01s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A quick update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1495.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think everybody's waiting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1497.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So how's everything look?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1528.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's great news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1530.353s">[Scarpelli]</a>: really exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1530.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that, uh, Mr. President, I see that I know that we're waiting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1534.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything right now is pending.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1536.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as you said, this is provisional right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1538.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1539.64s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would move forward what we have in place right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1607.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3538.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3538.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I, I too feel, um, that we, we owe a certain amount of protection to our, our, our, uh, our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3547.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that we have tools in place that we're just not taking advantage of here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3553.005s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, this council really can't do much for you, but what we can do, we can work with the CPA like the city of Cambridge and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3562.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: put CPA funding to keep a mediation company on retainer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3567.313s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when these issues happen, you're not scrambling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3570.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's an avenue that you can come right here to City Hall to make sure that you're protected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3575.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that that's the beginning of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3577.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that my fellow councilor feels that what we're talking about right now, we have a group of people that are in dire need, that are afraid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3587.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I feel sympathy and I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3590.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But with, now, say no different, no different than Brooks family feels than the residents that reach out to me saying, George, I'm 78 years old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3603.917s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I lived in a fixed income.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3605.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I own my home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3606.719s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the process that this, that society has given us has, by success, has driven the cost of my home up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3618.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now they live in a fixed income.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3620.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now what you hear, you hear a council that says, let's have rent control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3625.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's do a tenure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3626.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's do a transfer tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3627.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's do a registration fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3630.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's do an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3631.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's do... that's frightening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3633.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we're on the same boat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3635.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think you have homeowners, and this is the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3638.613s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's very, it's difficult when you have some Councilors trying to divide the community by calling things fear tactics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3645.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3647.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People are scared because it's the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3649.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you own that home and you live there, and you didn't expect your $18,000 home you bought 35 years ago, that is now a million dollars, because some people behind this real feel like, because that house is worth a million dollars, that person that owns that house and that has to live there every day, that that's a wealthy person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3669.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, it's the same person that's sitting back here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3672.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the same person with the same fears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3675.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So let's not divide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3677.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's try to find options like the CPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3680.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's look at the CPA for mediation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3685.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's look at our CPA tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3686.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had Councilor Marks has been preaching for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3690.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Look at the space that we have, that Medford owns, that we can sell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3698.487s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can allow building use on those small parcels that you could take that money and put it in to the affordable trust fund that, by the way, we haven't even established yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3709.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not even up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3710.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But imagine that funding coming in, that the Brooks family comes to us and says, what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3716.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're being pushed out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3719.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, we could plant the seed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3722.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But listen, I can also go get an oak and bring it right here and plop it right down the middle of this forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3728.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there are avenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3730.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So don't don't let's let's be honest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3733.636s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I fear and I will work as hard as I can for this organization because I hate to see people leaving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3739.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3741.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same time, you can't look at the other side and say, it's all your fault.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3745.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're gonna move you out so everybody's in that boat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3749.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to find the common ground that we can all work together to make sure that we all want affordable housing, that people aren't scared to leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3758.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure, listen, I think that one thing we should focus on is look at the developers that are coming into the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3766.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: find a way that we have legislation behind us that would protect owners that or renters that live in their home that are being pushed out for for total gain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3777.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I agree, I'm going to support you 1000%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3780.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I'm going to make the motion that we ask us a CPA organization to fund a mediation retainer right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3790.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because again, as much as we all have good intentions back here, we don't have the power<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3795.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to do what needs to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3797.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, we had Councilor Caraviello come here today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3800.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He worked all last week on an 88-year-old woman that was being displaced, who has cancer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3806.77s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he came up to City Hall to ask for help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3808.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And do you know what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3810.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing, because nobody answered the call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3814.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a City Councilor that's worked his tail off to make sure he's protecting a resident of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3819.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we all understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3821.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is where the unity comes in instead of saying that, oh, this is this and this is that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3827.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to figure out a way to make sure affordable housing is done correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3831.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we use the avenues that we already have in place here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3834.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just haven't tapped into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3836.466s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3868.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3871.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have the right to point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3890.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you're ready, when you're ready, point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3895.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With the gavel today, I see where it's coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3896.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But a point of information, I will tell you, the misinformation that's going out there was a letter signed by two of the leaders in this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3907.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's exactly what's scaring people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3909.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because it's actually actions not it's not words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3912.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's actions and your actions were something totally opposite<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3917.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, then why haven't we had the meeting on the tenure on the transfer tax then?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3920.796s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why haven't we have committee on the transfer tax so we can point out and pick out what you just said, Councilor Bears?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3925.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if you came out and we sat as a community and said this is what we need. Let's not let's not hurt the homeowners like you said in that in that context.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3935.048s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm for you a thousand percent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3936.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we haven't done that, have you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3991.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's one project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3992.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's one project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3996.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Speak the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3997.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You want to talk about not speaking the truth?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3999.651s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's affordable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4000.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The CPA is not phasing that out for one project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4184.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4190.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are people getting evicted?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4192.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4269.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information, just to be clear, I'll give you an example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4274.115s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Today, I talked to a homeowner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4275.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I talked to a homeowner today that has about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4282.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 18 feet that the city owns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4284.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're willing to come in and pay that 18 feet to build an addition for the senior citizen parent to move in with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4290.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know it sounds nice and it sounds powerful to say developers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4295.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not all developers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4297.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have small parcels of land that homeowners that are bought these properties that will gladly pay, that would feed our trust to help communities like we have here at the Brooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4308.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5453.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can, just if we can, what is the reasoning for that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5458.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I can understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5460.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5472.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I would follow up that the mayor and it would be great if we had a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5478.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would really focus on the city solicitor really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5481.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: paving a way for this organization so they can have a point person in the city<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5485.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they could talk, not a city council that really we can't do much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5489.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can just also request that the mayor, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5494.456s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Get involved and use her, um, executive power to see what we can do to assist this organization. Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5508.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5522.423s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5523.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to at least investigate, maybe send the subcommittee that we can look at, you know, a request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5535.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: OK, so maybe we change that just that we look to send this to subcommittee, that we invite the CPA in to see what that would entail, to make that a piece of the puzzle that one of our residents did say that put another tool in the toolbox with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5804.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5983.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure, my amendment would be that, now again, this would be the whole presentation, so this is a little odd and a little bothersome to me as a city council, but I will tell you what we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5996.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The amendment will be that I would look for the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6000.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the city council to ask the mayor make sure we get it right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6008.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would like to make sure that we make a motion for the mayor to appropriate $5 to $7 million needed to level the school budget through the free cash<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6023.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: through free cash and by the process that we first take that, make that as an appropriation before free cash is certified and we announce for what that is used for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6040.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now if I can, Mr. President, is that efficient?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6048.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll tell you what, Mr. President, don't appreciate it, but I will tell you, the question that we had was the, Mia's process and how she brought this forward and the irresponsible process that she moved forward on social media and then in city council and school committee meetings, where she talked about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6072.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the option of free cash being used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6075.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $2 million is committed to fire trucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6078.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $2.3 million is committed to an OPM design for the new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6084.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $1.2 million for OPM for the HVAC system issues at the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6089.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have to rebuild Freedom Way for $10 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6092.379s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have to fix HVAC systems in the schools for $15 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6096.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Estimates for middle school alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6098.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have to put more money on water and soil infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6100.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that good, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6101.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So can I proceed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6129.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I would present something and explain it to you and that'll get that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6132.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That'll explain it, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6170.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So not if it's time sensitive to ask a motion to entertain this before the certified, the free cash is certified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6215.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's called,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6218.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: shutting it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6219.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's used,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6224.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it's an episode used to do that. Shame on you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6264.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6327.159s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6328.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, this is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6331.91s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate for my fellow colleagues to help me express what I've been hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6338.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm not going to get into what was said earlier, because I think that that's why we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6344.717s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the communications that I received from residents with the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6351.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, the discussions of rent control and the, you know, the 2% tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6358.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're talking about, you know, the registry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6362.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then we're talking about what the mayor has presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6365.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What she said was a 2.5% override, which by the way, publicly, I will tell you, I'm not opposed to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6373.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She talked about debt exclusions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6375.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not opposed to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6377.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I publicly say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6378.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was one of the only Councilors that brought a debt exclusion to this body that they've never done it before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6384.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it was voted down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6386.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I understand this process we need to follow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6389.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what comes to mind is I've said it over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6395.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we heard it tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6397.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Until we exhaust<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6399.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: until we exhaust everything in our pockets that we can show that we're not making mistakes and just being reactionary on taxation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6414.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because I've identified many, many different options that the mayor hasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6418.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've met with the building department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6419.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are no permits out there for any sort of development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6422.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I say development, I speak of the development that everybody talks about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6426.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just had a conversation about it, about affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6429.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor lost 600 affordable housing units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6433.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But more importantly, she lost a huge tax bracket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6437.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She lost a huge, between 3 to 5 million, just in one building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6443.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for permits and fees, one building, and look who we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6448.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Look at the problems we're having right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6450.907s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this tactic by the mayor, by putting this out there, is something quick and easy for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6457.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's done nothing for five years, honestly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6459.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The Beer Hall is her claim to fame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6461.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We really haven't moved the city forward at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6463.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're not bringing new revenue at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6468.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so now what I'm getting to my point very simply is this, I didn't, I wouldn't support a rainy day account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6476.763s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as I look at the options now, and the options I see have to be really expressed and understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6485.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because a lot of people that have come to me, they're not against working together for an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6492.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're not against working together for a debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6496.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but they want the data to prove it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6500.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They wanna see, are we doing it right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6503.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You don't just put out a tax, just a tax, just to cover your keister, because that's what she's doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6508.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that's your agenda, because you've told us this, but the bottom line is, let's listen to what that last caller said, Councilor Bears, the other night, because I think that's what brought this forward in my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6520.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She asked you,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6523.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She asked you, Mr. President, what if the override doesn't pass?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6529.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What if it doesn't?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6530.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you said, right, it's going to devastate our school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6534.91s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The vote is in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6536.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it feels, it affects our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6541.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It affects our teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6543.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It affects our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6545.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And even if it's a 1% chance that that override would fail, are we willing to gamble our students' educational process for this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6556.297s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like I said, we can look at, as a council, bringing forth the rainy day account that the mayor asked for, we appropriate it correctly, we earmark that money, and everything goes level funding to schools, and maybe she can't do the Freedom Way for another year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6576.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at least that now brings two groups, and that's what it is right now, the people that don't want Proposition 2.5 override, and people that do want the Proposition override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6588.822s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what we can do is take that time to sit together and probably, because I know Councilor Bears said it, there's a finance group that's been working since last April, I believe he said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6600.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with the mayor, I'm sorry, September, the mayor, the chief of staff, Councilor Bears, Council President Bears, Council Vice President Collins, and school committee member, Jenny Graham, excuse me, Vice Chair Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6615.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the five of them have been working on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6617.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the question that everybody's been saying is, well,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6622.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What have they worked on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6623.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know Councilor Bears said, when it's time, they'll put everything out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6627.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But for right now, we don't have that time to wait and put it out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6630.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because right now, are we willing to gamble our students' future next year on a possibility of this divide not making it happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6644.855s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I know I got people emailing me saying that something went out on a social media site and shame on you, George Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6651.621s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm one person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6653.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm one person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6655.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as I read it, the question was, is this a fair tactic by the school committee and the mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6663.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Of course it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6665.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Of course it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6666.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because there were no other avenue presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6669.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was only one avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6671.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We did nothing for five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6674.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: On June 20th of 2023, the budget meeting, I sat here and said, you're going to destroy our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6682.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We are going to be in financial ruins if you pass this budget just because you want to get elected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6688.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're going to use ARPA money, which by the way, which by the way, I use ARPA money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6694.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're told specifically,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6696.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: do not use ARPA money unless it's sustainable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6699.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, our mayor took that money and the ESSA money, and the school committee did, and they've level funded a budget just to get elected because she didn't want a black eye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6708.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's say what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6710.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But here we are today now, here we are today ready to gamble on our children's future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6717.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's not a scare tactic, that's legitimate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6720.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If the override does not pass,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6723.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: then quote unquote, our schools will be devastated with layoffs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6730.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're gonna hurt teachers, we're gonna hurt children, and we're gonna destroy this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6735.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I implore my fellow Councilors to please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6739.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: follow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6740.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's put the motion through that we ask the mayor to bring through a rainy day account that we appropriate the funds needed to level fund the school budget and make sure that everybody is whole because that was another question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6755.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I got a phone call from school committees where they were astonished the other day that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6759.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that the chair, I think, was astonished because her answer was, no, everything goes back to the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6765.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the superintendent sat in front of us the other day, and I've got calls from teachers, I've got calls, that's not true, they said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6772.105s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, it's manipulating for what they should do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6775.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're not being transparent enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6778.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I please, I implore you to let's, let's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6783.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's focus on free cash, level fund this budget, let's build on our children's future, and then work on if we really need an override and debt exclusions, and then work together as a community to make sure it passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6797.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6849.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Shame on you. Shame on you. You're just a bully with a gavel. You're a bully with a gavel. You're out of line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6857.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You let me answer. I have the right to point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6868.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're willing to gamble on kids' future on an override instead of looking at real money that our residents, that the mayor mismanaged and left out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6878.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Bottom line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6937.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can't, we can't move forward and discuss it and the mayor can't move forward to look at the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6951.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=483.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: President Piazza, my question might not be for you, Mr. O'Connor, but I'm looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=487.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I might have missed it, but I know that we lost a valuable member of our team here to a new position, but our outreach manager for prevention and outreach,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=504.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you know if we're filling that position or if it's been filled?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=507.362s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, that's great, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=510.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, will it be under your department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=512.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=513.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=514.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Obviously, big shoes to fill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=516.186s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was amazing, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=517.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=518.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, that's all I had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=518.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=894.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, any questions, Councilor Scarpelli?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=895.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=897.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, Connor, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=898.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=899.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know I mentioned it to the chief of staff on Saturday, we did the tour of the fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=904.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have we connected with the auxiliary group and told them that we're moving on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=919.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so still might proceed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=931.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they wouldn't need the trucks and all the apparatus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=935.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I know the chief was also reaching out to let them know that they're trying to find there was some equipment that they said that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=941.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=942.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=942.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=943.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3027.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3030.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First let me disclose that I do have a family member that is a teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3037.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've contacted the Ethics Commission and the protocol is that I can be present because we're not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3045.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: discussing any votes, so I will not hide in a side chair or anything like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3050.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll stand in front, and you can ask any questions if you, you know, and I'll respond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3057.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The way the process goes, I was told to inform the public, because it was a little confusing yesterday, that the night of the budget meeting, that when we go to vote,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3067.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will ask when we get to the school department budget that we sever elementary education piece to be voted separately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3075.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll exclude myself, the council will vote on that part, and then I can come back in to be part of the procedure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3082.719s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that there was some confusion of what the process is when you have a family member that's in the system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3089.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I appreciate,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3093.922s">[Scarpelli]</a>: your presence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3094.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that Councilor Bears made a presentation about where we are right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3102.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will share the conversation on June 20th of last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3107.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I felt like Nostradamus, Mr. McHugh, because I sat in front of this body and I explained how tragic and how devastating, if we funded the budget the way that we were going last year, where would we be today?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3121.814s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3123.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's happening, and there's nothing we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3127.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My fellow councilors, like Councilor Behr said, did meet behind closed doors with the mayor and came up with a plan with another member of the council to set up this financial group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3142.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This financial group, I guess, has been meeting since April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3145.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are you part of that financial group?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3151.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So is Mr. Dickinson part of that group?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3154.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our city financial director?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3160.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so on a day to day basis during these meetings, I don't I don't I don't see any minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3166.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wouldn't know what's going on those meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3168.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I do know is that they've been meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3170.65s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we've come to a conclusion over after knowing for a year over a year now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3176.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because it was publicly stated, we're gonna be in drastic, drastic financial need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3181.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we've known in a year, and I'm gonna ask some questions about that later, but we've known for years that we are in a devastating situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3190.779s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We knew we were gonna be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3192.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we've heard back was the mayor announced that we're gonna look at debt exclusion and overrides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3200.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: which is very, very irresponsible for the fact that when other communities present overrides or debt exclusions, it's part of a transparent process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3212.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: where it's discussed, it's presented so the community and as a whole understands what this process looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3219.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What happened that evening when the mayor pronounced after you said, I believe that you were talking that we were gonna have a $5.5 million shortfall and the man jumped back and said, it's the first time I heard of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3232.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I only thought it was $500,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3235.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Really, they've had a working groups in September and that's the first time they've heard that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3239.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So as we move forward with this process,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3242.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're seeing the mayor present that evening that we're now going to focus on this working group that is going to look into an override and debt exclusions to get us to where we need to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3254.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Irresponsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3256.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been saying this for over a year now, more than a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3259.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The lack of transparency and the mismanagement of finances in this community is pitiful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3266.045s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the reason why we're here today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3268.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can look at zero new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3270.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can look at confusing payments to law firms that when I did my numbers from the actuals, over $470,000 paid to KP Law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3284.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're seeing lawsuits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3287.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're hearing all these different issues and why we are where we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3290.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm going to be honest with you, I don't disagree with my fellow colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3294.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My number one priority is to fund the school system where it needs to be so we can do the best we can for the most important people in our community, that's our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3303.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I support it a thousand percent, but it's how we get there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3307.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what's frightening to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3309.351s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because right now, I don't see a transparent process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3312.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have a few Councilors and a school kid member working together with the mayor and the chief of staff without any financial professional with them on a day-to-day basis, and the mayor comes out and says, after these cuts, I'm gonna look for a debt exclusion, and I'm gonna look for looking at an override to balance our budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3330.518s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, absolutely not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3331.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a way to do it, and I'll get to that when I speak, when she comes to this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3335.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what I understand, so I can understand this transparent process, if you can allow me to expand on this, is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3342.827s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Where are these questions coming from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3344.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I bring up the point that I have some bullets that parents, teachers, administrators, myself come up with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3354.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The process that why do we not have faith?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3358.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, there was a Monday we got an email saying that there was a shortfall in the FY 24 budget of 2.5 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3365.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then on Friday, hey, we found 2.2 million or so, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3369.423s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Where did that come from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3371.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we still, I asked for a report much back in understanding that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3376.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if you can allude to that, that'd be great for the first question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3494.518s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if it can't to that point of information, Mr. President, I think we agree that I think that we've talked not getting the information that you need, but what that evening on June 20th of last year, I think the biggest problem was the lack of information given to the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3509.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the complete council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3511.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to be honest with you, even with this financial group, you keep saying the leadership, we talked about this last year, the leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3519.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, did you think maybe that getting us just monthly reports on what that leadership was working on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3526.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because we didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3528.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And these are the things that I'm saying when I say, well, lack of transparency, that brings me to the first question that we talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3533.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if you can speak to I appreciate I can give a quick recap on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3659.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so with that being said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3665.949s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have to understand, I'm not blaming you, I think just understanding it, I think understanding you coming in in August wasn't the best, it's not the best fit, so I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3675.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, correct me if I'm wrong, you don't work five days a week, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3678.821s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're a consultant that works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3721.553s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I just think that this is working three days with this type of budget and what you had to recover from, it's not fair to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3728.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It wasn't fair to you at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3793.917s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you were well aware, Mr. McHugh, that we were in financial disaster ahead of us, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3804.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I'm saying when you got here, I'm only saying this because I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3810.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a school department that knew and a city mayor that knew last year that we were going to get to this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3819.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I can speak firsthand being on the school committee when we had some huge cuts and you had to stand up and be a big boy and big girl and stand in front of everybody and tell them what they don't want to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3833.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3834.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we're looking at a situation where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3838.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we did this year, Madam Superintendent, I think we did a terrible job in making sure that we tightened that belt and made sure that we did everything possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3850.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we get to this point, we wouldn't be this bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3854.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, to that point, you know, usually we get a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3858.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was accustomed to always get the school committee budget, even as a city councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3862.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I love the point, but I'd love an actual budget if you can get that to me, because I like to look into the pieces that you don't hear about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3870.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How much money do we spend on consultants?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3872.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How much money do we spend on people that we could have moved over to other positions and people could have picked up other spots?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3882.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I work with,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3884.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Superintendent Belson, I realize he's probably the cream of the crop, but when we had drastic cuts in 08, the first group he went after was his leadership team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3894.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he said, well, I'm gonna feel the pain first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3897.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm glad to see that we're gonna move forward with getting to this budget of 79 million, which by the way, does that bring everybody back on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3907.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody that's cut, all the directors, would that $79 million bring all those people back to their positions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3946.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's what the misleading point of last evening and tonight is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3949.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what I got when I got the phone call this morning from parents and people saying, this is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3954.692s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So Hannah's coming back to the bench, you know, right back to her position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3957.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a big one, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3958.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, our head of physical education is going to come back, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3962.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: state mandated position, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3965.839s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're talking about secretaries, where I worked at the McGlynn School, knowing how two secretaries are important, vital to that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3975.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what I'm getting back is saying, this is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3977.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody's coming back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3978.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4003.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so in full transparency, the reason why I say this, and I don't want to put you on the spot, I wish the superintendent can help with me, but as we talk about these positions, we have to make sure that the community understands this doesn't make everybody whole again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4017.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so this is what we may have to make sure that, because people left last evening thinking, oh, this is great, we're going to get everything back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4026.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so we gotta make sure that's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4028.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still, that's still left up until to the school committee and the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4055.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I completely, completely understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4057.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what the school committee said last night is go level funded a $79 million, not for what the mayor's presenting, not as of last night, people left that meeting saying we're whole again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4068.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just don't want to be careful, Mr. President, because I don't want to come back to the city council that the city council didn't want wasn't transparent because the questions they asked me and is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4078.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4079.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4081.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So even though we get $79 million, hey, I support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4086.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like I said, I want to make sure that we're whole with the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4091.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I just want to make sure that when this happens, and let's say the mayor comes back and says, hey, we're going to go for an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4098.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that override is going to be passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4100.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you're going to get that $79 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4103.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but understand to the community that this city council made sure that everybody's aware that doesn't mean everybody's whole again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4111.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just wanted to make sure that piece was clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4228.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam Secretary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4230.761s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4231.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's exactly what I was asking, because I think that understanding and make sure we're transparent enough to say what you just said was perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4238.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hopefully, the community is listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4239.824s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when they come back and say, we're confused, so that that's a huge piece that I wanted to clarify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4245.165s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4248.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you pointing that out for us, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4250.663s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4252.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate the budget book, if you can get that for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4254.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we talked about last year and some things that were talked about were, you know, where were we losing money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4261.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have we looked at what are these shortfalls?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4265.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How do we really capture, bring those numbers back?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4269.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One being, you know, we're seeing that we're losing a lot of kids to charter school, or our kids are leaving to private school, and why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4275.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Especially at the middle school, high school level, mostly the high school level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4278.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that, you know, people realize that we do lose a lot of money when we, and then the reimbursement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4285.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can you enlighten us on what we paid the charter schools in reimbursement this year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4319.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, so we'll ask the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4321.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4322.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that the reason why I bring this up is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4326.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Back in 2008, we looked at how do we find a way to even try to figure out, because pennies start turning into quarters, quarters into dollars, dollars into hundreds, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4336.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we looked at something like the summer programming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4340.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we did, I'm proud to say that I was one of the people that brought the summer program to the MISA Tech and brought in hundreds of thousands of dollars to make sure we did that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4352.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we didn't see is one of the biggest,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4355.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: biggest needs was after-school care, before-school care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4359.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we've done the best we can without the space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4363.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But these are things that I'm looking for to say, how do we bring more revenue back into the city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4369.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And at the same time, providing a need for our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4373.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's going to be important as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4375.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's just a comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4379.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know, like again, I think that some of the biggest questions are rumors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4382.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wanted to make sure we spelled a few rumors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4386.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if you can just enlighten me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4389.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I didn't hear this, so that's why I'm trying to just figure this out, to answer this for a constituent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4394.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we cutting foreign language at the high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4397.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or is that a process, is that something that's on the table?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4459.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, and I think specifically just so you, just to be, just to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4462.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: be up front is I think that the commitment with CASIC and bringing Italian to the elementary schools, and the rumor is that maybe Italian might be the language that's being dismissed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4473.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that was one of the questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4514.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's important because I think that, I don't know if the funds have now dried up, that Miss Petrangelo, former Italian teacher, left the school district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4522.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe she left a million dollars at the time to make sure that foreign language, but mostly Italian, was something that she would leave her legacy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4532.474s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's what's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4533.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's one of the questions, one of my former teachers, so I think that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4538.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to, if we can, maybe not tonight, but just get some information on that, Madam Superintendent, because I think it's important to see if we still have that in the budget, which you donated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4547.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4569.64s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that was at the high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4588.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4589.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So like I said, I think that it's important that, you know, as I'm, the questions that I'm reading up, not just from me, they're from former teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4597.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when they hear these things, they want to make sure that the legacy of one of their former colleagues is still carried on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4601.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that, you know, I, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4607.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see so many students, my children included, that the Italian language part of their culture is very deep here in Medford, and I know that I think maybe Italian families really don't feel<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4622.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they feel a little bit slighted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4623.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's something that just for transparency purposes, just to bring forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4675.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so I just want, just so you know, just with Miss Petrangelo's funding, with what she donated, just to make sure that plays a big factor, because I think that as we move forward with this, when you have a teacher leaving a vote load of money, which is a million dollars, a lot of money, and that was some years ago, so I don't know if there's anything left in that line, but understanding that with her legacy, her former colleagues that I've talked to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4698.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: making sure her legacy is carried on, that we give her the respect, whether there's only 12 kids for Italian, we find a way to fund that class with what she left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4708.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's my point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4709.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4710.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I completely understand that there's a need base and we can all agree with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4718.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I promised Councilor President Baez that I wouldn't go line by line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4724.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I've taken enough time tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4727.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the biggest question that will be during the budget presentation with the mayor, and I think that I'll be more vocal when it comes to how I think this budget should be funded, because I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4743.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're seeing right now is something the mayor ran on in transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4748.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This community has yet to see in five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4751.541s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we've lost a lot of revenue because of, for what she has decided what's important to this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4761.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've lost millions of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4763.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We wouldn't be in this bar right now if the mayor was more transparent in the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4768.494s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just no different than this process we're in right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4771.417s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We found out<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4773.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was watching the meeting, the five o'clock meeting, and the mayor was stunned when you expressed the number, and she came back right away and said, this working group has been working on a override, Proposition 2 1⁄2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4788.105s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I only bring this up because Councilor Villes and I talked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4791.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A lot of people I've talked to that you would think that don't want an override have blatantly told me, if we can see the financial picture, and is it true?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4800.512s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Does the data prove that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4803.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we had new revenue, if we went with one 40B project, and if that 40B project brought in $3 million in permits, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4813.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then the new revenue, that's another $3 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4816.929s">[Scarpelli]</a>: out of that project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4818.11s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This $606 million in new growth, that's one project that we fought, which by the way, would be hundreds, hundreds of affordable housing units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4827.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the narrow minded thinking and the mismanagement of finances that we're seeing today in this community that is hurting the bottom line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4835.368s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The bottom line is scary to say it's going to be our children and our seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4839.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, Mr. McHugh, listen, I appreciate all your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4846.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have the toughest job in this whole city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4848.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You were given a pile of junk, and they said, OK, go to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4919.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to that point, do you see what I'm saying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4923.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To that point, Mr. McHugh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4925.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're a community that's looking at a $79 million budget line, and we truly don't understand it yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4933.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what's frightening to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4935.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We left here a year ago at this time knowing we were going to be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4941.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, another comment people ask, is the school committee still going to accept their raises?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4946.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4947.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would recommend still that we cut our pay to support that so we don't hurt the budget in any way possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4953.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But that's my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4955.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when you as the director of finance or the acting finance guru here see how drastic and how difficult this process is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4966.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Imagine what we're thinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4967.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Imagine what the residents are thinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4969.574s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Imagine the homeowner that's a senior citizen sitting back and someone's whispering in the area saying that if an override goes through and debt exclusions go through and transfer tax goes through, that homeowner is possibly looking at thousands of dollars that are going to change their lives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4987.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's the fear right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4989.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so, and I appreciate that, I hate to put you on the hot seat because you don't deserve it, but this is exactly how everybody's failing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=4996.507s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is when I say mismanagement of finances in our community, it's not your fault, but it is, we can see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5049.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, no, I think the biggest piece, I think, Councilor, is that the understanding of is in trying to recover funding in any way we can is finding a reason why we're losing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6192.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just to reiterate, I think that maybe some things are getting confused, some councils in translation, but the understanding, I appreciate you bringing this point up, that understanding to sit here and blame anybody right now doesn't get us anywhere, but to understand the process to make sure the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6213.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the bleeding stops when the same thing's being done over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6217.487s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have to identify that and being the fact that this council is in charge of making sure that financially, we're doing the best for every citizen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6228.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's important to ask us the most important questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6232.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when I bring up the fact of five years of stagnant growth, of course, that's a huge factor where we are today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6241.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Of course it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6244.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I identified one development that would have brought our community millions of dollars, and that's one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6256.041s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the key factor and the key process that I'm bringing up right now, and especially that everybody understands this, is not only with the mayor, and I brought up the council respectively, the council president from June 20th, and then even with this financial process that we're talking about with this working group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6276.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you're doing it in a bubble and we don't know what's going on, it's alarming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6284.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're in big trouble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6285.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now sure, could we have looked at a debt exclusion or overrides in the past?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6290.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6290.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This council, by the way, unlike anyone here, presented the debt exclusion for a new fire station years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6299.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And maybe one person was here that voted no on that that evening, but it didn't go anywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6305.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what I did was, I met with the financial director, who by the way, as award winning financial director, and Aleesha Nunley, and she presented a breakdown of that debt exclusion to educate everybody to understand where it fell, where it fell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6324.917s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And at the time it was $17 per household a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6329.824s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with excluding senior citizens and veterans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6333.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I understand completely what this council is looking to do, but it's how are we doing it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6341.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And understanding that maybe pointing the finger has to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6348.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe people understanding because you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6351.574s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To get this passed, if we really need it, we need everybody involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6358.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need everybody to see the light.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6364.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because all this is doing right now is further dividing this community, this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6370.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not that we don't need it, because I've already addressed that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6372.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that if it's done properly and the data proves it, and we can say, well, let's say we have four developments ready to go in the next year and a half.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6388.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're ready to pull the trigger instead of fighting and going to court and denying and denying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6394.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, maybe that's revenue that we wouldn't be sitting here right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6399.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to my colleagues, we have to identify that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6403.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we do have to look at pointing because that's our job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6408.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have to figure out where the mistakes have happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6411.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they don't happen again, like Councilman said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6415.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this isn't sour grapes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6416.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I grew up in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6418.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I taught in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6420.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I coach in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6422.016s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I own a home in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6424.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I raised two kids in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6427.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was in the school committee for eight years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6428.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been the council now for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6433.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've seen the ups and downs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6435.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand that things are underfunded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6440.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if we do it correctly, everybody can get involved in this, and everybody can support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6446.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when it's coming the way it's coming out right now, and it's irresponsible, the process was irresponsible to date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6455.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And Council Bears and I have talked about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6457.526s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He doesn't disagree in the sense that he wished things came out differently, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6462.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've talked about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6464.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's the process that constituents<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6469.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe not some people's, but constituents that reach out to me, make sure I express that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6475.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we look at every avenue possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6479.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe talking to mayor and saying, okay, let's look at this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6482.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's look at this right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6484.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we can do today to fund our schools, to get them level funded, so they're not hurting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6489.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6491.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: pause, get the information that we need, the proper information that we need, the data that we need, that everybody can marry and understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6499.466s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6501.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We do need a debt exclusion for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6503.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We do need an override for this amount of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6506.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not saying not to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6509.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would firmly believe if the data shows and everybody's part of the process, because I said this at the beginning, the difference that you're seeing in communities that have passed overrides,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6521.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Communities were informed, they were part of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6525.764s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm good friends with a former mayor that is probably someone that I put on the top of the mountain when it comes to mayors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6535.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I explained this to him, he says, well, explain the breakdown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6539.695s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How was it presented?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6542.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I said, well, it wasn't presented, it was just mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6546.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How irresponsible?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6548.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So fellow consulate might not take what I'm saying as that they take respect toward it or they feel that it's not needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6559.187s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, it is needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6560.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because that's what people put us in for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6563.692s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would never tell anybody here not to express your thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6570.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But these are the thoughts that we can bring everybody together and find a way to get where we need to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6575.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And like I said, if it's a debt exclusions, if it's overrides, I think there's a way to get there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6581.621s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7636.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7638.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm glad to see that our Chief of Staff has<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7642.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: like commender.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7643.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's coming here as she usually does and stands up and defends the mayor because that seems like that's been common practice with our chief of staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7653.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will tell you the numbers that I shared a numbers that were given to us by her office and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7665.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe there was a comment a few weeks ago that the law line item was $50,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7671.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That wasn't true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7673.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you do the actuals and you count it up at the time for that one year that we did have, which we expressed is a question because we're seeing the mismanagement of financial process here in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7691.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You can blame COVID again, but that's getting old because as Medford's fighting about COVID, I could talk about communities too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7699.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I won't talk about, I won't give you numbers from Athol, Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7704.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm gonna talk about our neighboring communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7707.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Malden, flourishing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7709.548s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everett, flourishing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7711.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Somerville, flourishing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7713.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: New growth everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7716.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're touting a beer hall on Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7722.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we talk about transparency, there has been huge lack of transparency from that office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7731.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even the fact that what I heard the other night, looking back at the meeting, that a city solicitor is not important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7740.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a disgrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7741.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The city solicitor works for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7748.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's that check and balance, that person's that checks and balance for the city, for this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7755.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's a lot to be said in what's going on, because when it's time, everything will come out when the mayor is here, because I think that that's one thing people are missing, is that when things are tough, I believe she said that to Councilor Caraviello when he ran against her for mayor, saying that Mr. Caraviello doesn't want to make tough decisions, he wants to say yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7779.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, guess what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7782.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's been tough for the last five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7785.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we haven't seen much happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7787.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you can blame the pandemic, you can blame whatever you want to say, you can look at whatever numbers you want to look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7795.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the truth is in what we live in every single day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7798.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You might not understand that because you don't live in metric.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7803.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but no, no, no, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7804.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a valid point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7806.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're touting something that and not understanding what the community has expressed to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7814.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So don't be a little bad, to me at least.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7816.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, the understanding that when the mayor gets here at budget evening, we'll go over it, we'll discuss it, we'll debate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7829.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because we're here for, we're here, like we said, in a more mutual understanding process, is that we understand that there's a process that we might need a form of overrides or debt exclusions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7847.048s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I don't think it's done in a transparent manner, I've mentioned it, I'll say it over again, and I'll stand by that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7853.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I sat with this mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7858.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and what she worked with sitting next to me for years isn't the person that's trying to run the city right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=7870.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=9348.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll do respect to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=9350.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the hard work people are doing, and I understand keeping them on right now, but I think as we move forward, I think it's important that we give the opportunities for Medford residents to take those positions, so I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=9376.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're advisory committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=9377.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=9378.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Take it all back then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=9379.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=9380.164s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1516.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm good for now, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1518.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3780.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3781.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you very much for all your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3783.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You can see the impact because of, I think that, oh boy, when you first started, we were calling the office on a daily basis and now we don't have many calls and that says a lot about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3797.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: department that, you know, unfortunately, people look at like, it's evil.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3804.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So but we know, we get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3818.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3819.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that the only question I had is I remember that we had talked in the past that for your comfort, I know that your office was a little.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3829.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How can I say it was underwhelming?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3833.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have we done any anything to support you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3836.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And in your comfort level in your department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3838.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that have we done anything to help with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3857.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, well, I think whatever, whatever we're doing, there's got to be there's got to be a solution where we can find<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3866.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, hopefully find a more suitable location for you, especially as we're growing and as you're taking on pretty important pieces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3873.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, I know that it doesn't sound like a lot, but just doing the passes for projects or for moving, that's going to be a very busy office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3884.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, you know, and if you look at neighboring communities,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3888.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Boy, they're standalone buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3891.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And from what I recall, yours is possibly a cubicle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3894.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would hope that we a little bit more proactive and finding you a better location or another space in the building where you have that space that you and your staff deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3908.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just wanted to share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=4009.548s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=4012.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=4013.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Facetiously, maybe we should maybe make an office move from city solicitor's office and the traffic and parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=4020.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe that might work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=4232.763s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=4233.364s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=4234.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I should have brought this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=4234.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And director reminded me that on the on the appeals process, I know that is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=4242.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I haven't really had a chance to look through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=4244.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And someone just mentioned it this afternoon, and wanted me to ask a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=4248.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=4249.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it just people that the talk the talk around Medford again with the appeal process being something to the tune of $250?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=1626.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=1627.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Tonight is a great example of what Method truly is about, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=1631.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have, tonight was just, we haven't had many of these in a long time, but this was a love fest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=1637.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I, you know, this is what Method's all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=1639.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So a group that was started a few years back, the CCSR, we have one of our leaders here, Mr. Richard Trotter is here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=1651.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=1653.427s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when we heard about this story, and then we saw it on TV, and then you see it in action, because, you know, it sounds, well, that's cute, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=1665.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then all of a sudden, our postal worker walked down the street with the whistle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=1671.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, and you see what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=1673.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there are some dangers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=1675.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sadly, there are dangers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=1677.016s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we had two fifth graders that decided that they wanted to do something about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=1681.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's easy just to sit back and do nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=1684.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is what's exciting when you have a fifth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=1688.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to fifth graders that can reach out to this school, that can reach out to an organization like CCSR, and then provide an avenue that they can do something really, really, really moving, and something that really shows the city and shows their friends and shows everybody that you take an initiative,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=1706.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because you care, because you see something and you want to fix something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=1710.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I give them our friends a lot of credit for what they've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=1714.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm so happy they're here tonight with their families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=1716.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=1751.705s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Come on up, Savannah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3115.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3116.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3117.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think this is the process that... No, you... Sorry, this is the... So I think that the process we're seeing is on point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3128.681s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3130.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, I personally didn't see any violations myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3134.34s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that this is just an example for our newer Councilors that voted against legal response for my question from last couple of weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3145.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What that triggers now is the public asking for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3151.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: their opinion okay so what happens is so I did reach out to legal opinion just just point of information that it's because we have absence of a city solicitor I it shouldn't be a motion it's just a request the administration so it doesn't need it doesn't need um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3169.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a passing of the council if a sitting member of this council asks for a legal opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3174.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that'll be brought up again and I'll just ask the questions that I had at our previous meeting with any legal questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3182.466s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's the process that works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3183.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, what we're seeing is the lack of a city solicitor really hinders a lot of issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3188.911s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3192.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This situation will be handled by a city solicitor, and we probably wouldn't have to pay more money to a outside law firm to rule on this, which is pretty self-explanatory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3204.304s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm glad it worked out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3207.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, just a point of information that's gonna be down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3214.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's important that we know as a council, if you have a question legally,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3218.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you could just refer it to the city administration to get legal opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3222.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3480.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3480.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Petition is here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3486.698s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3488.079s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for waiting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3488.859s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, we appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3490.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now, taking over the existing business that's there, are you changing ownership or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3517.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, so this is your existing business?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3520.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you just want to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3526.824s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you want to sell cars?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3528.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3531.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This wasn't clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3532.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that that is there a lot there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3535.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3536.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't see that there's a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3538.928s">[Scarpelli]</a>: at that location where you can just you can, you can show the cars, is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3560.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: where are you gonna store these?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3561.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have to help me understand that your auto body shop doesn't have any exterior parking for display of used cars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3575.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Where?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3589.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not clear, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3591.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's, you know, I think your petition's a little misleading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3596.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why it's a little, when I looked, I looked at the address of 26 R Mystic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3604.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's an auto body shop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3606.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, but it's a side street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3612.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, so I don't, there isn't, what I'm saying is, you're saying now there's another address that you bring your used cars?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3627.191s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3634.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As I did my research and what I saw is that I didn't see that, so I would have to see what I could do here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3643.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I looked at Google Maps and I drew by, so I'm trying to figure out where.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3663.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, if you can, because I don't see parking there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3666.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't see a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3669.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the biggest issue we have in those areas are parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3673.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And whenever, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3677.78s">[Scarpelli]</a>: just to the fact that overflow from auto body shops park their cars temporarily on the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3682.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3683.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to affect that business, but if you're putting in placing used car there and just sitting there, you know, and on the street, I can't, I couldn't support that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3708.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Inside this building?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3710.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3711.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what do you do in the building?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3713.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's an auto body building inside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3740.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, if I can, I think instead of wasting time, what I do is I'd like to maybe send the code enforcement officer and ask them to go visit that, because I don't see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3750.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think if you're doing business for auto body, you need the indoor space for auto body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3757.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That means if you're gonna take spots inside, where are you gonna move the cars that you're working on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3763.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Outside, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3826.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I just don't want to deny it, if we don't know enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3830.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can table it till May 28 meeting or enough time for everybody to do their due diligence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4467.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4469.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I did have one of the other pieces that we wanted to have a meeting with the code enforcement officer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4475.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He reported back to us that there has been no issues or concerns in that neighborhood surrounding Pinky's for any of their business issues that have been fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4490.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that was one of the concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4492.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I did talk to the owner and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4496.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I made some recommendations after talking with the neighbors, and again, this is their decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4502.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I leave it to the owner to give us an idea of what they might be looking at, and then we can move from there, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4633.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think I know that we've been talking with the neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4636.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know if they're on right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4742.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4745.165s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would know that the neighbors we talked about either two or three days appreciate the petitioner working with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4754.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we did decide is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4757.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll do a 30-day, 60-day review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4759.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then what the neighbors did ask, because Tufts might be their number one, that we just ask the code enforcement office, when school's back in session, to maybe take a closer look at that area and making sure that the process is fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4775.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I'd like to hear from the neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4777.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is a good compromise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5022.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, October 1 to get a quick, after the Tufts opens up, we say October 1 for another report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5100.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think Mr. DiRico is just an amazing individual, and anything he says is like diamonds flowing from my heart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5109.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: from his tongue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5913.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5913.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this resolution comes up because of a conversation with a very educated constituent, and he's here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5922.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Guest on is, we had a discussion, we talked about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5926.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I did some reading, and you realize that the negative effect that this puts on, especially, I looked at the fact of a senior citizen that was having issues with their taxes, and then finding a way to get out of it by selling their home, and then coming back and taking,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5951.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the whole property instead of what is owed to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5953.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that this is something this council should support and send some<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5961.949s">[Scarpelli]</a>: ascended to state legislators for their understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5966.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that we had, after our council speak, I know that I'd like for a community member to come up and really give his professional opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=13.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=1446.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=1446.822s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Tseng, thank you very much for all your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=1449.764s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is well done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=1451.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that this is needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=1456.247s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we need to really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=1458.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, I think that I'll be making the recommendation for all of our future commissions to make sure that part of the membership appointment removal organization, there's a section in there that says that the members have to be residents of the city of Medford to make sure that that is spelt out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=1477.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then the other piece is the independent resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=1480.911s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's a slippery slope when we say that we provide adequate funding to retain its own council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=1486.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This just, it just leads away from something that I'm fearing is that we're still not really going all in with the city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=1494.621s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think if we put a city with, you know, the council with partnership with the city solicitor or their designee,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=1509.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think providing funding differently opens up another concern that we hear over and over again is in the community is where are where is all of our legal money going and what we're seeing even with our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=1526.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our warrants, it's more than, for what I've counted so far, it's over $400,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=1533.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just want to make sure we keep a tight leash on that if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=1539.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But thank you for all your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2818.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2820.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2822.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the previous resolution that I voted no on, and I'll probably vote no on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2831.766s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're making decisions where usually in the past, I know that this council here today, I'm the only one that's actually been part of a council with the city solicitor, sees the importance of that answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2846.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know my fellow councilors don't believe in spending money with KP Law, so requesting any<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2854.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: questions to go their way, I think I feel reluctant to vote on anything without understanding legal ramifications or what we should be directed by legal counsel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2868.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, we can talk all we want until we find ourselves in a tricky situation where we're then called on the carpet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2874.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then because of those situations, we're then brought to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2882.148s">[Scarpelli]</a>: court for legal issues, and then it's blown up 30 fold, like the BJ situation a few years back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2890.474s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I would in the past have recommended to get legal counsel, but that's not the privy of this council anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2901.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So just wanted to share my two cents with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yQHm3T4_jqM&t=2905.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oQhgxoJb8UA&t=1676.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oQhgxoJb8UA&t=1676.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate your...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oQhgxoJb8UA&t=1680.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: description.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oQhgxoJb8UA&t=1681.165s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The question I have is something that comes up every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oQhgxoJb8UA&t=1684.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With the Action Boston Community Development, the ABCD program, I think we had a problem, if you remember, that focused on making sure that this money was spent in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oQhgxoJb8UA&t=1698.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, if you could just make sure that that happens, to approve this money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oQhgxoJb8UA&t=1702.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know in the past, they weren't very clear that if it was going to Boston, if it was going to other communities, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oQhgxoJb8UA&t=1708.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Boston and other communities have different avenues, and I think this is, you know, when we talk about Medford, we just want to be clear that this money is earmarked for Medford residents and Medford concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oQhgxoJb8UA&t=1720.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=937.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=937.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much, Director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=939.168s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that this is so exciting, hearing so many positive moves from our HR department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=949.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe this might have been for the Executive Council President, but I just might have forgotten, but any movement or any thoughts of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=962.822s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know one of our strong initiatives is the City Solicitor and the Assistant City Solicitor's position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=968.827s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have we talked about maybe increasing that CAF to bring in candidates who will actually look at that as an appealing position?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=976.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's really low and from the people that I've talked to they won't even consider even applying in Bedford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=983.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this might not be for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=987.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this conversation, but I did want to put it on our to-do list if we can, whether it's a form of a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=995.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I didn't want to leave this out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=998.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's an important agenda piece that we focus on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1020.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1021.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1477.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that may be- Yeah, sorry about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1480.297s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was up before, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2066.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I'm sorry, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2067.913s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I put my hand up and direct your answer to the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2070.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3319.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3321.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think my biggest thing, as we've talked over the years, is the staffing and what, you know, it seems to be that every time we have an initiative, it's always, well, we'll put the building department on it, or we'll put the health department on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3338.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know something that came about in conversations of a possibility, and, you know, especially looking into this year's budget,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3348.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a little concerning to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3349.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we, if we, the council did move forward with a registry for our landlords and renters, do we have the capacity for staffing in your department to oversee that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3420.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the walking the line on the answer, but I think that it's concerning to me that, and probably not to be answered today, but I probably will ask when we come to the final budget, when we look at the building department's budget and asking and realizing the responsibilities with this type of rollout.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3441.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know you kind of skimmed over it, but I don't want to disrespect you in any way, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3447.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it's a monumental, um, process to be, uh, policing, um, all these properties and making sure, especially when you're talking about the fines that you see that might be implemented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3461.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, because I think then that leaves us into some liabilities, some equity issues that, um, are we covering, are we doing our job?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3470.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do we have the staffing to do our job?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3473.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I, but like, again, I, I appreciate, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3478.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the answer, but I will let you know that I'll probably ask a little bit more in-depth questioning with some more guidance as we move forward because it looks like it might be an initiative that this council might bring down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3492.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we don't have the staffing, I can't see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3496.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe in the meeting that we had that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3501.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Your department supported it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3503.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why it was little.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3505.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We were told by a correct me if I'm wrong, Council President, that it was stated at the meeting that the building department is actually that you actually initiated that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3517.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the process of looking into this and implementing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3520.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'd like to get a little more depth later on to see how we can manage this with the staffing that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3532.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3533.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=5447.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, President Biz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=5449.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to follow up with Vice President Collins was saying, I just want to just echo what was just said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=5457.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that what you're doing as a one man team, one person team, I think is just phenomenal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=5464.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I just want to highlight something that we've heard yesterday and again today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=5471.437s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the initiatives that we're seeing that your office and recreation and what we're trying to do with disability acts and what we're trying to do for programming for disabilities and and our adaptive programming, I think is as a super surprise and excitement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=5492.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just wanted to share that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=5494.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And thank you for all your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=67.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Make the motion to join both resolutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=110.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=111.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, this is, um, this is another, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=116.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: another process where you see the CCSR program assisting young people with innovative ideas that give back to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=126.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had two fifth graders that saw the need after witnessing the holdup of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=137.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: one of the mail carriers on TV, and I believe they took it upon themselves, both Savannah and Adam, two Brooks students, to find a way to assist our mail carriers for their safety and providing them with whistles for, and this is so, it sounds so simple, but it's the minds of great,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=163.427s">[Scarpelli]</a>: two great individuals that were raised the right way, that saw a need and they stepped up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=168.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In typical Medford fashion, this is what makes Medford Medford, that we have young people seeing the need for something, reaching out to their school and the CCSR to really put something together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=185.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we should all celebrate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=188.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd make the motion that we invite them to our next meeting and hopefully give them a citation and really applaud their effort for what they've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=199.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=201.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sure you have much to say as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=382.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=383.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is an amazing resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=386.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I thought that, you know, if you all leadership, and we brought it up, I just thought that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=392.29s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a resolution for a great person, even before Rick Caraviello put his name out there to run for mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=399.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Rick, as a Medford Mustang and a committed member of this community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=411.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with no fanfare.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=412.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think no one really would have known what Rick has done if he didn't run for mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=416.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they use it as platforms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=417.855s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know Rick, he was very taken back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=420.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He didn't want to talk about the things he did, because Rick Caraviello was the person that did everything when nobody was looking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=429.171s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and he didn't want anybody to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=431.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's what's amazing about the person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=433.953s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And being named the citizen of the year, I think is an amazing award for an amazing person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=441.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the fact that if I had the opportunity to go to the banquet, listen to him speak, and you see the names on that list of the former, the former,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=454.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, honorees of that award, and you see the greatness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=458.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I say the greatness, it's just people giving back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=463.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's just people loving Medford, and people giving back to the community, and especially those people that give back when no one's looking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=470.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we have a few people here, I think Rick Orlando's here, one person is a former award winner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=477.716s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=480.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is, this is for someone I'm glad Zach brought this up that I'd like Rick to come out and I think we should really honor him, even if I know he's going to be a little bit quicker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=490.666s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He had knee replacement, so he'll get to the, he'll get to the podium a little quicker, but, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=496.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, I'm honored to call him my friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=498.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm honored that I got to serve with him on this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=501.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm honored that I got to watch him help so many and teach me that selflessness to just give back when no one's watching and see the impacts it made in people's lives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=514.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that he read a few stories that people wanted to read because of his award.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=520.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you realize the impact that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=523.223s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that he never intended to make and how moving it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=527.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to my friend, congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=530.548s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I would love to invite him, Council President, to our next meeting and him and his lovely wife, Carol, because I know that if it wasn't for Carol, he wouldn't be able to do all those selfless things that he's done for this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=546.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1426.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1427.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe that if I can, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1429.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I apologize, because I couldn't get on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1433.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was listening and I couldn't get on to the last second and I apologize for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1437.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I know that engineer Olin said that we're looking at substantial figures, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1443.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What, $6 million a year to catch up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1487.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Could we just have a 24.015 and 24.073?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1487.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I won't be supporting that paper, so I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1820.532s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that we see that for our Snappy Patty petition,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1826.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, they're looking for the extended hours just for Thursday, Friday and Saturday, 11 to 1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1831.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, we have, I have talked to, uh, the, uh, building inspector's office and, um, um, talk to them, uh, getting some feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1842.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: on any issues and concerns of the establishment, their well-respected establishment, and being that one of the questions we did hear from both people that were for or I didn't have anybody against that reached out, but that they've been great businesses and the fact that it doesn't abut a neighborhood, which makes it very important, I think was something we see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1868.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that if there is a petitioner here,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1872.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, Snappy Pats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1874.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1899.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, this is something that we come about many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1903.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that the petitioner comes with respect, background, no issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1909.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1911.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, I would support this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1913.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that whenever we've done this, we do put a 30 day and then a 60 day, um, uh, just to review with, uh, the building inspector just to give us any updates if they hear anything different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1925.258s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, and like, like I said, I think that, uh, I don't see anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1929.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see everything else in order, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1931.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, people have to know the approvals tonight go with the, the, the, the owner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1937.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if it's changed in any way to a different owner, then the process would have to be reassessed with the new owner of the business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1945.824s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was one of the questions that someone asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1947.705s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if anybody else has any questions, I don't see any concerns or issues with this petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2091.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I make the motion to approval with the stipulation of a 30- and 60-day review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2236.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2238.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is a petitioner here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2247.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I am waiting for, just for clarification, I am waiting for the building department<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2254.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I tried to call today just to get an update with any reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2258.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm probably going to ask the table this, or extend it to our next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2265.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I did have questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2266.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that when we've had concerns of neighbors, I think that we see you've done everything that you need to do, and we want to support you in any way we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2279.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But you're going from one extreme to the next, and being to the point that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2284.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it's in a residential neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2286.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the biggest fear, we've received multiple emails with residents that love you guys, that think that you're great, hardworking people, but at the same time, it really affects their quality of life with not people that you have control of, it's with your customers or with the shared drivers that come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2304.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: parking in front of people's homes, engines revving, music on, they run in and grab an order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2309.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they find it that it's gonna be a huge disservice for that neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2312.796s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would tend to just offer that the timing to two o'clock in the morning, I wouldn't personally as one Councilor, especially in a residential area, I wouldn't really support that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2329.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's just too late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2330.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will, like I said, Mr. President,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2335.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we continue the meeting, then I'll make the motion that I'm still waiting to see if there's a way that we could figure something out with our building department, with our inspectors and our neighbors, to see if we can extend some hours to help you with your business, but at the same time, not affect the quality of life of that neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2432.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2433.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just that I wear a body that really wants to try to support local businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2437.822s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we could find a way, maybe we can talk after the meeting that maybe we could, you know, reach out to a couple of those neighbors and maybe or if you can do some outreach, those neighbors that surround your your<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2452.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the reports that the emails that I received had nothing to do with how hard you work and how much they love your establishment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2459.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The question is, they're just afraid of the outside people or activities that you have no control over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2468.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what they were questioning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2469.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's why I don't wanna deny anything this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2472.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can just, I'd like to motion that we move this to our next meeting, just extend it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2478.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for two weeks and maybe... Given the time frame, I have to open the public hearing and then we can continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2482.304s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can do that, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2483.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I just want to give a petition, just what we're looking to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2486.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So maybe there's a way that we can talk to our neighbors and see if we can find something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2492.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think there's something here that we can work with the neighborhood, but I know what scared everybody was one o'clock and two o'clock every night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2500.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's an old nurse, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3352.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3353.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpello?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3354.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3355.512s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Cohn-Springsteen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3358.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, this is creative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3360.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is raising money to support our housing issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3365.745s">[Scarpelli]</a>: through the people in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3367.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Isn't that great?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3370.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm gonna support this 1000% because this is what we're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3377.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because when we're talking with the last few weeks, last few months, the scary talk has really moved a lot of people in a negative way here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3385.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you hear resolutions like this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3387.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you see what Cambridge has to do for, what Harvard has to do for Cambridge when it comes to housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3395.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You can see what Boston asked for housing with all their universities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3399.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is something that I agree with my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3402.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we need to really, and especially as we see, I mean, they've, Tufts has just grown and growing and growing and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3412.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And all we keep doing is losing revenue, losing tax revenue, providing more services, costing our community more money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3419.045s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I support this wholeheartedly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3420.945s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4925.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To the chair, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4929.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4929.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can have a legal opinion on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4934.353s">[Scarpelli]</a>: backgrounds that have political undertone and making sure that we're following, uh, the process of our rules and regulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4945.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4972.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5420.297s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5422.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First of all, the council president and I did speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5426.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Moving forward, I think that coming to professional opinions that putting in vague resolutions where it comes to discussion, we're going to try to make them more substantive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5439.756s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that whenever we do a subcommittee meeting or a regular meeting and we put resolutions in that are open-ended, I can understand that it's a little confusing, and I think that we can work on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5452.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with this process, I think that understanding, it first started with the process with subcommittee that Councilor Leming proposed that with the newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5465.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that understanding the process where it starts<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5469.574s">[Scarpelli]</a>: here and to a subcommittee and the subcommittee is the process is then sent to the council floor that we vote on something as a council to support or not support or share openly to the public of any concerns that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5484.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Has something changed since then?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5493.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so, and this is so people understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5497.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've gotten phone calls and they said, we don't see your names represented on this newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5504.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the issues I said that, well, I'm not, because I think that I had some concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5509.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the concerns I had was not the fact that we're getting more information out to the community, but making sure that everybody, that there's equity involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5519.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we asked for some answers to the communications director, and he gave us some responses that really didn't equate to much, but still we have still yet vetted how we're getting the have-nots, the people that don't have an avenue to get our information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5538.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And where is our information going?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5540.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it's going to the same people, the haves in our community, and they're getting the information that's designed by six members of this council, that I would question whether there is some violations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5552.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I would ask legal counsel to report back to us if this is in violation of, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5562.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: campaigning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5563.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think because we have six members that are on a slate that are putting out a newsletter that's going directly to an identified group of people that really isn't hitting the whole community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5579.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure, and I appreciate your opinion, but I think there's some issues that I really want a legal opinion on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5588.041s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we should ask that too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5590.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the key is really just asking these questions and having a set of solicitor, this wouldn't even have been a resolution, just a phone call and say, hey, I have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5598.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But because we don't do that, I have to bring this forth on the council floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5602.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I mean, that would be one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5604.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The second, which is more, that's really affected this community more than I think my colleagues even thought they could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5613.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because over this past week,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5616.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: there was communication that was signed by my president and my vice president to state delegates about the transfer tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5628.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's gone rampant that my fellow colleagues used their titles on a topic that we wanted to send to subcommittee that we have yet to talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5646.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The communication, the lack of communication, and the lack of putting forth this process of going towards subcommittee, it's something that we found so important to this community that hundreds of people were involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5658.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the feedback we got back from real people that have been here for years, that actually put this community on the map.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5669.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want you to understand, I get phone calls from people that told me, George,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5673.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if no one's gonna listen to us, and there isn't gonna be the option that Councilor Callahan, they stress, put forth saying, this is just an opportunity to bring this to subcommittee to see what works and what doesn't, to see if we needed, if this is going to, and how we can focus and who we look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5690.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we looking at developers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5691.661s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we looking at homeowners?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5692.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we looking at seniors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5693.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we looking at so on and so forth?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5696.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we didn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5698.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these members of the community legitimately called me, and this isn't a political ploy or anything, I'm just sharing something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5705.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good Medford people, backbone to this community, that said they decided that something what you think is sort of a political victory has now forced them to move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5722.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that to me is damaging to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5726.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's still dividing our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5728.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, don't get me wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5730.609s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody knows this is the political process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5734.272s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Six members of this community, this body, ran on a slate, were elected, and they have the decision in the final vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5743.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody has to understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5744.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if people come up and wanna be angry and disrespectful and talk negatively and be angry, that's too bad, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5752.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They didn't do what they had to do in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5755.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what I want you to understand, that these are real issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5759.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are real issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5760.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is what, it's only a 2% tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5762.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hear that too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5763.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's only this, but we heard it today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5765.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We heard it this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5767.494s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Between the $3 to $6 million focus on getting our roads back to snuff, $3 to $6 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5774.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're talking about a $250 million new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5781.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5782.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're talking about a rent control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5784.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about a 2% transfer tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5789.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're talking about an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5793.048s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're talking about a CPA that the state isn't matching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5798.11s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And from what we see is really, they're not doing their share for affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5805.274s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So with all this, it's not just 2%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5808.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what that letter says, it's pretty damaging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5811.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know if you really thought it out when you signed this on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5816.437s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That'll bring me to the point where I'll ask for, through the clerk, I'll ask for a legal opinion that using city council titles and the correspondence to the state or other entities that gives the impression the information is offered as an official act of the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5833.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It specifically didn't, if you read the letter- Well, if that's something that, I'm cliche for you, but you're not my attorney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5847.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So let me ask the question that we can, Mr. Clerk, through the chair, to ask legal representation if, by using it, no matter what line you put it in, but using your title<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5860.456s">[Scarpelli]</a>: By using your title, does that constitute what I asked?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5865.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if you'd like me to send that to you, I will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5866.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I, Council President, I respect you, but you're not the legal entity of this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5872.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I want that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5875.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wouldn't, if we could, I'd like to make that as a motion that we ask for the legal opinion on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5903.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So city council titles using correspondence to state or other entities, it gives the impression<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5909.929s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that the information is offered as an official act of the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5919.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5920.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5920.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what I'm saying is you whatever line you put it in individually or not,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5927.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's it just doesn't it's it's it doesn't pass the smell test when you sit here and talk to hundreds of people and you express that this is a process that we want to vet it is right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5939.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we put out and what they what was what was said in that letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5944.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: was so damaging that it truly affected neighbors and residents that it's going to affect more than just the 2%, more than what was said, maybe 1% here, 1% there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5957.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The talk was 5%, and who would pay for it, and then so on and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5963.169s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's a magnitude of issues on that letter that I think that as a body to even sign that, individually or not, it just gives out<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5974.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the look that this body truly doesn't want to listen to the residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5978.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want to clarify, what did the letter say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5981.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can read it if you like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5982.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll send you a copy of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6010.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm not done yet, I haven't stopped, I'm still continuing to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6015.507s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, no, I'm not done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6016.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6016.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6017.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the other issue is that we're talking about, you know, the these communities that are involved in this tenure and this in this transfer tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6026.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's surprising to see that these communities and I've reached out to local members of of council and elected bodies in these communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6036.096s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I find it amazing that for the most part, most of these communities that have that have signed on to this are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6043.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: vacation communities, communities that have housing for summer rentals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6049.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have a few that you have conquered, possibly Somerville, Arlington, Cambridge, but then the rest are West Tinsbury, Wellfleet, Truro, Tisbury, Provincetown, Oaks Bluff, Nantucket, Edgartown, Amherst, Boston, Brookline, that's Chatham, Chilmark,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6073.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are towns that, for the most part, when you say that these towns, there are 17 cities and towns that are supporting this, you're sending out the wrong message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6083.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the reason those communities are out there is because of the development that goes on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6088.814s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, if this council truly said, let's focus on a transfer tax on developers for these properties, it'd be important to discuss it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6097.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But with that letter that was just signed on, whether it was two years ago, it was done again this week, that it sends the wrong message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6106.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, and I'll finish with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6110.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you look at what is being asked for and what has been discussed by this council over the last two months, and the monies that you're asking for,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6121.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you're scaring homeowners, homeowners that I think that I don't think you truly understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6127.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A million dollars isn't a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6132.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You raise your eyebrows, but a million dollars for a homeowner in this community isn't isn't a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6138.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And for the people that built these homes to a million dollars, they're hard working blue collar workers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6145.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can you take that off the camera, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6147.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're talking about homeowners that built for nothing and using their homes for retirement for the most part, at least for the 300 phone calls and emails that I've received.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6159.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, again, this is my opinion as a city councilor moving forward when we get it to subcommittees that we really spell things out so we understand the processes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6171.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're not misleading community members that we're going to wait for the subcommittee that was so intense that we haven't had a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6178.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't had a meeting, but then my two fellow leaders, my council leadership here can sign off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6184.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what I think is a violation using the title, but we'll wait for legal opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6190.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6200.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have a lot to say really not from the chair, my friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6214.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You don't say facts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6229.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're not following your rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6854.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6858.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Directly, he used my name, so I would point of personal privilege.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6995.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I thank Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6998.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point taken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7000.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for answering my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7001.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The question I had was the process subcommittee for the newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7006.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It got its number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7007.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was vetted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7009.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It comes to then the body that we vote on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7012.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then once it's agreed with the community, a newsletter is then released, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7017.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7018.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Was the process followed, Councilor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7021.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7023.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is what the conversation was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7025.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And for what I left, I think I've been very vocal in understanding I do the best I can on Wednesday nights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7033.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've expressed that to the president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7035.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I do have another job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7037.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a matter of fact, I have two other jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7039.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I do the best I can to stay to every meet at Council Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7043.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But on Wednesday nights, as Councilor Bears can attest,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7046.437s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I do the best I can to stay as long as I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7050.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to point me out that I left at a certain time, I gave my opinion, and then I had to go close the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7059.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to that point, I've asked the council president to please look for other evenings other than Wednesday nights, so I can stay at all the meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7069.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Also, I don't have to miss a meeting, because I missed one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7072.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I missed the one prior to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7075.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then I stayed as long as I could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7078.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate the discussion that happened after that, but that's common practice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7084.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7085.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've missed meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7086.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've missed meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7087.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've left meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7090.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The process I bring this forward on your situation and your resolution is that what Councilor Callahan said is what is an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7099.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A subcommittee gets a number, we discuss it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7102.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Long as it takes, we make a vote to send this to the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7106.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To the council, we then vote and then we act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7110.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You didn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7114.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You didn't do that, Councilor Bears, through the Chair, to Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7117.353s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You didn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7118.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate that bringing forward, because it's true, that's what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7121.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then to Councilor Collins, through the Chair, to be vague and to be deceiving, not my intention, didn't know how to bring this forward, no different than her first meeting, Councilor Bears, through the Chair, when we talked about, quote unquote,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7142.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The description of our subcommittee was on what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7145.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Home rule petitions, very vague.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7149.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Very vague home rule petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7230.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we talk about these concerns and issues, when we talk about subcommittees, and we talk about subcommittees that are in session that we're not talking about, and they're not being they're not being brought forth yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7244.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When the community sees a concern, and they bring it forth to me, and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7254.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that they're nervous for the fact that the process that they thought was mentioned that evening wasn't followed through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7265.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I looked at this as a process to speak on it so they understood the process as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7273.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So as we move forward with the subcommittee process on the transfer tax, understand what phone calls I got, the emails I got, the people that talked to me on the street,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7284.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7285.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said, what is done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7286.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, it's not done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7288.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, this letter says everything that we fear about, everything that we were nervous about that evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7296.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to one councilor's point of view, as this being dividing and this is being hurtful, you have hundreds of people that felt that night that they weren't listened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7308.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then with the delay and not talking about an issue that was a pretty hot topic,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7314.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and then not being brought forth and then this letter going out publicly, it put people in a different way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7324.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's my responsibility as a council to try to put this forward so we can discuss it, so we can move forward with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7331.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if at any time<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7334.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that you say something to me that's hurtful, and I say something to you that's hurtful, we know each other personally to understand that I know you have a job to do, and you're representing people that have come to you directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7345.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all I'm doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7349.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm telling you, it is scary to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7354.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's scary to people that when I, it's not that it is scary people to the point that they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7360.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what I just, you need to share that as part of this lack of subcommittee process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7365.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, appreciate our talk earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7368.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll make sure moving forward as we move forward with these, our resolutions that I will eliminate discussion and I'll be more detailed for the body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7378.663s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7379.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7704.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's just so wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7706.582s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's semantics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7708.423s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In what way, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7710.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in the way that I just described it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7711.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, it's pretty embarrassing, because for this council, I deserve the respect that when I bring something forward, that it's given back that same respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7720.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to call it that is out of line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7723.671s">[Scarpelli]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8052.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can have that discussion whether it's a letter or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8055.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please, please explain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8057.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's sending a wrong message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8060.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can have a discussion without sending anything to the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8064.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8065.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8567.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8572.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, we have people that want to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8677.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, the question is for the legal department to ask if a newsletter that's being put forth could be construed as campaigning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8685.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the question the first question is legal opinion using City Council titles and correspondence to the state or other entities that give the impression that the information is offered as an official act of the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8709.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the legal standard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8710.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, if I can, I did forward the edification for Council Leming on the 23rd of that evening at 8.23.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8723.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't have your number readily available, Councilor Leming, so I know that Councilor Villes wasn't in-house that evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8730.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I thought I was on the assumption you were, so, because I was also sick, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8737.98s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, what I said was, on that text was, hey, Zach, I'm out if you could just, so you could just move the questions quicker, because I have to leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8748.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's when I asked about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8751.526s">[Scarpelli]</a>: seeing if we can have any meetings outside of Wednesdays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8754.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8852.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8855.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8857.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8882.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Pente, you could speak at public participation, that's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8958.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: where our leadership moving forward, where the mayor stands on this and getting her more involved as we discuss the processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8971.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the process for a home rule petition is this council would discuss it, any issue, then it would be voted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8979.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it's voted through, it would then go to the mayor's office and the mayor would then have the option to veto it or move it through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8986.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then it would go to the state house, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8996.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, is that true?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8997.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the other question was that if it came back to the council,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9001.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we could do vote on overruling her decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9025.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is the process just sort of to be to be informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9028.541s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe I'll explain a little bit better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9030.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So as this process goes on, we start talking about different home petitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9036.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The question also falls in not just in the council, but what the process is with the mayor's office and then with the state delegates and then moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9044.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10854.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what this process is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10856.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The questions that the constituents that reached out to me were with the process, because I believe this council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10874.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There is an issue with affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10878.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it's how we're getting there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10880.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's just a philosophical difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10882.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that our administration has done a terrible job using their responsibilities and their powers to bring affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10893.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think they've done a terrible job over the last five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10896.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Terrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10905.859s">[Scarpelli]</a>: colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10907.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So as the Councilors that want to pay for it, they have to look at what you've got right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=482.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure, Councilor Scrivella.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=485.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=485.651s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You don't care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1454.159s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Kevin, thanks so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1457.661s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1460.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's one of my initiatives when I first started to bring forth the vision of a full-time recreation department, and you've taken that vision that we had years ago and done<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1475.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeoman's work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1476.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's been amazing to see what you've done for not a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1481.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1482.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can honestly say that because I'm reviewing my budget this year, and I'm embarrassed to see what we have and how you're functioning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1491.698s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I give you, you and your team, pat on the back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1495.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You and Mr. Folsom really done a great job, and I think that people should identify that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1500.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One of the constants we've seen in the last few years is how<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1505.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: amazing the recreation department's been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1508.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, we could talk about the little things, but that would have been bigger things in a negative way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1514.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, the lives we've, your life got saved at the pool and the pond and understanding what, how you prepared for that and making sure that we did what we had to do to fund that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1526.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, I didn't hear any, the good part is this, I didn't hear anything negative here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1532.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that you look like you're going to be okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1534.571s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One thing that I did see in one of my initiatives that we met to talk about what we were looking for, I looked at something close to my heart, which is recreation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1545.579s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we have probably the most expensive administrative assistants in the country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1554.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Between your salary and the salary of your assistant, it's kind of...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1562.148s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's kind of we're losing money and what we can be doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1566.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I brought forth the idea that we had when this came about last year with the Elections Commission and talking about the elections office and not having enough work throughout the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1578.922s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and how great would that be to find maybe if the chief of staff can forward this to the mayor's office and look at a part-time position, even if you have someone working in your office, I know because I understand it, someone there at 8.30 in the morning till 12.30, just to prepare your signatures for what you need for payroll, returning emails, returning text, phone calls, that I would imagine would open up so much of your day and so much of your week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1608.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and I could see the benefit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1611.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see a lot in addition to an addition, and it's a minimal addition, especially when we're talking about what we're seeing in the elections office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1619.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And granted, some months might be slower, some years might be slower, but what a way to take the opportunity of, you know, cross-training someone<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1630.29s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to work in that role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1631.77s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I would love to see maybe a little bit more work done before we sign off on the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1638.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And hopefully that can come to fruition because it'll pay off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1644.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's one thing that I fear is that working in recreation, always having someone on the other end of the phone when kids are out at programs,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1654.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or parents have questions, it's imperative that there's someone there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1658.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a safety, it's a reassuring factor, and it's a more legitimate factor, knowing that there's someone that's going to be answering the phone, and it's not going to be your director, your assistant director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1669.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Especially when, like you said, we do the, if<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1672.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to step on your toes, but we do a robust babysitting program, 25 students at $50 a time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1680.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we do it every other every other season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1683.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we're seeing is it pays for itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1687.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Especially if you're already trained to do it, it cuts eliminates the middleman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1691.18s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't really have any other questions except for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1694.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, a pat on your back and for your staff, I think that you guys are doing some amazing things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1699.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hear a track meet, I see middle school programming, I see adult programming, I see drop-in programs, I see week vacation programs, I see programs that other communities don't do that we're doing here, so I give you a lot of credit, and something that I don't think everybody here knows, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1722.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our Director of Recreation is also the leader in the state, the field of recreation and aquatics, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1739.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1739.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So waterfront trainings and stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1741.651s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's another, you know, feather in our cap in the fact that, you know, I was taking advantage of Kevin for a few years calling him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1749.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh helping with my aquatics questions that you know you're always willing to help as a as a brother recreation employee so um I think the other piece too I'd like to I brought this up years ago and uh I'm not sure if it's a violation or an ethics issue but I don't care because I think it's important because I think looking at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1769.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: years ago, I asked for the city to look into making Cornell Stadium's parking lot into a solar parking lot and see the benefits financially, what it can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1778.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I hear that they're talking about maybe the schools coming forward, and that's such a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1784.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But imagine if we could put the fourth cab, if we can look at that parking lot and how we would fund the hockey rink.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1793.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I can only imagine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1794.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would assume the electricity costs would be over almost $200,000 maybe for the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1810.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it just benefits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1812.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then if we use some of that money to bring it back into the recreation department for what you're trying to do, I think that's an added benefit without costing us anything right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1822.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, if we can, for the record, Mr. President, if we can ask, maybe do an energy assessment over at the formal parking lot, and then,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1836.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: again, requests the administration to see if we can do a dual position with another department, which we've heard with the elections department for administrative assistant that would support the recreation department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1850.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you very much and thank you for your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1853.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1859.417s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, overhead, it's pockets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1861.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They can, if you want, the Lincoln Sudbury High School, if they want something to...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1868.035s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to see what it looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1870.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even Stone Zoo has it now too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1871.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it doesn't touch the trees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1874.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It doesn't affect parking spots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1877.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All it does is puts a covering over that we can capture that energy that could feed the hockey rink and save us a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=1884.427s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that would be super if we could see if we can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=2061.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=2076.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The press box has been pretty dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=2078.73s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I guess we've had visitors there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=2081.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Squirrels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=2082.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Squirrels, they have their own, their address there now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=2087.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do we have any talk?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=2089.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that there was some talk that we were supposed to do some renovations, but that hasn't happened, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=2194.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, I know that the only reason why I bring this up is that former alumni that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=2198.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: done very well for themselves, reached out and asked if there's anything they can do financially, or they also are in the business that possibly they would like to commit and help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=2209.563s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if there's any way that if you want to leave that charge and see what that would entail, and I could put everybody together, I think that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=2218.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the other issue too, that they brought up was the audio system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=2223.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I was gonna bring that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=2295.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as we can see, I mean, Homel is now, it's not just the high school's field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=2300.045s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, we're hosting professional teams, our marching band and color guards, we're doing multiple rentals now there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=2309.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think it's beneficial that we, you know, are cost effective, that we make sure we do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=2316.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are they still bringing out that 1902 speaker?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=2320.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: before games you know that gigantic it looked like a megaphone they're not that i know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=2960.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=2961.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=2962.191s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for being here this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=2964.945s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I applaud the eight double plus rating for the bond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=2968.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=2969.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think a lot has to do with the amount of money we have in our free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=2973.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So kudos to the community for investing their money into that part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=2978.911s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's a feather in the city's cap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=2982.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=2984.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just hope it doesn't affect us negatively when we look to balance our budget coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=2990.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: FY 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=2994.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we see the mayor, I think there's a lot of questions I have, especially with the new growth as we're going through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=3001.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: giving understanding, so if you want to prepare for that when we get here, the understanding of the lack of projects that we're seeing, the lack of new tax revenue, and I think the lack of movement in Method Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=3015.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, I believe it was her, at the mayoral debate she talked about these jobs that were already shovels in the ground, I believe I can bring that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=3025.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's going to be important to see where the mayor stands when she gets here, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=3027.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Knowing where that is, especially when we're looking to our fiscal future is going to be very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=3033.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that if we can as well, uh, the home rule petitions that are out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=3036.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't hear much from the mayor and where she stands with those, so it will be nice when she comes as that presentation as we look at our fiscal future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=3045.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it'll be important to see where the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=3053.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm just a little curious that we have, if you can just educate me in the Director of Communications, looks like 94.5, Director of Community Affairs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=3065.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=3066.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, 94.5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=3068.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then we have Special Projects Coordinator, it's a small $13,000, looks like a stipend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=3073.563s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then does that look like we're hiring another communications specialist at 75.3?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=3078.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that what the increase says, is that someone moved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=3108.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=3109.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's funding sources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=3110.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's, that's good to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=3111.945s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just that when you when you look at the budget, and when you're hearing it, I know that I got phone calls today that there are going to be massive cuts in the secretarial staffing at the high school I'm hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=3123.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: huge cuts that that emergency meeting today and I just want to make sure that as we're looking at and I'll say this to all the the department heads moving forward and especially at the school department here with the executive department is making sure that we're looking at our executive offices and making sure that they've tightened their belts as much as they could because it looks like we're losing frontline employees again throughout the city<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=3153.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and we've seen level funded here at this office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=3157.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I could appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=3191.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=3192.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=3194.351s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll be asking for all these commissions of these all method residents managing the staff to the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=3214.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, if I can, I think that if you would have that ready for us with next meeting is the big much meeting, because that's one thing that I look forward to making sure that all of our commissions, our method residents, to have people that live in different communities and sit on commissions that are making big decisions for our community, I think is kind of, you know, it doesn't pass the test to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=3239.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can have that prepared, that'd be appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=3242.268s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=3243.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N-D96vxinG4&t=3286.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I make the motion to refer that to the administration and adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=526.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=528.379s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I've been I've been getting phone calls and people asking that they don't see my name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=532.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I still haven't got my answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=536.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this process as a subcommittee, as you've already moved forward with this, but we still haven't answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=543.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How are we going to get this information to the community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=546.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know there was bantering back and forth about, well, at least getting it started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=550.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it's exactly the message that I didn't want to send that I've been answering questions on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=556.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's who is getting this information?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=558.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not, there's nothing set up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=560.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've still yet to hear anything from the communication director to see how we can get it out to undisturbing communities, parts of a community that's underserved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=569.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How do we get them the messages?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=571.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the truth of the matter is what I'm hearing so far and the understanding of what we're sending out<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=577.575s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is something that our city clerk does at a pretty high level in our meeting minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=584.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just want to make sure that people understand, for the record, I'm not being included in this for a few reasons, and one being that we have still found out, we have still not vetted out the process of where this information is going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=601.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a newsletter to do what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=604.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To go where?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=605.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now again, if it's hitting, if it's, if we put a plan in place to get everybody, especially the underserved in our community, to make sure they're getting the information, because that's who's not getting the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=616.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=618.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want you to know optics are a lot, are pretty big here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=623.274s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if we're bulldozing this with six Councilors and one left on the outside, I want it to be noted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=630.821s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we still have, I put a motion in to ask where these are going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=636.466s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I asked for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=638.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: communication from the communications department that didn't send anything of any substance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=643.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we have still yet to know where we're handing these out because that's all I've heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=648.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to hand them out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=649.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To who?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=651.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To your Lister?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=653.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to your groups?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=655.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, that's that we're using city funds to to send a message out to one organization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=661.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I just think that's wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=662.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just wanted to share my not like it'll go anywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=666.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I just wanted to make sure that I was heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=668.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's on the record that I've stated that if I can Mr. Mr.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=674.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Clerk, that I'm not a part of this process because I don't feel that this process is serving the whole community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=682.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's serving people that can be reached and nothing is being done or designed to reach that underserved part of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=693.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=703.692s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I read the minutes, still no answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=767.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=770.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=772.928s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I appreciate that, but it was discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=776.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=778.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what we're doing is we're putting something out there before we even came to a resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=787.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've come to a resolution, but everything is being discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=790.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what the subcommittees are for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=792.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now we're putting out a product that's actually going out to print.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=796.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we haven't even we at least that's what I'm hearing right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=802.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With everything was being discussed in subcommittee, nothing's gone out to the regular floor, nothing's been voted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=807.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then nothing has been approved to move this this paper to go out to the public and making sure that did we look at we can just we can say that we're serving we're looking into serving the the underserved in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=820.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But just by saying it, just because you check a box doesn't mean we're doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=825.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, my recommendation is let's slow this down and make sure that we get the answers that we want, or else you're gonna leave a group of people in this community, again, feeling like they're not being listened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=837.088s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because there's things that are coming out in the city in the next couple of weeks that is directly showing that this council is saying things but doing something totally different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=848.035s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I, believe me, I don't want to be the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=851.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not, it's usually in the last couple of years, it's never been my nature, but it's right in front of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=858.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's black and white what we're seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=860.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please, to my fellow council, understand, you saying things and just putting them through, that doesn't mean that it was vetted properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=867.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=16.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1029.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Apologize, I switched over to my laptop so I can see the presentation a little bit better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1035.953s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Going back, I know that for transparency's sake, if we could, Council President, can we please make it a motion to ask for the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1046.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Projections of new growth for the last 3 years through the chair through the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1053.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Assessor and the budget director's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1057.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I, you know, that just eliminates any questions that if I come up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1060.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I bring something up and it's something that won't be questioned because it's coming from the department that's supposed to give us that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1068.231s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would really appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1069.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1078.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, please the projections and projections and what we were what we end up getting if we could just for just so we can have an understanding of what we looked at in the past and what we actually had in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1091.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can at least estimate what we're really looking at because 2.5 is pretty pretty dismal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1117.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2899.11s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President to the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2900.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Bob, thank you for giving us this information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2903.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what what what I'm a little, I'm a little nervous about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2907.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we just want to get through and get something on that will work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2910.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we saw it for a minute at the school with the school department with the, you know, the 2.5 million dollars that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2919.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they couldn't find and then they found and then there were a lot of budgets that were frozen and that really put the teachers in some difficult positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2931.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, just curiously on the city side, do we have any departments right now that we're looking to hold positions or cut positions or freeze their budgets for FY24?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2945.929s">[Scarpelli]</a>: um before we can get into 25 because there are rumblings out there that you know there might be some key positions even maybe an overnight position at dpw that we're looking to probably eliminate for the rest of the year and that's these are these are um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2961.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are these are questions that I think we need to know, especially if you're looking at the budget moving forward and seeing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2969.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, having every department trend, just for the sake of numbers in a budget, where do we, where do we look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2977.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In 2024 with our departments on the city side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3003.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3006.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So real quick, it's a simple question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3010.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As our budget director, do we have any departments right now that look like they're in jeopardy of freezing their budget or not having enough for them to finish their FY 24?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3084.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So for clarification through the chair, so we might have some freezes in some departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3090.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I think that when I asked the question, just to move forward as we move forward on this, and I'm hoping that our budget director understands that when we're asking questions that also has to do with the ARPA money, I find it a little befuddling to me that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3106.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our budget director says he doesn't see anything right now, but the chief of staff comes up and says well with our blah blah blah That we there are no there's no Definitives on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3117.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can as we're trying to vet out next year's budget and understanding how we got getting through this budget You know, I think we got the quarterlies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3126.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think today we got one two and three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3128.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I saw them again today I really appreciate that but um, you know, um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3135.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm hearing some trends and some concerns moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3138.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we could just get an update as a form of a motion for our next meeting, Mr. President, that if we do have any departments that are looking at some budget shortfalls in FY24, that we're prepared for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3154.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3211.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So Mr. Mr. President, if I can, this is this is so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3217.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, Bob, if you've taken that, that my comment and anything to be disrespectful to you, please don't think of that at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3225.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm looking at when we're asking questions to our budget director in the past, Bob.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3230.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in the past or in my other roles, when we have a question with the budget director, I would assume that they would have all the information in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3240.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you weren't prepared or worked with the other people that are working on this budget together and you didn't have those numbers, that's not your fault.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3247.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If anybody there took that as an insult, I apologize, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3254.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm just stating the fact, in the past when we've had budget meetings, and we've had other budget directors, and we've had other administrations, or working in other city municipalities and understanding the budget, when you're asking a simple question as, do we feel that any of our departments in the FY24 budget look like it's going to be funded,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3279.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would assume that we would know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3281.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You answered it by saying, well, from what I know, it looks like we're not going to have a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3286.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understood that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3287.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The chief of staff then came up and said, oh, maybe the I believe it was the ARPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3293.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're not we can't be definitive on that because of ARPA money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3296.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I I tend to I tend to really get really disappointed when leaders of our administration<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3305.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: come to that podium and accuse members of this council just because they're asking questions because they haven't been informed at all when it comes to information on the budget and they ask a question that wasn't clarified and then turn it around and make it sound like I insulted someone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3323.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been accused of this over and over again by this person and I find it offensive and that Mr. President and I hope you can take point to that because that is highly highly unprofessional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3334.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4178.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4179.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Two quick questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4180.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One, can we get a copy of this presentation emailed to us, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4186.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I've been held hostage from a virus, so if there's any way that we can get that emailed, I'd appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4196.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And next, just for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4200.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just for us to prepare us, Bob, and I know, like, again, I appreciate your hard work, but when we're doing our projections, our department heads looking at going through an analysis with, let's say, a 10% cut, an 8% cut, a 5% cut in their budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4221.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: just so they're prepared for next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4225.362s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I know that Councilor Beall said I missed, as we're talking to each department head instead of me asking them one by one, I know that Councilor Beall is correct from wrong when I missed the meeting last week that the conversation was that these were pure numbers that department heads gave us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4244.949s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I'd be interested to know if they were given that exercise to prepare us for any sort of cuts moving forward for FY25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4270.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, so but they're given to us as a wish list, correct, Councilman?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4291.331s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, but they weren't asked to do a cut proposal so that we can we can see that to prepare ourselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4298.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4299.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4300.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4302.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5797.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm in agreement with that, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5799.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would move forward with that as a motion, if that's what you need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=98.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that a yes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=113.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=117.187s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Madam Clerk, there was a question, was it last week's meeting, there was a question on a resolution that Councilor Cownie put forth about the registry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=130.719s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not sure it was last week's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=136.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm going to say no, because I want to check that, and then I can get back to you on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=140.11s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We got an email about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=142.231s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was some wording changing for what was originally put into the resolution, and then what was written in the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=512.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Paul, do you want to talk?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=642.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=644.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate bringing this forward to Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=647.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let him indulge me with this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=650.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I spoke to Mr. Stone King, supervisor who has now moved on to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=660.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: new community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=662.191s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he passed along a letter that he asked if I, you know, could read he shared it with everybody here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=670.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But for this is reading for Mr. Stone King says, dear Mayor Brianna Longo Cone, I'm writing to formally resign from the position as superintendent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=736.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, can we have the therapy dog back in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=738.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Round two?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=738.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can we have round two of the therapy dog, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=755.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=756.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, so I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=758.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He writes, I'm writing to formally resign from my position as Superintendent of Water and Sewer for the City of Medford effective April 5th, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=766.436s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It is with heavy heart that I submit resignation as I've greatly appreciated the opportunities and experience I've gained in my time serving the City of Medford during my tenure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=776.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have had the privilege of working under the leadership of DPW Commissioner Tim McGiven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=780.582s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I must commend Commissioner McGiven for his professionalism, dedication, and unwavering commitment to the betterment of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=787.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: His leadership has been a source of inspiration and guidance to me, and I am truly grateful for the support and mentorship he has provided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=794.233s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will strive to emulate his exemption leadership as I move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=799.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Despite the admirable qualities Commissioner McGiven have found myself increasingly frustrated with the administration's lack of action addressing critical issues within the department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=807.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The recent handling supervisor of water and sewer job posting, coupled with the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=814.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And something offers 0% costs of living increase for FY 24 has underscored and concerning absence of values you place in my position as well as the lack of priority place in the central matters, such as water main replacements, aging utility infrastructure staffing shortages and overall neglect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=832.739s">[Scarpelli]</a>: of the needs of the DPW.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=834.159s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have worked tirelessly to address compliances issues, modernize departmental operations to highlight the pressing concerns surrounding the water distribution system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=844.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Regrettably, my pleas for assistance recognition of regulatory concerns and urgent calls for action seemingly fallen on deaf ears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=854.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It is disheartening to feel ignored and undervalued in the position where the welfare of the community is at stake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=859.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe that my efforts have made this positive impact, but there is still so much work to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=866.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have reached a point where I feel I have exhausted all avenues and effected meaningless change within the covered environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=872.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It is essential that the City refocuses its attention on critical infrastructure projects, staffing needs, and operational improvements to ensure the continued well-being of Medford and its residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=883.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm deeply concerned the residents are unaware of the alarming conditions of the water system and its critical need for substantial improvement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=891.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Immediate focus and drastic change are essential to ensure the integrity of Medford water infrastructure<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=898.466s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as time is running out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=899.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm grateful for the opportunity to have served the city of Medford and valuable lessons I've learned along the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=905.51s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I extend my deepest appreciation to all those who have supported and collaborated with me during my time here as those contributions have been instrumental in shaping my professional growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=914.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wish the city of residence the best in the future and hope necessary steps will be taken to address the challenging challenges facing DPW.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=922.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you once again the opportunity to have been part of this community<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=926.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sincerely, Dan Stone King.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=929.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. Stone King.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=932.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had an opportunity to talk to Mr. Stone King and I had a great conversation with Tim McGibbon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=939.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I find appalling and what's frightening is that whenever lately, I don't know if we've followed along with my resolutions, we've always had something come back from the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=951.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you guys notice that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=952.571s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Every day after I bring something up, like even tonight, we have something about the water department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=957.796s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why does it take?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=959.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why does it take a negative resolution to make city administration move on something this important?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=965.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Stone King actually told me, we're not there yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=969.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But he says he wants us to think in Medford as Flint, Michigan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=973.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now we know how bad Flint, Michigan is right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=975.827s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now I said, Is it that bad?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=977.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I talked to Tim, he says we're getting there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=980.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was very excited when ARPA came out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=984.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the first phase of ARPA was meant for what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=988.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Infrastructure needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=990.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they had a plan in place to really start moving things along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=994.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What he told me is that we're moving at a pace of about, what is it, a quarter or half a mile?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=998.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need three miles a year to catch up in Medford for what the aging infrastructure that we have in our water department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1005.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I found amazing to me is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1007.824s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know if people realize this, his position holds a license that you have to have to run the water department in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1015.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you don't have the certain license, you're at serious risk of serious danger when it comes to your water quality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1024.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So he's there having that license, which aren't many people that have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1028.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a matter of fact,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1030.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we speak right now, I believe Medford has hired Weston and Sampson, an outside agency, another outside company, paying them $200 an hour, an hour to sit in that office just to make sure that we have someone in place to qualify that our water is safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1048.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, all this had to be done is a conversation and fair negotiation process to say, hey, what do we need to keep you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1055.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I talked more about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1056.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It wasn't about the money system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1058.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was about the value.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1060.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was in the position for two years, two years of vital, vital position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1065.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So do you know how many times he spoke to the mayor twice?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1068.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Twice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1073.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we could say whatever we want and what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1077.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And like I said, I'm gonna say it again, because there's a bunch of issues that I'll bring up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1080.474s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want everybody to follow this along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1081.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because as I bring things up, all of a sudden we have resolutions from the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1086.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's funny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1088.636s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But these are all too late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1091.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not for Weston and Sampson, they're making a killing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1093.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $1,600 for today, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1094.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Eight hour days, $200 a day, $1,600 a day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1100.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, I'm gonna be honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1102.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've reached out to neighboring communities, asked them about this person with this license.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1106.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've reached out to representatives MWRA that I know, from Medford, that hold that license.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1113.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Quote unquote, A, I would never come to Medford because the administration's a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1120.293s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And B, why would they leave?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1121.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're making way more money where they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1125.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is the problem that we're having.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1127.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if you're watching, every week, it keeps piling on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1131.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1133.164s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a lack of leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1135.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So Mr. Stonekin wanted to send that along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1137.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know I had a great discussion with Tim McGibbon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1140.963s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Tim did send over a letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1143.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody received the letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1145.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I shared that with Mr. Stoneking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1148.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, well, he said, in typical fashion, nothing against Tim McGibbon and the DPW, because he works for the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1156.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But all this does is just delay everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1160.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What do they say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1160.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're starting the process now to start looking into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1163.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they've been working on it for a couple of weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1166.048s">[Scarpelli]</a>: His words were, quote unquote, it's just talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1169.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what he's felt for two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1171.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's just talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1172.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate Tim.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1173.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Listen, I know it's not Tim McGibbon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1175.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I talked to Tim.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1176.77s">[Scarpelli]</a>: His hands are tied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1178.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had a great discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1179.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I understand his frustration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1183.231s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we are where we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1186.539s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I thought I'd share another happy Medford story with everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1191.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that council bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1193.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that he sent you have some administration, they sent some some messages to the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1200.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you have that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1201.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you want me to read it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1202.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can read it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1202.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1203.016s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1571.165s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate Director McGiven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1575.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But to my fellow councillors, is this not a theme that we see?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1584.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: City Hall needs to be done, we're gonna set up a committee, we're gonna look at development, we're gonna set a consultant, we're gonna look into things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1594.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything is, just like Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1598.316s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Stoneking said to me, it's all talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1601.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a director of DPW speaking for his boss, who's over and over again shown that nothing's getting done, zero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1611.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not getting anything done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1614.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talk about multi-million dollar issues, that we had it right in our hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1618.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had millions of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1620.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When ARPA came out, that we could still use for infrastructure needs, that we did nothing, zero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1628.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1630.609s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Stonekirk writes this letter, I put it on as a resolution, what happens?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1635.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The position that hasn't gotten any movement for months comes to us tonight for a change in CAF so we can raise it, so we can get better, we can entice people to come out now, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1647.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is exactly what we're seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1651.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What's that saying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1651.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a dog wagging its tail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1655.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What's that state?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1656.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The tail wagging its dog.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1657.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Tail wagging its dog, exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1658.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is what I feel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1661.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Honestly, sometimes it's like watching a dog chase its tail with this administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1667.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we've known since the mayor's been in 2020 that we've had a huge issue here and that it was compiling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1675.041s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But now all of a sudden,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1677.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in her 50 years, we're gonna now go into this, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1683.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wish you put together a pilot program or a committee like she did with the finance, with the water department that April as well, and maybe we can get something going, but we still have seen nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1693.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're still seeing nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1694.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This still doesn't do us any, it doesn't do anybody any good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1698.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I appreciate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1701.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The answer, but it just only leads to the same old lack of leadership and the same old destructing, destroyed Medford that has nothing moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1713.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2696.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3364.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, if I can, Judge Kavanaugh, if you can, if you honor me just for a moment, it takes a great man to know a great man.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3384.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that it's important that Medford knows that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3397.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, talk about a legend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3404.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's uh Judge Kavanaugh is is uh someone we should all be proud of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3409.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, sometimes what he just said, sometimes I get offended now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3414.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Some of my behavior sometimes when you have honorable people like that approach the bench and um I remember as a young man,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3428.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to speak on behalf of another great man.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3432.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're losing our heroes, and the gentleman who's leaving the chamber right now is one of those people, so we should give him what he deserves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3440.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3813.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I think that there's a dialogue that's being that's that's created now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3818.477s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I hope everybody's really watching and listening because we're hearing a lot lately about lack of funding, lack of management, saying it's not mismanagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3829.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what we're seeing in what the dialogue that I'm trying to show everyone is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3838.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have rules in this council that any awards over $5,000 have to be approved by this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3845.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know of many, multiple, multiple hundreds of thousands of settlements that have been put out there that I've talked to different representatives that we know nothing about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3856.297s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So anytime we have these issues and we have these issues that come up and questions that come up,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3864.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It seems like they're hidden agendas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3867.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've been asking, for instance, what we paid KP Law since they've been here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3872.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now we voted on what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3874.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $5,000 for a retainer so they can be on staff for the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3879.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, now that's blown up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3880.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now we don't know what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3881.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that if it goes by the trend of December, which is close to $80,000 for the month of December, that's pretty frightening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3890.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's not including other things we know nothing about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3893.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I bring this up to ask the mayor, especially before the budget season and before my colleagues asked him that what we're seeing a trend of possibly asking for taxpayers to be penalized for the lack of mismanagement and what we're seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3908.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I say lack of mismanagement, we see a mayor speaking for years at debates talking about new growth and development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3919.494s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At the debate with Councilor Caraviello, she spoke and saying that we have three projects ready to go that raise millions of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3926.779s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those projects are gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3927.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why I asked, I asked for the Office of Community Development to come out because we had 40B jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3934.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Remember we talked about the mismanagement of the 40B jobs and losing over 600 housing units for affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3942.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3943.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We lost millions and millions and millions of dollars for fees, fines and new taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3948.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's called new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3949.827s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't had that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3951.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had the mayor talk about Method Square, starting Method Square, shovels in the ground, bringing millions of dollars of revenue, nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3959.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've seen nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3961.621s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when I say mismanagement, it's mismanagement of understanding of where we're going in the direction we're going in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3970.311s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can say we didn't fund anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3972.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can say that we're putting money into the general account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3975.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the reason why we have to put in general account is because our management<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3979.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: isn't following through with the promises that they've made of transparency and follow through for new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3986.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't seen any of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3987.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why we're going to general fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3989.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why the money that was earmarked for one thing has to go to another thing, because we're losing that money because we're not the mismanagement of our finances in the city hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3999.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm gonna give you some examples that I want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4001.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm asking the mayor for a report, meeting executive sessions, not to know anybody's names, but to understand that, where is this going?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4012.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're looking for mismanagement of finance for City of Method.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4015.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would like to see the dismissals of city staff, and then the lawsuits filed by that city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4023.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The cost of investigating<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4027.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: these city staff members, the cost for hiring private investigators, this I'm even hearing, and this is what the problem is when you have lack of transparency and lack of openness, central administration, that I believe the firefighters were told to be careful because people are watching them now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4046.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is this is what happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4048.661s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what happens because it's been done before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4051.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a city, there's a DPW employee that was followed for months, months by a private investigator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4058.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was let go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4060.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's right now in active, it's in an active process right now, but they've already told him, the courts have already ruled, there was nothing wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4070.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We wasted thousands and thousands of dollars on investigators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4074.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're looking at the cost of legal representation for all these cases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4079.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Forget about the 40 B cases that you know, they could have won.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4083.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's an automatic, you can't fight a 40 B and lose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4086.922s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All you can do is string it along a long enough time so the developers can back out because they're losing so much in funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4095.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, that's what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4097.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One project we had,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4102.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A development company went bankrupt after four years, they're gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4106.11s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The 40B projects, they waited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4108.351s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know the world's the gold gym site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4111.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The owner spent over $12 million to keep that going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4114.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, the investors in that job had done what now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4116.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've said, you know what, enough is enough, we're moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4119.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The project on Boston Ave that I believe they're talking about possibly putting in a mosque now, five acres putting to a mosque, lack of taxpayer money, lack of new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4130.953s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Think about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4132.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Understand the mismanagement and what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4135.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's where where's the money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4136.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why is there money there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4138.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why are we looking now to look at a pretty pretty outrageous and intense movements to try to bring new money in through the tax payers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4148.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can't do that until we see where the mismanagement is coming at City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4153.913s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We see the city, the staffing that has to be paid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4157.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would ask for the record that the mayor please<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4162.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: inform us the cost of any consultants or per diem staff that she has in place right now, she has in the last few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4170.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I say, let's say four years since you've been in office, and what we're paying out the staff that she hasn't filled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4176.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's not because it's not because people are leaving because they want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4184.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're being pushed out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4186.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're talking about good people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4188.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't even heard the case haven't heard about about Aleesha Nunley, the best finance director in the Commonwealth, I would say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4196.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mike Durham, the best veterans affairs director that method has ever seen the state has ever seen gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4205.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're talking about settlements that I know that we know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4207.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you did you know the custodians settled on their their legal issues that they were they were given back $500,000 that the city reimbursed them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4217.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They were rewarded that did we vote on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4220.839s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4222.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the cost of settlements, the cities in the schools, I want to know what that what those numbers are not the people, but what the numbers are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4232.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the cost of the law firms because I know it's just not KP law, you can see that when we say KP law, everybody picks on them, because they're in front of us every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4241.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4243.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have multiple, multiple law offices that are working for the city of Medford, multiple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4250.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it hurts me because I see new Councilors giving reports that they met with KP Law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4258.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's funny because some of our Councilors, Justin and I laughed the other day when Matt talked about, Councilor Leming talked about he met with KP Law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4267.839s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was never given, no one's ever told me we could talk to KP Law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4271.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I would love to know what that costs, because an in-house city solicitor is part of their salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4278.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It makes it so easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4280.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we look at this resolution, this is really to get a report before the budget comes out, before we look at some drastic changes, because I don't know if people heard, but I believe the school department has $7.5 million to get leveled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4296.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that what we're hearing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4297.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 7.5 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4301.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, now I'm going to guarantee you everybody, the rainy day account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4306.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why does somebody want to bring the rainy day account in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4309.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's got to put the money from somewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4311.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So she wants to take it from free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4313.532s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm going to let everybody know this is what it is because I've been here a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4316.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's going to go to free cash, call it a rainy day account and pull out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4320.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it truly $7.5 million?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4322.177s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4324.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody nervous about that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4325.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4326.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4326.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a scary number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4328.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's still going to be a scary number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4331.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the mismanagement of this city, the mismanagement of the school department, the mismanagement of the finances and that office in this city has been devastating to this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4342.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not only lack of new growth, but also in fraudulent and misleading and legal fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4356.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, we don't know what they are, we can only speculate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4359.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why I asked the mayor to bring us a report in the executive session so my fellow councils can look at this when it comes down to understanding some of the comments that my fellow councils have made in the past about looking at different funding mechanisms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4376.423s">[Scarpelli]</a>: going back to the taxpayers and saying, hey, we need we need X amount of money $250 million for new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4383.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe it was I've talked to new school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4386.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we have some people in the audience right now that worked on this new school projects before I've talked to people in Somerville just did a new school people in Arlington to think in this climate of $7.5 million in the hole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4399.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that the school committee is going to come to us and ask us for $2.5 million so they can start the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4405.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we don't even know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4406.73s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it starts at 30% reimbursement of a new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4413.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't even know what it's going to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4415.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the feasibility study $2.5 million when we don't even know if we're going to come close to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4421.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And from what I'm gathering from my friends that I have in the state, it's not very positive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4426.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the reason why I bring this up in this, this is, this is hopefully we can go to do I think it's going to happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4432.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Probably not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4433.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're never going to see this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4434.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the hope is to go on executive session with the administration<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4437.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with her legal team, with the HR director, with the chief of staff with the mayor with us sit there and say, Okay, this is what we spent the last four years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4446.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are lawsuits that are pending, because I know there are lawsuits out there right now that they're trying to settle out of court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4453.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4454.821s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's hundreds of 1000s of millions of dollars out there that still have to be spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4460.105s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And in the meantime, we have nothing new going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4463.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, I take it back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4465.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a music venue going on in Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4468.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, Mystic Ave, we're supposed to change the zoning, the gateway community is gonna come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4474.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What's the talk now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4475.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have one building being talked about, one building and nothing else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4482.695s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I ask again, my fellow councilors, as we go through this process of looking to where the needs are in our city, we all know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4491.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're fiscally strapped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4492.11s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We all know we're in crisis financially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4496.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And possibly, if it came down and we could sit together with the administration and they can show us, they can show me that, you know what, George, this is the data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4508.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, you're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4509.963s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't lose millions of dollars in new tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4512.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't lose millions of dollars in new fees and fees in permitting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4517.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4518.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't lose millions of dollars on on settlements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4521.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't lose millions of dollars on on legal services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4526.719s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If they can show me that I will be the first one to vote yes on anything that you ask for an increase in taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4533.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But until they can show us<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4536.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that they're not mismanaging our funds, because this is what we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4540.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The city council, we're in charge with a fiscal stewards of our our city's finances, with the last line of defense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4547.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So unless we can prove that they can prove that all we'll be doing moving forward, and any sort of tax, any sort of override any sort of debt exclusion, it's putting more money into a hole that'll disappear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4561.544s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4564.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we're all smart enough to understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4565.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is why I bring this resolution up, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4568.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I ask the mayor to please bring this forward, that she meets with us in executive session to give us a breakdown, to prove me wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4576.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope she can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4578.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Come prove me wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4579.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Tell me we're not spending millions and millions of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4584.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we could see a way that we can find a way to fund the city the way it needs to be funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4589.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But until then, these are huge questions that they need to answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4593.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is mismanagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4596.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't hundreds of years of neglect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4599.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is mismanagement from someone that's been in office now for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4603.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's done nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4605.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When neighborhood communities were in the same spot we were,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4609.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: talk to the mayor in Malden, talk to the mayor in Somerville, talk to the mayor in Everett.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4614.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They had the same issues we had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4616.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They used those funds to make sure they did what was right for their community first, before she started covering general accounts because she mismanaged the business of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4628.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's done a terrible job in the city bringing finances in the system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4633.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Remember, the last meeting we had was new growth was what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4636.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: our new growth that we talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4637.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know Councilor Bears says that the city assessor is going to give us a great report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4641.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can't wait to see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4643.164s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But here we are, year five now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4646.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Year five, she's the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4648.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The most we've seen that was presented to us was a million dollars, new growth from fees and fines from traffic and parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4657.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was amazing to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4660.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was amazing to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4661.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I asked for this report, because I don't know, I'm sure you're all smart enough that you see what I'm trying to do here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4667.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm trying to show my colleagues that listen, I understand what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4671.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you we need we need the finances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4674.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But understanding taxation isn't always the best resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4678.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First, let's find out what's causing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4681.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why aren't we bringing in new money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4683.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why are we spending so much money on things we shouldn't be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4687.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then if we shows that that's not true at all, Councilor Scarpelli, then I walk away in peace voting for whatever the city needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4696.231s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But right now, this right now shows poor, poor mismanagement of the finances of this community and the leadership of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4704.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=5406.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: through the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=5407.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are you referring to the chair?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=5590.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First, this was reached out by a few neighbors and they didn't realize, and I explained to them that Council President and a few of other my colleagues have been working tirelessly on this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=5601.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I went out to visit and talk with them, you can blatantly smell the creosote that is, I can't see how it's not harmful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=5611.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that you've done your due diligence, Council President, I really appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=5615.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know how hard you work with the MBTA, our state delegation to make sure something moves on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=5620.714s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm just gonna step away and just give you the kudos you deserve because you've worked tirelessly on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=5628.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, we're seeing the true ignorance of our MBTA work its magic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=5632.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6163.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A few piles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6167.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, it's hundreds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6169.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know I live across the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6173.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6173.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're trying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6174.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want everybody to know the reach out to myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6176.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6176.609s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, the council bears in this in and of itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6180.051s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6180.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6180.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Staying right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6181.913s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's scary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6286.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6287.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that there are a few representatives from the fire department here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6292.574s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm again when we're talking about mismanagement of city funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6297.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The reason why I brought this up is during the school committee meeting when they were talking about the you know what the devastating news in that financial front was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6307.407s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then I believe there was some conversation about possible layoffs and we talked about, you know, we're talking about, you know, police, fire teachers, most important people in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6319.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6321.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then the mayor sent this email saying that they were bringing in, I believe it's municipal solutions that were coming in, and they were going to, at a startup cost to start, almost $10,000 to bring this organization in to do a study of procedures and policies that were 60 years old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6341.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I emailed the mayor, I expressed my displeasure again of wasting taxpayers' money because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6349.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In the normal situation, and I've talked to police officers, I've talked to directors and assistant superintendents, I've talked to other department leaders in our community, in our city structure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6364.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when they're making fundamental policy changes and procedures, it starts with the people we already pay, the professionals that are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6372.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They work on those policies, and then they review it together with the administration, making sure it falls in all the criteria that's needed, and they make those necessary changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6382.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I bring up 60 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6385.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the mayor responded, said, if you have any questions, contact Chief Evans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6389.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Chief Evans picked up the phone right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6391.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I really appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6392.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had a great conversation, and I respect Chief Evans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6396.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know the difficulties in, and we had a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6400.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had an agreed to disagree moment because he said, George, I'm trying to do a lot here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6406.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we do have some policies that are 60 years old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6410.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I can't do everything at once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6412.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, Chief, first of all, in the normal situation, would you have done this with your team?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6420.92s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He said he's inundated because he started this position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6424.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So simple question is this chief,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6427.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it's 60 years old, if there truly is policies and procedures that are 60 years old there, you can't wait another six months?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6438.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to save the city taxpayers money, especially when you're talking about possibly laying off firefighters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6445.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I did hear some great news that I'll also ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6449.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll ask our our friends from the fire department that I hopefully they give us some good news tonight because I heard some things about this possible grant that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6460.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: would absolutely save our community and I'm actually giddy about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6463.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6465.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That'll be that'll be something that I'm going to add on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6467.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But right now, I know that today,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6471.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: today, municipal solutions were on site meeting with I believe the deputy chiefs and starting the process already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6480.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know what the final number is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6482.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It could be 50,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6482.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It could be the cost of another firefighter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6485.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know because what we did get we got a start of almost 10,000 the beginning of a study again, another year, I'm going to say it because we don't normally do this in our community and other departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6501.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When it's in the police, with the police department, they start the process with the police department and their leadership team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6509.368s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When it's in the school department, they start with their direct as a curriculum, they work it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6514.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then if they need more clarity and more backing, then they go out to an organization and bring someone to tie that in together for maybe a minimum amount of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6524.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're seeing right now, shockingly, the fire department, the firefighters aren't even being looked at to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6533.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People that we've trusted, all of a sudden now, everything is under a microscope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6538.855s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now the mayor is bringing in municipal solutions to meet with the fire department to look at how to make these six-year-old changes and change the policies and procedures in their association, which I don't disagree with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6554.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but to spend, again, mismanagement financial funding in this community is just waving its ugly face again at wasting money again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6565.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that you're on the forefront, Mr. Jones, and you guys have been, so if you have anything to add, I know that I wanna know how that was going, if you can, what's the practice usually with the fire department, with past chiefs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6581.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6583.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, no, that's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6584.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That hasn't passed yet, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6817.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now the six if I can, Mr. President, yes, the 60 year old policies that they're talking about is it's I know we have six year old policies here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6825.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like, for instance, we don't I'm milking cows can't roam free.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6830.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that the type of stuff that we're seeing in these policies that they're just useless policies that they're old, but they're still there that we just need to take out what some of the Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6864.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Financial mismanagement, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6867.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or retaliation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6868.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6868.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's one or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6870.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It seems like every week the firefighters are here and we're bringing up something that the mayor is keeps piling on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6878.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm a little disappointed with that, but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6880.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm sorry to interrupt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6946.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I know that it's time of the year right now that the firefighters can apply for a grant that they would, I don't know what the agency is, FEMA, that FEMA would allow the city<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6961.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to incorporate a grant for as many members to get you to even to where your staff needs to be, and they would pick up the total cost, correct me if I'm wrong, for three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6974.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6975.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This will make our firefighters whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6977.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we don't have to wait, we don't have to use a penny of this, this community's funding to make that happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6984.264s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I heard I heard that I was so excited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6986.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I just I, you know, it's something it's good that we're hearing some good news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=6990.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can you give us an update with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=7047.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that would mean with overtime, what would that do to be fully staffed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=7054.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Think about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=7159.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if I can't through the chair, I'm a little confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=7163.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So where we put in- We put in for 11.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=7205.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we're not asking for the 15, we're asking for 11.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=7208.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So those four can avoid us from getting this grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=7297.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My last question, if you can, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=7299.436s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=7299.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that would mean that the fight, my hope would be that the fight upon will be exempt for any cuts then, because they would have to maintain that number, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=7334.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's good to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=7335.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, we've heard so many negative things in the last, it's good to hear something positive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=7340.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know, Danielle, you've been instrumental with being the union secretary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=7346.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that you've been the busiest person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=7347.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that Bobby and Eddie want to say that they are, but I appreciate all your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=7353.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because, because what we're doing with this is we're actually finding alternative ways to fund our firefighters and our fire department for the safety of our community and creative ways and not coming out of the tax base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=7366.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But so I applaud you guys that that was such that's great news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=7370.579s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=7396.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is our staff doing all this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=7399.142s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're paying someone over $10,000 to see what's right for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=7402.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just just throwing it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=7403.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=7464.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: See what else you can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=7917.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8088.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if I can, Mr. President, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8089.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8090.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8091.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is what I was trying to get to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8094.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, because I want to make this as a motion, if it's true, especially coming to budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8099.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So our chances, if we went to those other four firefighters and we went full board with this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8107.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because this is what I was told, is that we would have a substantially better opportunity by doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8116.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8116.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so in a form of a motion, I'd like to ask the mayor, why wouldn't we look at four more firefighters to make us whole?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8124.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can do that, Mr. President, because as we get into the budget season, and we lose a huge opportunity because we didn't go all the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8131.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We went with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8134.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We went with what 11 we said, and we needed 15 to make get us to that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8139.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we would eliminate all that money for overtime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8143.071s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We would we would have it paid for for three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8147.293s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, I thought that's what I thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8150.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's why I'm a little perplexed right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8244.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So through the chair, as a council, if we can have our president send a message to the mayor, can we adjust those numbers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8252.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, it's too late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8586.311s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Danielle Masolino, you should be credited for what you're doing and put on a pedestal because this is exactly what, no matter what the junk you guys have been dealing with, no matter how angry everybody's getting, you're sitting down at a desk and doing real work to make a difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8601.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And sometimes I feel like I sit here and I yell and we get mad at each other and then you go home and you say, what did I just accomplish?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8610.076s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't do anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8611.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I want to make sure that I acknowledge for one, I know I feel that my Councilors feel the same thing that you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8619.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they're doing what we should all be doing, and that's putting your nose down and going to work and getting it done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8624.661s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I just hope that in the end, we're sitting here and we name the new Marcelino Fire Station after you, because the whole staff is going to be staffed by your grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8637.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's my hope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8637.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8638.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She was hired on the same program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8642.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, wow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8643.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8643.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8644.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, again, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8645.794s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The chief didn't want to put in for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8648.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8650.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8685.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is there a motion to send the question to the mayor, if I can, on the reasoning for that, why we didn't move forward with those four other firefighters to give us a better opportunity to achieve this FEMA grant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8774.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The I just wanted to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8785.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're hearing some issues with the Crystal Campbell fountain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8788.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that there have been some movement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8792.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I guess they tested the computer to get the fountain moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8797.507s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're hoping to get it going for yesterday's marathon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8800.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, it didn't it didn't come to fruition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8804.671s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There is talking to Mr. McGiven talking to former Councilors, there is a concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8810.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I hope to be a mediation immediate for that for this process that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8815.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When Mayor McGlynn did the fundraising for the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden, he made sure that no matter what his existence would be in Medford, he would leave it into a trust with an organization that would oversee the funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8831.584s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because I think the fear was it would raise all this money, and then when the city needed in bad times, it will be forgotten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8839.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there's some confusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8841.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've talked to Mr. McGiven that there was words that, there was word going back and forth that the reason why they couldn't do it is because they weren't releasing the funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8850.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I talked to former Councilors that said the funding would have been released, but they wanted more of a detailed itemized breakdown for what that funding is, because that's what the trust asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8860.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, and unfortunately, that didn't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8862.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I believe the city move forward to make the changes needed to fix it on their own.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8869.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The other piece of that is what people are really upset about when you've been around, you saw the original garden with the fountain on the lights on, and then all of the sunflowers and crystals name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8882.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She loves sunflowers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8884.304s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and they planted flowers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8885.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, it was an amazing area and it was so peaceful and a lot of people really took ownership of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8892.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's been some, there's something going on between the people running the trust and the relationship with the mayor and trying to have trust there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8902.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I talked to Mr. McGiven to reach out that if they want me or any of the council to be involved to try to mediate this, to try to make sure that ultimately the trust is there to fix the garden and keep the garden, the planting of the plants funded through the trust and the city also understanding that just do your due diligence, presents what they're asking for if it's three quotes,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8930.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they know what they're paying for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8932.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So legally, they can lease that money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8934.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's what that's where we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8936.763s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we are close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8938.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I did talk to a few dbw members that were there when they were testing the computer for the fountain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8944.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8945.911s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we're still a ways away before seeing what that garden deserves to be with the lights, the fountain, the colorful water that changes colors, and then the garden that goes around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8957.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8958.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for your time, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8962.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would ask for meeting with Mr. McGiven, myself in the trust, or anybody else in the council would like to join us to try to find a resolution to do what this trust was intended to do, and that's keep the garden in Crystal's honor, because we can't forget that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8982.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She was a special person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8984.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Her family was great people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8986.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My wife ran the Boston Marathon for five years in her name with her friends from UMass Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8994.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that garden did mean a lot to their family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=8998.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In the worst time of their lives, the city of Medford gave them something that they could always go to and feel that crystal spirit was still there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9006.417s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's gotta be something done and we have to figure it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9009.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's figure that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9011.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9044.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's what we're asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9046.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're asking for a sit down with it, whether it's mediation, where we're setting, because I think there's a lack of trust on the trust side because of the lack of support from central administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9058.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not Tim, I think Tim's doing the best he can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9061.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think maybe another elective fit body that comes into place says, hey, let's support this trust and make sure the funding and the processes used the way it was intended to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9073.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think, like I said, I think Mayor McGlynn did this for the sole purpose of the money not disappearing and being used somewhere else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9079.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And people forget that people actually donated thousands of dollars to go directly to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9084.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, and it's important to see that last year was the 10th year anniversary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9090.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that family members and friends from UMass and the running team, they really wanted to be here to do the celebration to kick off the marathon, and they couldn't do it last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9099.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it was super disappointing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9102.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and there's a lot of people put a lot of hard work to make sure that happened in a short period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9107.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you remember,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9108.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, at the time, as soon as this happened, me and McGlynn really started moving quickly and getting funding for, you know, third parties to come in and donate a lot of money to make this happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9118.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9121.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9122.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Tell her say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9385.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In my discussions with everyone, the trust is in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9389.579s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a person in charge of the trust that is in charge of all the money, that has criteria set in place that when the funding needs to be addressed for the planting of the flowers, any upkeep of the fountain, that the city who's in charge of the site<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9407.293s">[Scarpelli]</a>: presents the trust with a breakdown, a financial breakdown, that's reasonable to what the trust rules were, so they can then cut them the check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9419.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The problem is, I think there's, I think the person you gotta talk to is go across the hall, talk to the mayor's office, and ask what their role is with this, Mr. Castagnetti.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9430.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm gonna give you 30 more seconds, but if you can,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9434.574s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that that's what I was told.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9436.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So working with Mr. McGiven, he's been working his tail off on his own trying to find funding and city funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9443.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are funds though there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9445.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm hoping that we can get I'm not going to stop until this is done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9449.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I now that I've been invested in it, I'm hoping to meet with the trust and sit down with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9454.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that Councilor Caraviello has worked his tail off<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9458.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, probably he has to try to make this happen, but for some reason, you know, you have money there and you have people that are willing to spend it, but it has to be spent in a certain way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9468.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's some non-transparent people, I should say, that maybe don't want to go that route.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9473.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but that's the issue right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9474.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's putting people in a room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9476.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if it's me and Tim and the trust people and saying, okay, how do we make this work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9480.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Bring in, you know, a mediator to say, how do we make this work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9484.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because ultimately,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9486.579s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they don't want to release the funds because this is their funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9489.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is the rules that they were entrusted with when they were given control of these funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9494.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So and I can't blame them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9496.065s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is this is what they signed on for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9498.827s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm hoping to get it done, Mr. Kessler.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9501.268s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I promise I want it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9502.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want it done myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9813.368s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was informed by the union representatives representation that I don't know if we without legal representation here to guide us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9825.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: position is an arbitration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9827.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's being heard in arbitration because the position was a union position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9833.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's posted as a non union position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9836.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't as much as I wanted, and I was going to follow up with, you know, also asking for an increase in the calf, if this is where we're doing it for the city solicitor, so we can get to a rate that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9849.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it's going to be appealing for someone because it's obviously not working and this is the mayor controlling the dialogue everyone again so she sees the need here but as city solicitor she controls the dialogue kp law so she's not going to raise the cap we we did request that as part of the budget right no i i know that was the mayor replied to me in an email that she will get us a paper to increase that cap<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9871.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, I know, but what I'm saying is we asked for that, we still haven't seen it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9874.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is an issue with the water department, but again, I think the biggest question right now is if we can wait till the next meeting to move this forward, get some legal representation on this, because I don't, if it's an arbitration, that's going against my beliefs as a union supporter, and I can't, if we vote on this, I couldn't support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9897.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and then we'd have to wait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9899.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Instead, I'd ask the table for one week until we get some clarity from legal about voting on something that's in arbitration that is non-union, but was once in union position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9911.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's haven't been negotiated out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9913.417s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's a slippery slope for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9914.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that the vote is in place, but I would maybe think of holding it off for the next meeting and getting some clarity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9923.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That would be my recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9925.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9926.079s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9926.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that a motion or an amendment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9928.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The motion's already in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9929.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would just, my, if... We can amend the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9932.621s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I would motion to table it to the next meeting to get clarity for legal representation about voting on an arbitration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9941.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10243.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10758.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor CASSIDY.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10759.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor CASSIDY.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10787.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You do that to Sylvia?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10850.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, if I can?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10854.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wasn't gonna say anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10856.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that I read those two letters and I can understand the behavior of some members of the community that act so inappropriate that they cross that line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10868.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't stand for that myself, but I don't want to lump in the members that come to this podium that have passion for a topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10879.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and make it seem like, I think like what was said earlier, that they get lumped in together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10886.745s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that personally, I've talked to some people and people have reached out to me and for one, I want to apologize because somebody reached out to me and said, Councilor Scarpelli, you're so abrasive and so aggressive that you actually scare me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10900.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's my personality but I can also see that so I would apologize, but I also think that we have Councilors here tonight that need to publicly apologize the constituents, because of their behavior.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10914.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10916.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what's good for one should be good for all because I think some of our fellow Councilors maybe not understanding or feeling nervous and maybe showing, you know, a giggling or disrespectful manner to people at the at the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10930.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to be honest with you,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10932.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it's not to those ignorant people that do come up and cross that line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10935.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A lot of times you're seeing this behavior to people that just express themselves openly and have that right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10941.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I said to myself, if this is going to be brought up, I'm going to apologize that if I offend anybody, because at the times that I speak,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10952.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with what they put as abrasive manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10955.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's who I am as a person, I'm a loud person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10959.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if you're offended, I apologize that you're offended by the way I present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10963.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same time, I would hope that my fellow colleagues that were praised tonight in these letters that also behaved in a manner that isn't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10972.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: isn't truly what should be expressed by a city councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10976.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would hope they apologize openly to the public like they've done privately, just so everybody's on the same page and everybody is expressing that type of behavior and acknowledging and saying, okay, let's move forward from here and understand that, you know, nodding your head, not paying attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10995.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because one thing I really tried to be totally honest with everybody, since I started as elected official,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=11001.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've had some pretty colorful people at that podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=11004.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I've seen some behaviors from some of my fellow Councilors that they would stand up and walk out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=11010.613s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No matter how much you disrespect that person, getting up and walking out and disrespecting that person is a total disgrace for the seat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=11018.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I would never do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=11020.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whether I believe in what you're saying or don't believe what you're saying, I'm gonna sit here and I'm gonna listen to that person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=11025.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, there has been, you know, I've seen it myself that Councilors make motions that could be represented as disrespectful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=11034.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, like the person who wrote the letters, I don't disagree with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=11041.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that there are people that do cross the line, but that podium's there for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=11046.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that was said the other night in subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=11049.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That podium's set up for everybody to speak their mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=11053.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, when they cross that line,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=11055.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they got to be held accountable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=11056.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's something we need to talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=11058.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But in the same breath, we should all take ownership of some pretty tough couple of weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=11064.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, we've had some pretty intense weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=11066.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there were things that we can all agree to disagree with, but still have the mature and responses and to give the respect to the people that are at the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=11078.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, that's what I feel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=11081.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the letter, even though they didn't put my name in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=11086.575s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm very hurt right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=11088.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=11090.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm going to have Dean to write me a letter next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=11162.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, if I can, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=11164.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd be remiss if I didn't do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=11166.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want to congratulate all the residents of Method that ran the Boston Marathon yesterday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=11171.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=11171.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think, especially my hero, my wife, after being sick for eight straight days on antibiotics, she woke up Sunday and said she's perfectly healthy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=11184.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and she ran the Boston Marathon yesterday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=11186.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A little disappointed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=11188.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She did an hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=11189.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was the worst time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=11190.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to talk about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=11191.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to get her training tomorrow, get her back at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=11194.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I just wanted to tell her how proud we were of her as a husband and as a mom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=11202.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She ran her seventh Boston Marathon yesterday, and she killed it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=144.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, President Beasley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=146.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, a great man, a great family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=149.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And these are the things when you know someone's a true hero, when you realize when no one's watching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=158.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And Jack McGlynn did this for 100 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=164.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He tried to stay under the radar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=166.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's about time that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=168.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He could be recognized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=170.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, he wasn't here, but his family was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=173.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that his children went out to Washington to receive the honor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=180.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that we as a city should really praise and honor people like Jack McGlynn, not for just the service here in the city, in the state, but for also what he did when nobody was watching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=196.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's a true sign of a true hero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=198.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is where, hopefully, there are history books written where Medford students can learn about how important Jack McGlynn was to our community and to our country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=213.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that I'd like to dedicate this meeting to Mr. Jack McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=218.574s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And hopefully, I would recommend that this city finds it within themselves to erect a statue in my eyes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=228.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for that person who did so much for this country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=231.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So he's what Medford's all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=235.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=716.168s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President, and I thank Raising Canes and their representatives<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=725.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=726.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going through the due diligence of making sure that our neighborhood is, um, is involved in all of the signage concerns, and I think that we had a subcommittee that that broke it down, and I think that we made some concessions and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=746.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=755.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're pretty happy with decisions we made and removing a few signs and then keeping signs that are vital to their operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=764.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think the biggest ones were the signs that had the menus on it that were hidden by bushes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=774.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that was a big piece that would question, but the landscaping that's set up<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=780.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it's really going to assist with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=783.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think all the lighting that you'll see on the building is really reflecting on the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=788.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's really nothing that's illuminating the neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=791.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we can listen to the petitioner and then we can move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1210.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1213.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1215.373s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I'm just gonna move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1218.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so I think that with the concessions for the neighbors and for the business that's moving in, I think that we've been pretty thorough with our meetings and informing the neighbors, so I would move forward with the changes as instructed and approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2084.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2084.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2084.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2085.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2086.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2086.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2086.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can't do the chair to Council Kalyan or any other councils that can what documents were we asking for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2092.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2093.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2093.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is an intrusive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2095.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um process and what we're asking for for renters information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2100.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Landlords information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2102.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can anybody share what we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2176.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2177.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's what the big concern is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2179.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we're doing something that sounds like it doesn't need to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2185.148s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've been we've been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2190.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Based on interrupt speakers, I'm gonna ask the room to be silent, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2195.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm hearing dialogue back and forth from fellow councils that we're here to do people's business and we should do some things later on that we'll talk about that we need to do business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2206.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We keep doing business and keep throwing more work onto people that we already know don't have the capability to do what you're asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2214.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're asking for something that's already done<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2216.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: through the city in every way possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2221.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If the biggest thing is just to get the information out to people, there's other ways to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2226.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But to be intrusive and then really take all these unnecessary documents, it makes people very uneasy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2235.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll be honest with you, for a council that's very, very astute in understanding about people that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2241.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I probably most difficult people that are going through a very difficult time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2245.661s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was getting phone calls from landlords saying, George, what do we do hypothetically?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2250.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hypothetically?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2253.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What do you do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2253.584s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the conversation scares our residents, that our landlords allow to give them a place to live, but are afraid to give documentation, because maybe they're undocumented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2266.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they're petrified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2268.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a fear that you should wait when we get to this point, but also understand we're trying to do something over and over again with different issues on this council lately that's redundant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2280.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's putting more work to departments that need to do their work, not to do this additional stuff that we want to get people to know that there is some sort of rebate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2292.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many other ways we can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2294.487s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many other ways we can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2299.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But to keep bringing resolutions through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2304.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's hurting this community and it's driving more wedges through this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2312.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would request that we deny this process and not put more work on more departments that don't need it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7874.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7874.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'm thinking, some of the things my fellow councils aren't understanding is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7881.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The dialogue that started in January and the presentations that we've been putting forward is dividing our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7890.663s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what you're not listening, what you're not understanding is you have to win the trust of people for them to talk to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7898.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let me give you some hints.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7903.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When my fellow Councilors mentioned that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7906.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's 7,500 people voted for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7909.368s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's what they're gonna support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7911.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's wrong message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7912.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The 7,500 people, they got you elected, but you have to work for 60,000 people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7919.477s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so the dialogue that has been going on since we started here, and it's gonna continue with the next resolution, is that we're hurting our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7932.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're dividing our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7934.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our city isn't good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7936.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our city is a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7938.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the dialogue that we're spending is attacking who?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7942.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Homeowners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7944.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything we've done so far, nothing of substance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7948.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We could talk about having subcommittees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7950.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We could talk about all these meetings we're having.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7952.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've got nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7953.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've had nothing done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7955.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think what we're not understanding is what people are saying, maybe because they can't talk to me, maybe because people are reaching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7961.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here's the thing, it's now by the hundreds, and it's people that normally don't come to this podium, you see them tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7969.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whatever you're trying to do, whatever agenda you're trying to pull out, you're hurting people, you're dividing the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7978.187s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's gonna go on, with everything else that we have tonight, we're gonna see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7983.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're trying to justify, I respect you more than anything in the world, all of you, but you're trying to justify things, but you're not looking at the human factor here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7993.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People aren't talking to you, because people don't trust you, Councilor Lemmie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=7997.423s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You haven't earned it yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8007.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'm hearing is, what I'm hearing from a lot of people, I'm hearing a lot of hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8013.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People are hurting because you're attacking them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8018.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what have we been talking about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8021.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What is it we've been working on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8023.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What is the lesson so far?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8024.747s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've talked about rent control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8026.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've talked about a tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8027.929s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've talked about a registry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8030.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've talked about how the firefighters are hurting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8032.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done nothing yet for what the city needs, and the mayor's loving it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8037.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor has done nothing for this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8040.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're five years into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8043.035s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And no matter what happens, this council, I've been around the council 18 years now, whether it's school committee, city council, we've made sure we've at least been the voice so people can, they can come and talk to us because no one's listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8058.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what they're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8060.34s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what everybody's saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8061.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The undertone here, is it really about a registry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8065.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8067.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please, it gets out of control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8070.548s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Listen, I don't like the fact that people yell out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8073.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's just a poor way to get things through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8076.272s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But here's the thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8077.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right now, that's how they feel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8079.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're angry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8083.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And maybe some of you don't know, because I don't want to bring this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8085.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It doesn't matter if you lived here a day or 50 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8088.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hate to hear that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8090.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because everybody, everybody's a method Mustang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8092.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody's a family in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8094.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But right now we're doing nothing but dividing, trying to find a way to deceive and divide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8101.311s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You don't even see it, but it's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8102.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's usually as a marionette.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8104.373s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's like with puppets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8107.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With everything's going on in the city, the city's a mess and people aren't happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8110.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're talking about registries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8113.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what we're saying, people are hurting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8115.999s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This Mia doesn't care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8117.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And she's using us as pawns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8123.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So believe me, publicly, I'm going to tell you this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8128.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I despise the fact that it's George Scarpelli against the rest of the world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8133.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8134.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8136.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want the seven of us to do great things together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8139.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I really do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8141.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8142.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, people can talk negatively about you, Zach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8145.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have done some great things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8147.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have done some great things together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8149.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it's all being overshadowed now by dividing, picking and choosing my group and your group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8156.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And things are going to come out tonight that's going to prove to that it's going to show to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8160.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Look what she's done to the fighting department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8162.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Look what she's done to this council with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8165.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, this is just another piece that's dividing this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8169.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And Councilor Leming, you're an educated person, you're involved, appreciate that you ran, but you have to understand, people here are hurting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8180.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This city is hurting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8181.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This city, whether you wanna believe it or not, is divided more than I've ever seen in my life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8186.035s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we could put a dog and pony show and put lipstick on a pig, and we could do little parades and think that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8191.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not hitting everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8193.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We represent everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8196.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: whether you like me or not, I'm still gonna fight for people that don't like me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9590.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, you can put a lipstick on a pig.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9594.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's still a pig.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9600.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You just heard what this council, what people just were upset about and what we just spun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9606.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm embarrassed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9611.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What goes on in different studies, what goes on in different communities,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9618.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This council, this is the people's forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9620.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is where people come and speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9623.035s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The school community did this a few years back and what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9626.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've eliminated people, they've walked away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9629.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Parents have left the school district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9631.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's no voice there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9634.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're saying this isn't limiting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9635.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The more people are gonna talk?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9638.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You just saw what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9640.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whether they liked it or not, they expressed themselves and people left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9644.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At least they left fulfilled that they had a place to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9649.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but now we're gonna implement the three minute time limit and the 90 minute hired stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9656.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Come on, it's embarrassing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9660.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We were elected for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9662.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're like for the people of city of Medford, just cause it's inconvenient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9665.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You can make, you can say anything you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9667.945s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A listening group, this is a listening group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9670.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have to invent it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9672.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a listening group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9674.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you wanna talk about different,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9678.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You want to talk about different, we have so many other meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9681.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've been to these subcommittees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9683.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's packed, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9684.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People are really joining in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9686.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one's coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9688.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9689.274s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's a farce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9695.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is disingenuine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9698.18s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is not about democracy, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9701.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Someone accused me of not being democratic, not being good for the democracy and the newspaper and this election fight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9709.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9712.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You just listen to people tell you what they felt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9715.427s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're telling you they're hurting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9716.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the next resolution is, let's shut them up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9720.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But no, it's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9721.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, it's not about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9722.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We want them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9723.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We want to hear them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9724.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9726.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't care if one person has to come up here and say things three times the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9730.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9731.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9733.142s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is their forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9736.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They didn't make the choice to only go once a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9739.719s">[Scarpelli]</a>: once, twice a month, that was this council's choice, not mine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9745.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you put things up there, be honest, because those communities, they meet every week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9752.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They have a forum every week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9755.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All we did tonight, after you vote this in tonight, all you've done again is devalue what people want and what people are about in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9766.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So people reached out, told you three minutes,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9769.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I get 1,000 phone calls, people are disgusted about this, and they're not coming in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9774.33s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're forcing them not to come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9775.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe that's what you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9776.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You say that's not what you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9780.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But that's exactly what's going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9785.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm disgusted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9786.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the first time I feel ashamed of being part of this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9790.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're shutting people up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9792.584s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're dismissing them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9796.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're going to keep coming back and forth with resolutions that you're putting forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9799.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's not business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9800.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's your business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9801.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's your agenda business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9804.005s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our city is a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9805.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll say it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9806.466s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done nothing to conquer anything in this community right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9810.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to go to budget season with the mayor that's dictated what's going on and what we're going to do with our money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9816.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we don't even know what we're doing with our money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9819.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I'm glad you put this working group together that was hidden.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9822.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't know about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9828.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is disgusting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9830.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Every single resolution's coming forward now is hurting people and dividing the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9837.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can only sit back and talk to people and say, hey, listen, these are good people, which you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9843.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9847.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So don't tell me you all haven't talked about it because you have, not illegally, but you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9853.666s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I haven't talked to the mayor about any issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9855.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the first time I've heard every resolution you people are putting forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9859.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's doing nothing but dividing this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9863.088s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So like I said, you can spin it any way you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9866.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The bottom line is people are gonna speak less time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9870.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People can only talk for 90 minutes instead of when they feel like they're content and they can walk away and go to sleep at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9881.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And for what, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9884.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All you're doing is hurting the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9887.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Keep following the mayor, you're hurting the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18283.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18284.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I apologize for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18285.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just give me a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18286.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate that teaches waiting because I know tomorrow is a very big meeting with the superintendent, but, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18295.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want my council members to understand a few things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18299.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One, for my friend Maria, though, you don't have to apologize for anybody that came out tonight to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18305.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They have their right to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18306.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to sit there at 12.30 to mention something like that is disingenuine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18312.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's a shame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18314.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But on this situation, we're talking about with, I want us all to take a minute to think back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18322.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want you to take a minute to think back to last year's budget meeting, where this council stood strong against what the mayor was pushing for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18331.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't bring this up to hurt anybody, I just want the timeline to understand something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18337.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're all in favor of the budget being pitiful, and the idea that we had no support from the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18345.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our council leadership met with the mayor behind closed doors, came out,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18350.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and told us they're going to vote for the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18354.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We stressed, please understand what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18357.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're going to balance the budget on ESSER or ARPA money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18360.814s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please don't do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18362.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's gonna put us in dire straits in the future, especially next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18367.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It fell on deaf ears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18370.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It fell on deaf ears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18373.076s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And budget gets passed, we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18377.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We move forward without any knowledge of what's going on financially in the city, even though we've asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18383.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've asked, right before the budget, we got three reports for three separate months, and then they stopped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18389.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I started talking about it again, because it's budget time, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18392.313s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why we haven't seen these actuals, or why we haven't seen any financial documentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18397.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What did we get the other day?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18397.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We got Decembers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18399.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council Bears' leadership is asking for quarterlies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18402.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18404.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But here we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18406.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: on the verge of starting probably the worst budget we'll ever see here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18413.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talk about trust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18414.663s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talk about gaining trust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18417.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what do we see?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18418.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We see the mayor come out of nowhere and put forth a task force to develop a plan, a plan to investments in the city and the school budget operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18430.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll just do no disrespect, Mayor Lungo-Koehn, Nina Nazarian,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18436.311s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council President Bears, Vice Chair Jenny Graham, Vice President Kit Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18445.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No disrespect to any of you, but you're not financial wizards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18450.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You don't know anything about a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18455.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's no finance director on this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18459.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you have minutes of these meetings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18460.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't take minutes of the meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18461.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No minutes of the meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18464.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So here we are, this comes out now, a few weeks before we start our budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18470.544s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's go back a couple of weeks, and what did the mayor ask for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18473.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A rainy day account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18476.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because we have 20 some odd million dollars in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18481.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we all see what's coming, we all see what happened, we're not stupid, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18484.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is how she's gonna save the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18487.609s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now, let's follow up the next week, the school committee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18492.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: put a resolution in supporting the City Council's resolution on the rainy day account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18497.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18497.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because that's how we're going to bail her out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18501.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now I want you to look at the bigger picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18502.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I asked and no one showed up tonight, but I asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18509.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: New growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18512.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Zero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18513.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If the mayor was here, I would ask her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18515.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At the debate she had with Councilor Caraviello, she talked about new growth and these developers that are starting to bring money in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18523.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know for sure we had 340B projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18528.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had development in the city that was bringing in real tax dollars, permit fees to bring us to a level that it's the least we can fight for our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18539.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 340B projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18541.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One, the Gold's Gym site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18544.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've lost their funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18546.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The Bertucci site that she fought in court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18549.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: which you shouldn't fight 40 Bs, but she did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18551.822s">[Scarpelli]</a>: By the way, what'd we talk about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18553.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 600 possible units of affordable housing for my friends that are looking for affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18558.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Bertucci's was a science lab.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18560.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so I apologize, but it was the RISE building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18563.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The RISE development, they went out of business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18567.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We lost them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18569.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have groups that wanted to come into GE, but saw what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18572.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what did they do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18573.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They didn't even ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18576.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have Boston Ave that I'm hearing maybe, possibly, they're talking about maybe another church going there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18583.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We lose total revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18585.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have Medford Square that she said we're on the verge of presenting something to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18590.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing, zero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18593.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mystic Ave, the hottest spot in the country right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18597.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The last land close to Boston, that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18601.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: shovels in the ground, permit fees pulled, zero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18606.236s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hundreds of millions of dollars on permits, on fees, and in tax revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18615.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I bring this up for a point because the teachers are gonna come up and talk about a dire situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18621.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this council's number one initiative, mine as well, is making sure we fund our school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18626.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At what cost though?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18629.065s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At what cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18631.65s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we have a school committee issue that they lose $2.5 million were in their deficit, then all of a sudden they find it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18641.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what I heard doesn't appease me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18645.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18645.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In the real world, someone goes down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18647.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In the real world, someone's going to hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18649.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18650.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's bad business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18651.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is tax dollars that they lost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18653.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then they found on a Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18657.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we talked about I know she talked about we talked about over proposition to an F override, we're talking about probably $250 million new high school, which we all want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18670.855s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But careful what you wish for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18673.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because all she's using you all she's using us as as scapegoats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18680.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I believe the words she told a friend of mine that's told somebody that, you have to give a little to get a little.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18685.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So maybe they'll get the proposition due in a half, she'll support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18689.18s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe she wouldn't fight it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18690.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe she wouldn't veto it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18694.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is where truth comes in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18697.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is where trust comes in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18700.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is gonna be very difficult, because I know the story the teachers are gonna tell us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18705.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what that letter went out, that letter went out to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18708.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She, superintendent sent me an email today, it was only sent to the leadership team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18715.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That went out like wildfire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18716.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had parents call me tell me they should they leave the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18720.096s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had teachers call me tell me they're applying elsewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18722.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm saying no, no, you're tenured.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18725.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I'm gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18728.92s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I want us to prepare and understand this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18732.582s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Make sure<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18734.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When it comes to the budget season, and we're gonna have to vote on it, make sure you understand what you're gonna vote on this time, because last year, she suckered you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18745.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We got nothing that we asked for, zero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18749.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And in the meantime, all of a sudden they put this committee, she announces this committee, maybe even working since the fall, she announces this committee, when?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18759.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right after this letter comes out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18762.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: big press release.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18763.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're finally looking at the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18765.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are you kidding me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18766.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's been in office four and a half years now, four and a half years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18770.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you know the only new growth we have in our community of substance was off of traffic and parking, by taxing and fees to our residents for parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18786.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Imagine in five years, our new growth<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18790.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is to Cuba and a beer hall on Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18796.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm going to tell you this is going to be shocking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18798.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But guess what, everyone, we're going to be in some serious crap in a few weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18803.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're going to hear is going to be terrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18805.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm going to tell you something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18807.311s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's going to sit in her office and she's going to tell us to make the decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18811.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18814.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wish the Alicia Hunt was here because we don't see true growth at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18821.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't see any movement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18822.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't see any new growth coming in with development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18825.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the development that we lost, they weren't in neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18829.041s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They weren't changing neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18831.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They weren't commercial areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18835.868s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we still have heard nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18838.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I apologize for you for waiting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18841.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know you have a big tomorrow, MCAS, I guess, tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18844.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have a big meeting tomorrow with the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18846.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She told me, by the way, everybody's invited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18849.258s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a Zoom meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18851.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Very important meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18852.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Probably the biggest meeting they'll have in the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18856.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The biggest meeting of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18858.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they won't even sit face to face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18860.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're having a Zoom meeting tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18863.466s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But everybody's welcome, she said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18866.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So at five o'clock, by the way, I'll be getting out of work running to awake and I'll jump on as quickly as I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18872.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I apologize for waiting, but I know this is important and I appreciate your patience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18877.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18975.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18976.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18977.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is exactly what I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18980.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This leads exactly to the dialogue that you presented, Council President, for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18986.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'm saying to you is, understand, she's run the city for five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18992.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't see the financial picture at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=18995.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So until we know the financial picture of what she's done, because maybe 2025 looks great, but she had four years and she's done nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=19005.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why we are where we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=19007.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to give her more money, so she can throw more away?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=19015.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We keep funding her, keep saving her with money, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=19019.868s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's no guarantees that she'll do anything that you think she'll do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=19024.233s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Remember, we wanted what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=19025.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A city solicitor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=19028.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=19040.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're still talking about a huge shortfall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=19044.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have exactly done enough actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=19047.981s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a law show me there's a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=19052.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There is no money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=19053.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Show me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=19054.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=19054.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there's nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=19055.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=19057.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This council that mayor has done nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=19062.794s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing to grow the school department and the teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=19067.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But you can go along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=19068.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Trust Councilor Scarpelli trust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=19071.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Remember we talked about collaboration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=19073.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=19075.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been telling you that I've been collaborate with you in her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=19079.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the revolution or her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=19081.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=19082.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And where's that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=19084.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And where's the need?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=19086.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Where's the divide coming?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=19087.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You keep having meetings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=19090.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20902.827s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We were hoping that someone would be here tonight before the big meeting tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20906.929s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So a representative, so she emailed us, let us know she couldn't come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20911.331s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I wanted to make sure that the teachers had a voice tonight before tomorrow's meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20916.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was the hope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20917.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the superintendent, we would have rather had the superintendent here and her financial team to answer some of these questions that I think are a huge burden, but obviously that's not,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20931.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: about what we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20949.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sometimes emotions get the better of me, but I will tell you that the problem we're seeing, and I think that this is what's frustrating, is that although we all identify that the schools are not one priority, we're still the financial stewards of this whole community, the whole city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20965.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, we talked about, we talked about our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20971.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what's going on with the custodians.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20973.763s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't talked about the police that don't have contracts, the 911 operators that don't have contracts, that the COLA, I think the COLA, I don't know what the COLA is right now, but that's not looking good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20986.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, I mean, there's so much, but I think my frustration with Councilor Bears now, we joke about his initiatives and we, you know, and I understand that this is where, maybe it is, maybe you'll get a vote from me one day for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21001.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe it will be, but again, in a more calming fashion, understanding the waste that we're seeing and hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21013.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the investigations, the lawsuits, the settlements, the consultants, on and on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21022.747s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is dead empty money that we could have used this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21028.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you say you've done your work, I apologize for disrespecting you because I'm sure you did some work, but the questions that need to be answered aren't being asked for some reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21040.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if you're, as our leadership team, you're with there, find out what we paid KP Law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21047.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Find out what we paid out for all these lawsuits that we lost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21052.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Find out what it costs to take all these 40 Bs to task in court and then appeal it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21059.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is money that we lost, money that we should, so were there shortfalls?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21063.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I guarantee there was shortfalls, I'm sure there's shortfalls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21066.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as the stewards of our financial budget here in this city, all of it, because when we're talking about, listen, we're gonna, I hope we don't lose teachers, but we're gonna lose firefighters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21080.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna lose police officers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21082.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna lose 911 operators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21084.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna lose custodians.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21087.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna be in a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21090.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At least that's what I was told from what I'm hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21095.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I haven't, I know you've had talks with them, but you haven't shared anything with this Councilor about the outlook or the financial outlook that you're hearing from these meetings, or if you're even giving those meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21107.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's where my frustration comes in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21109.51s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you might be meeting with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21110.911s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when you say you've talked to your, I haven't heard one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21115.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The only thing I've heard is what I've asked for, for the city, for the administration to pass on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21121.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we got December, what did December tell us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21125.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You saw them, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21126.424s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What did December tell us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21127.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $78,000 between the schools in the city for KP law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21134.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's December.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21136.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a holiday month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21139.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So just imagine, this is what I'm saying about, before, listen, if we could show data that shows, listen, that, hey, everything's on the up and up, and it's not mismanaged, and all this money that we've lost,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21152.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that if it's funneled in the correct way and managed the correct way, then maybe we just need an override, or maybe we need something different, a debt exclusion to help some things, or maybe we can take some free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21166.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we don't know the true financial picture, because no one's telling us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21170.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe they're not telling you either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21172.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would assume they haven't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21175.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think this is where my frustration comes in, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21178.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that this is why<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21180.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm at a loss because I was part of the negotiating team when I was a teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21185.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then as a school kid member, we sat there and listen, I sat there with John Falco and Billy O'Keefe and we told the mayor, this is what we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21195.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mike McGlynn didn't give you a thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21198.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But he came back the next meeting, an emergency meeting, found $600,000 to make sure we can get what we needed for our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21206.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So as we're moving forward to this week,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21209.437s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and these, especially tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21213.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The way that it was all presented, it was a scared tactic for our teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21218.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what got me more fired up is I talked to parents are taking their kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21221.582s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How many times we had tonight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21223.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How many times did we hear tonight the parents are taking kids out of the public schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21228.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: By the way, that hurts us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21230.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because we get reimbursed, it goes by number of pupils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21235.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we lose them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21237.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21239.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a lot of frustration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21240.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=22.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=25.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=27.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=768.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2139.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2140.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hate to be a stickler, but if you can, if we can sever that piece with the, uh, KP law, um, anything dealing with KP law, I won't be, um, in favor of, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2152.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So just, uh, if that could be done, I'd appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2156.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate everybody's hard work on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2158.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2501.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2503.539s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2505.18s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2530.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hotly pursued, love it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2542.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=517.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=520.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Chair, I think this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=524.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, first, I think the Election Commission does the best they can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=528.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, you know, Henry and his team try to stand above it all, but there are some huge deficiencies that were realized in November and then magnified again for the federal elections past March, which<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=548.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that brings me to my conclusion that, you know, appreciate the reports, but reports mean nothing when the same thing keeps happening over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=559.514s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I feel that this council should ask the administration or demand that the administration call for an outside audit to come in and audit and educate our election department and commission and support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=574.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the, you know, the counting of the ballots, the process of that, the counting of the ballots, the voting process that's in place and the lack of education for our poll workers and the lack of guidance of understanding what their jobs and roles are done on a person to person basis and polling location, polling location basis is very different and it opens up<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=602.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: an avenue for distrust and for confusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=608.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, let me repeat, most importantly, it's not the poll workers' fault.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=613.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The poll workers' fault are doing exactly what they know what to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=619.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They haven't been trained, they haven't been vetted properly to make sure that they're given the tools to succeed, and I think that's been a huge problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=630.532s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we, as a council, asked, oh God, years ago, to look at our voting list and to eliminate all of the people that are in the election list and clean that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=649.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=651.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you're having households receiving ballots when they don't even live there anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=656.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have people that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=659.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: are on the voter registration list when you go into vote and you're seeing people that moved out of your own neighborhood when you look down 10, 15 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=668.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You see voters, Medford voters that have passed on that are off in heaven and still are on a voting list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=674.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a lot that can be done to help our poll workers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=678.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one thing we need to do, unless we try to get ahead of it right now, I think we'll never catch up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=683.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we need to put some funding and some support to this venture right now, before the federal election, to make sure that we have crossed our T's and dotted our I's in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=698.459s">[Scarpelli]</a>: whatever we saw in November, whatever we saw in November, in our elections in November, we saw some we witnessed some similar issues that happened in March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=711.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said this before the November elections, I said, please, perception is reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=719.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whatever we need to do,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=721.297s">[Scarpelli]</a>: whatever this council needs to do, let's help the administration give them what they need to make sure that this doesn't happen again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=731.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they're happening again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=734.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm sure you've heard all the rumors about, you know, who's come into the city, the investigations that are going on in the city, you know, different different federal departments talking to people interviewing people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=747.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's, it's, it's, it's scary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=751.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for the fact that one of these days something's gonna happen and we're gonna be left holding the bag.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=760.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because listen, we know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=762.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know there are issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=763.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know that there are serious issues as a council, we know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=767.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we need to give<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=770.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the commission the tools that they need in the election department, the staffing and the tools they need to properly educate to properly inform to properly hold an election and making sure we're giving them all the tools possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=785.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think one of the biggest things you start with first is looking at our role looking at our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=793.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: people that are on the on the election roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=797.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: See, see if they're even living here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=800.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: See if they passed away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=801.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because what is it they're saying is 45 registered 45,000 registered voters 42,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=805.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=810.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't see that at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=811.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think there's a big piece that, you know, you have election workers going through numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=817.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have, you know, poll workers going through numbers that aren't even there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=821.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then that causes more issues because, you know, you heard what happened in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=824.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You had more line, you had a bigger line of people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=828.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: waiting in a separate line because they were told that they weren't registered voters when you had former city councilors that were told that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=837.579s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's not, this isn't good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=840.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that we need to, as the reports, we appreciate the report that came back, we understand and we see some of the inequities, but what I don't see is a clear path to fixing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=854.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If tonight's tonight's meeting was to hear what they were going to say, and see what the administration is going to say, see what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=861.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then I hope at the end of this, that we have a clear vision of what we need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=867.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this doesn't happen at the presidential election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=873.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=875.486s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, I would ask the chief of staff, how often do you see a chief of staff running an election?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=882.69s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That doesn't look good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=884.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that just doesn't look good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=887.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whether whether there's nothing there or something there, it just doesn't look good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=891.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not having a chief of staff running your elections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=895.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's it's it's it speaks volumes and where we are and we need to we need to figure this out before the next election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=902.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate Mr. Chair for letting me share my opinions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=907.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as for one, I'll be one council that will support any endeavor that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=913.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: will lend support to the commission and the election department to make sure they have all the tools possible that the same issues don't happen again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=923.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Ballots going out when they shouldn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=926.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Too many ballots going to people's homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=930.051s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Election numbers not being tabulated in the proper timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=933.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Numbers that not not being released in a proper timeline, poll workers that don't understand the protocol from one polling station to another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=941.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=945.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=945.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like I said, it leads to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=948.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Perception being reality, and that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=950.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want that to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=952.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1921.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1922.159s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Caraviello?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1923.52s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We wouldn't know, to my fellow councilors that I've mentioned, but we wouldn't know, but that will, from what I hear is when I've talked to different elections commissions and other communities, this is just a basic fundamental process that could be done with a consultant that can come in and do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1944.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that would eliminate that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1947.02s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, like I said, perception's reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1949.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We all see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1951.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's something that might not be a priority, but it's a piece that needs to be cleaned up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1954.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=23.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=953.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=957.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=959.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate Councilor Collins going through these different scenarios, but for the newer members, I think the biggest piece that was really frightening for the business, especially coming out of the pandemic when we first started this discussion, if we all remember, was the protection of the brick and mortar businesses and, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=982.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: different out of city vendors coming in and not having the same requirements, but just coming in and taking business away from our brick and mortar who pay in and committed to our community for forever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=997.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, as long as they're there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=999.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I do agree with Councilor Bears though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1003.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, you wish that there's a more, more, just an easier answer to this, because the whole idea that the premise that we've been working on is really, you know, when the mayor has a program that, that a school might have a function and they want to bring in a food truck, that it's, it's, it's easier just to go to the, go to a separate department and have that permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1030.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1031.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, I this can this can get very convoluted as we hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1037.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But, you know, my hope is was that with this, we'd get to a point where it would be streamlined and not so cumbersome that if there was an emergency situation, if there was an issue with with, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1053.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: different organizations within our city, whether it's school or a fundraising organization that wanted a food truck for a special day is just that it streamlines to the health department that the biggest issue was that all the health codes were really covered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1073.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the where the bollards are and where the placement and all that stuff I think that it you know it could we could we find a way to streamline it and say that permits that are on that are in safe areas and in on city grounds because if you if you look at most of them<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1097.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that come before us, they're at the schools, they're at the shell, they're at the different parks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1106.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's a way that we can just put some language in that ordinance that we don't have to bring in 16 different parties just to make sure that we can accommodate these vendors for special events without<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1124.164s">[Scarpelli]</a>: keep picking at this and making it more than it really is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1127.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1262.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so again, that's not if I'm sorry, sorry to interrupt point of information, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1280.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, do you have a point of information?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1283.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, just, I think the biggest, our biggest, you know, the understanding is that the food truck, the food truck ordinance, even if it was on school grounds, it still comes to us because our protection of brick and mortar, the school department doesn't, you know, we've already gone over this with the solicitor years ago, that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1305.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that they don't have the right we have as the city council this is why we we had it in the first place is to make sure we protected our brick and mortar buildings and school department that's like saying the school department can offer uh free um have every every saturday have um food truck alley at at uh at uh the brooks and um and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1333.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that leaves our brick and mortar and West Medford Square left without any business for that week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1339.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I respectfully disagree with our council just to make sure I don't wanna lose the most important piece here, which is protecting our brick and mortar businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1448.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So be careful, because this is going to bring us all the way back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2018.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, point of information with that, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2027.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry that I'm not there, but this is gonna bring us all the way back to the beginning because this was what we explained to our business community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2037.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the reason why we went this way is because of that safeguard that they knew that this council would make sure we were protecting our brick and mortar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2047.859s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we now leave this open to other entities to come in and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2055.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: do special permits every Saturday, and it's allowed in separate departments, whether it's the parks department saying that we'll use Placestead Park to do something, you know, and it just leaves it to a slippery slope, and it's going to open up that, you know, it's going to open up that can of worms again that we started years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2077.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I just think that we should be very careful as we move forward with this now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2082.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2137.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Mr. President,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2140.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2143.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think having the authority to issue the special permit under the city council gave us that safety and that sense of understanding and acceptance with our brick and mortar businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2161.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But now as we're trying to find a more streamlined way to help our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2167.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: help our citizens that programs that want that one day permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2174.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we take the special permit out of the city council and leave it to the board of health, then we lose that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2181.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We lose that sense of control where our business and our business districts and have entrusted us when we first started this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2194.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2561.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2562.048s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With all due respect to the representative council from KP Law, I think we're talking right now two separate issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2571.671s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And for the sake of public finance, I say that we stop and reevaluate as a council and put this in order so it can be presented with all of the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2587.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm a little shocked that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2589.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that how we presented it maybe this was our fault by not presenting all the documentations from the beginning of this process but this isn't something that started in 2022 or 23 with with the brooks school this started years before that and making sure that that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2608.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the understanding that the council is the authority that distributes the or votes on the special permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2619.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I'm going to say this again to make sure all our new councils understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2623.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This was a gigantic issue with our business community, a brick and mortar community that was very, very controversial, very intense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2633.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I just don't want to continue this dialogue because we're, I think we're talking two totally different, different things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2640.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe the council is focused on one piece of this, this, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2646.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this request that we asked for, but we're missing the whole beginning of the race.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2653.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're doing right now is finishing the race.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2655.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just missed the first 23 miles of the Boston Marathon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2658.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't want to continue this for the sake of funding reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2665.477s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2666.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, attorneys are a lot of money and we can sit there for another two hours talking about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2671.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, uh, I'll do requests that would motion that we, we, um, table this and until we regroup as a council and get all of the information that the attorney on record is, is, um, is given so we can make a, a decision without, without stirring up the, uh, the business community again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2693.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=3720.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Great, so motion of Vice President Collins to- Great, on the motion of Vice President Collins, seconded by?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=571.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=578.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If this is the way we're going, I think that in all reality, to put a paper out like this, I don't want it to be presented as the other departments in the community like DPW, fire, police are being left off that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=593.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would motion that either we add those city departments to that list,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=602.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if that's how we're going to break it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=605.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because, you know, the optics of something that reads as Vice President Collins wants to move forward, which I don't disagree, but we're going to be getting to some nitty gritty budget issues when it comes time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=628.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want the perception to go out to say, well, we want to maintain these budgets, but it's okay for cuts that the city council wouldn't support the cuts of police or cuts the fire or cuts the DPW.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=644.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think in other city departments, whether it's a secretarial staff, whether it's the veteran services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=651.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just think by wording it that way, it opens it up for a slippery slope for what the message should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=661.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's, we wanna be level funded with all city entities and school entities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=985.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The court of public opinion would throw out and say, well, here we go again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=989.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The council doesn't want to do X, Y, and Z. So I think if it's phrased that way, I think that speaks volumes because we don't want to lose any of these positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1000.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the fear of losing Penny's position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1002.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we lost Penny, but losing Penny's position, I think, would be a huge, huge loss to our community, especially in what she's done for drug prevention and awareness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1015.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1033.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if I can, Mr. President, I can see this, the hard work you've done, but are we meeting, are we still going to have the department meetings and are they going to be open and honest discussions, you think,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1048.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with department heads?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1066.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But that is my hope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1068.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think having in the past, not the last few years, but going back four or five years, we would get an update from my finance director of the state of the state and see what kind of, what the climate looks like and what our funding would look like from the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1087.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't know if the mayor has discussed anything with you about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1092.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: giving us some clarity as we get closer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1096.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because like I said, all you hear is, you know, different communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1102.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they've already been given some sort of understanding of what's happening in the state and what their community is going to be looking at for funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1109.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it doesn't look too promising.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1110.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I wonder if we'll be getting some information that can help us prepare our constituents as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1306.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would support that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1307.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1308.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1310.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would support that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1311.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's been our biggest cry for the last three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1314.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that we've all been pushing together for that because that helps us do our jobs better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1321.768s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And having someone here, I think even somebody neutral<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1329.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with contentious issues in the city where it's not coming from the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1333.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it helps having a city solicitor come up and say, hey, this is what other communities have done for a transfer tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1341.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is the reason, legally, why X, Y, and Z. We don't have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1346.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It seems like we have a divide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1349.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: KP Law has already mentioned that they don't work for this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1354.719s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that brings up another contentious issue that everybody keeps harping on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1362.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whether we are or whether we're not, we just don't know because we haven't seen the actuals that break down KP laws, what they've been paid the last few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1374.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that stuff would help with really helping us grow and get together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1379.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1381.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think if we can too, Mr. President, if we can, number nine, for the DPW cement and hot top, I appreciate you putting that up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1393.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I mean, even if we can reach out in a form of a motion to ask the DPW director,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1399.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: just to do an analysis of what it would cost for a three team and equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1404.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's something that when I did it, it took me maybe three days with the director of DPW in Somerville and the director of DPW in Wakefield at the time that helped me get those numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1417.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then just show us, give us an idea of what we spent in bonding and how it's these issues that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1430.051s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we've had the data and it's presented and they say, George, what we're spending for this staff plus the benefits in the equipment is definitely less more than what it would cost to bond the $2 million a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1444.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's an easy look at something to say, okay, that's just not efficient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1451.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But that can also come back the other way and say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1455.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: while a crew of three can do X, Y, and Z, but I think it would help us moving forward to make some big decisions moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1465.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't see it happening in this budget, from what I hear, where we're gonna be, but maybe down the line, we'll have things in place that would help us make better fiscal decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1476.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1538.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Either out of here or out of there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1539.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just to get it before the budget season, I think that just an understanding so we know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1920.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1921.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1922.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is where I get a little confused because it's the functions<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1929.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you hear some of the issues with the finance department, the software, is it truly that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1937.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that truly hasn't been defined yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1943.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because some of the information we're getting from the previous finance director, the information was the same software that's being used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1952.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would recommend that maybe getting more staffing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1956.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and moving that forward, because I'd like to see a cost analysis to that to see what it would take if it's a $80,000 software system that we have to pay year after year, purchase once and then pay year after year, in comparison to hiring an assistant in the finance department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1978.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It'd be interesting to see what that would look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1984.076s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just, you know, a lot of it, a lot of the financial questions we have, I think revert back to not being communicated, not being transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1993.258s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, I don't, I don't really trust the administration when they say it's the software system that's antiquated because the finance department that worked at the beginning of your tenure, Mr. Mr. President,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2011.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At the beginning of my time at the council, we were updated and we were informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2018.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And those pieces were in place to make sure that, for instance, the retro pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2028.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That system was in place when contracts were ratified years ago that did the work to make sure that our employees were given their<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2041.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: retro pay and reasonable time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2044.796s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I, again, I just, I, I don't want to be the pessimist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2049.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to be the, the, the, this, the, you know, the, the, the siren every time, but I, I don't want us to throw good money after bad when it could be something that it's just management, not system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2678.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Motion report paper to the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2682.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=166.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=168.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: public should know too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=169.353s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that this council, I think way back a few years ago, when we started with Mr. Borbowski and changing our zoning codification and moving this forward, I think this is a big piece that we haven't seen in Medford in a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=182.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what I like is that this process really allows the community to get involved<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=189.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and neighborhood to neighborhood to make sure that everybody is part of the solution of what you want your method to look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=196.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that council bears did a lot of hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=199.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we made sure that was in the budget to make sure that that funding was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=205.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not going to be cheap, but I think it's something that we haven't seen in how many years now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=214.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 60 years, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=216.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's a good message to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=220.304s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=361.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I think that I had some opposition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=363.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the idea is sound.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=365.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we still, I haven't heard at least that we have put together a plan on how we're going to get this letter out<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=374.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=375.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think drafting a newsletter that can only be reached by a few and not all, I think it's, I just think it's a slippery slope like I told you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=385.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just think that if it's not reaching our most<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=390.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: needy community members and without having a plan in place because I don't think we've invited anybody from communications to work with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=398.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we're moving things forward and we still haven't got any answers, at least for me, as we're going forward with this and how we're going to move this newsletter forward, where is it going to go to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=410.859s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's going to go to people that are already in the know for the most part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1186.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, no, it's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1187.268s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When they're done, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1327.247s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1327.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1328.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpellilli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1329.169s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1329.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First, working in Somerville, I think that our community, especially when I was coaching, we saw the benefits that CHA provided for our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1341.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And being there and having an on-site office at Somerville High School paid huge dividends for our kids, especially our kids with need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1352.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The biggest question that we'll hear whenever you hear of an ambulatory center or hospital setting that's coming into your community, what are people thinking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1362.364s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Loss, tax base, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1365.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what is, you said a lot of great things that you do in Somerville, Revere, Cambridge, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1374.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everett.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1376.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What is CHA going to come for Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1378.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What are we going to see from Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1379.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're coming over the line, right over the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1381.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that with public transportation, you're still going to get the sum of residents is still going to benefit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1387.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Your residents coming from that are still going to benefit from that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1390.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My question is, what is CHA?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1393.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What are we going to do to really become part of our community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1396.922s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are they actively trying to pursue some sort of outreach, maybe to set up a site at Medford High School, like we have at Summerville High or Cambridge High School, where we can benefit?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1409.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: from having CHA in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1411.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think being on the outskirts sounds great because Somerville still benefits from it, but they now have another area where they can now have a huge tax base where the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1425.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: facility is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1426.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if you could share anything that can help constituents that have been reaching out to me and saying, Well, here we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1434.456s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Another loss of tax base, and it's still in some of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1531.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, that was a great asset.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1557.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1558.78s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, I think that I know it's a public meeting, so we have to open it, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1565.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's, especially if we have the access to tap into a CHA to help our neediest members of our community, I think this would be a win-win, especially if the naysayers that are afraid of taxes won't be affected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1581.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would support it once we move through the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1872.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1872.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll be in for our physicals next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1874.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1875.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1880.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1881.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, can I suspend the rules to move paper 24053 to the head of the line there, Mr. President, if we can?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1922.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1923.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This was something that was put forth weeks ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1926.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that President Buckley was here patiently, and I appreciate you allowing us to move this to the front.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1936.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that to go back a little bit<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1939.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had, at the time, something that I have a resolution later that we could bring up, but I know that the mayor asked to make some drastic changes for our leadership team in the fire department, which caused a lot of uneasiness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1955.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Part of that stemmed from accusations of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1962.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: sick leave, sick time taken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1965.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And while this was going on, Medford had one huge fire, I believe a three alarm here in Medford, and then assisted and I believe a five alarm in Chelsea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1977.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Along with that, I know that I've talked to many firefighters and, and they<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1985.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to their words, feeling very unstable and very nervous, in a sense, in their working conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=1994.827s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I wanted Mr. Buckley, if you could, come up and just give us just a quick update on how our men and women are doing and how the process is so far with Chief Evans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2007.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2168.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's one of the questions that came about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2170.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I talked to a few firefighters that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2174.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that are afraid to come up and mention that they were, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2180.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe one of them told me one of the stations had a terrible case of the stomach virus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2187.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there were a lot of identified dehydrated firefighters at one time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2193.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, I just don't understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2195.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just take your time off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2196.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that this is what this is where the dialogues that's the plan when you bring politics and why you need to bring politics into the situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2209.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2210.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: of discussion from the beginning of these issues we've had here is that we want to keep politics out of the firefighters purview and, you know, stop being there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2221.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, one member told me that not being that being their voice, you know, having being part of that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2228.051s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that what I'm hearing from them and the reason why I asked you to come up is the fact that we have firefighters that are sick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2237.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2238.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they're afraid to come to this podium, and they're afraid to who they can speak to for the fact of retaliation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2247.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's a huge problem for public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2250.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that, I don't know, I don't know if there's an answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2253.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know if there's an avenue that I can propose that whether I know that the mayor was contemplating some sort of investigation, I think it was- As far as I know, we're still under investigation, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2269.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Still under investigation, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2271.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think these are the questions that will go to my, I don't wanna bring this up now, but go to my resolution later that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2280.814s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, we want to get to a resolve as quickly as possible and have our method firefighters move forward to do the job that they've been paid to do and what they've been doing honorably even through this this fiasco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2294.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2296.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, other than that, I know that there are still issues with some facilities and what I'm going to ask is, we've done this a few years, we did this a few years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2305.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to, with the clerk, I know we did like a walking tour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2309.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We did a Saturday morning and we just visited, we picked maybe three houses and, you know, it could be random, you guys could tell us where to go, but we visit the actual fire houses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2321.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can all see what's been said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2325.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And until you see it, and that's why I think I have a little more fire because I walked that walk and I saw some of the conditions that our fire men and women have to live through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2336.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they never bring this up, but I think that it would behoove us that we actually, you know, maybe set up a walking tour on a Saturday to some of our stations and visit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2354.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, if we can do that through the clerk as a motion that we can just maybe go visit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2358.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It doesn't have to be all of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2359.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe, you know, if we can't make it, maybe two or three of us just go and just report back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2382.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2383.613s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think especially as we go into the budget season, we look at the capital plan and follow the mayor's capital plan to see if we can go with that, I think is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2391.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I don't want to take your night, Mr. Buckley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2395.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know maybe my fellow council have something to say, but I just, I really wanted you to come up and really just, these are the issues that I heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2401.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know the other thing was that was being spun as part of the dialogue of wasted money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2408.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, we talked about the chief now being in place and,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2413.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did we rectify that cost that was going around that she promoted two deputies, correct, or two lieutenants?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2436.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so the big question we had was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2439.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We were losing money up to about close to $60,000 for overtime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2447.076s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Has that been rectified?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2448.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we still backfilling any positions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2484.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I remember it's 125, the number that's at least workable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2490.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we're budgeted for 124.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2534.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This was really made just to get the how everybody's doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2537.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that all plays into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2538.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that, again, I really wanted to hear what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2541.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And at the time was really about what was going on with the chief's issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2545.186s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And those two fires and that just lend our support to the to the men and women on the fire department that especially that week, that the city of method appreciates, you know, everything you guys have done, because mom,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2558.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that the fire was streamed everywhere, the one on Riverside Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2563.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I, what was great to see is everybody worked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2566.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was just, even though there was no acting chief at the time, the team looked amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2572.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I just, that's why I wanted to bring it up the next week, just to, sometimes people just need a pat on the back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2577.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that, you know, if I'm gonna, as many times I've called and we went at it over some disagreements, but at the same time, when you deserve a pat on the back, you should get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2588.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2710.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, that's not for this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2712.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can just I think that we could set up a working group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2715.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It doesn't have to be all of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2716.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like I said, just work with the secretary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2723.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this is an amendment, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2725.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can't with the member just to see if we can put together just a walking meeting to the sites just to walk to the fire stations and so we can actually see what, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2737.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what we hear and, you know, put, once we put the sight on, eyes on it, I think it'll make a difference for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2744.272s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it made a huge difference for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2746.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And people ask me, George, did they save your life?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2749.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are you really, really going overboard sometimes at the fight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2752.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they say, you must have saved me during my first heart attack.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2756.115s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said, not yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2757.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, but I'm staying in good grace a sec.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2760.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what the question was that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2763.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Once you go through that tour and you see, you know, there was one station that you had the fitness apparatus right next to the exhaust and it was like- Still there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2774.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's still, that hasn't been fixed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2779.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so I mean, these are the things when you look at, you're gonna be like, you know, with the carcinogens and you're hearing about all these serious issues, health issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2786.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think these are the things that once,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2789.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think once people go and you actually walk a fire station, not to get one of those funny little helmets, but actually see what's going on and see where our female firefighters have to change and where their bathrooms are and understand the windows that can't open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2807.233s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I hope those have been corrected, but these are the things once you see it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2815.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think what you see it, I think that it'll, it'll put everybody's, it'll put things in a different light for everybody here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2820.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, I think that's why I'm a little, a little more motivated when it comes to our firefighters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2826.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, you know, nothing against our police, but you guys live the life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2831.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You guys have a spot at the police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2834.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have massage in the new, new stage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2836.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2843.035s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But all right, if we can, that's, you know, I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2845.917s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the civil service, I know that there was also brought to my attention that even this process right now, that the mayor is going forward looking for either the deputies or lieutenants moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2857.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a civil service process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2859.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That is it true that the mayor isn't following that either?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3409.331s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We did that, I think, six years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3559.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, I think, I don't know, while we're in here, do we want to just go through the 240541, just to, it's in the same breath.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3588.719s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3609.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3612.258s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I think that a lot of people are here because of this situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3615.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So just to move the night along, I think it's important that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3621.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that this was a resolution that was brought forward with the concerns and the issues of the fact that the mayor had asked the city council to vote on eliminating the position of chief process through civil service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3638.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that morning of our meeting, she already had somebody in the office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3644.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She was interviewing someone already in the office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3647.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: without this council even approving that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3649.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this council heard questions from the firefighters and the administration, and we asked to try to come to a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3659.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The council needed another meeting with the mayor, and you would think for the sense of morale, I think right now, and something I think we've all identified, that one thing has nothing to do with the other thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3674.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: civil service doesn't have anything to do with this so-called investigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3678.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to hold this off for two more months, to leave these firefighters in a certain feeling of being unsure of what's going on and leaving this, it really puts it back on us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3695.541s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what I would recommend, Mr. President, if you allow me to make a motion<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3703.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3706.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: few things is that this situation with the mayor is a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3710.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor created a through this on the city council's lap, and it was irresponsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3716.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It caused outrage among our community and has put us all at risk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3720.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor was gung ho when she filed this paper, but now she needs more time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3725.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's clear that this matter was not properly vetted, and it was retaliatory in nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3729.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's nothing more than a knee jerk reaction to an unrelated and substantial allegation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3735.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The record of this body reflects the agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3738.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This action was both irresponsible and not well thought out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3742.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There is no place for politics when it comes to public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3746.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the mayor can refile this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3750.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would make the motion that the mayor can refile this paper when she gets her ducks in a row.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3757.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this issue is a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3761.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that she's created, and the council should not be left holding the bag while concerned residents lay in wait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3767.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I move that this paper be received and placed on file, and the mayor can come back in future time and put this through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3773.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I ask my council to vote in favor of this for one big reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3776.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is to really calm the community down and say, listen, we understand after time, we've all had time to think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3783.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've had a lot of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3784.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The questions that I've talked to some of my fellow councils about, maybe you could tell me if I'm wrong, really stems from understanding the policy of the sick time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3793.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It had nothing really to do with the civil service issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3796.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, the civil service issue isn't that important to the mayor because she doesn't want to meet for two months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3801.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's already responded to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3802.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my my hope is that we can see that let's put everybody at ease that's been directly affected and put this to rest if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3811.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then she could bring this up when she's ready and take it off our plate, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3815.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I make that a formal motion if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3817.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3841.636s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I think like, I think that it's a clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3844.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So everybody, everybody knows out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3846.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So our, our city council rules state that if we move this, we cannot dispose of it until it's heard in the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3855.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3856.183s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3857.824s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we should revisit the mayor and ask her to really move up that timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3864.953s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I recommend that the constituents that have reached out to me about this issue, that there's only one person that we can reach out to, send the mayor an email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3873.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: send them email saying, dispose of this or meet right away to get this off the plate of our of our fighter fighters minds and let them be at ease.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3883.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, because this is something that whatever might be minuscule to most people, but if any, just an ounce of negativity,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3891.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that our firefighters can take off their shoulders, why would we do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3894.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would make that recommendation to all that's listening to send the mayor a message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3900.051s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know I'll try, it'll fall on deaf ears, but I would recommend that as our leadership, if we can revisit that and send a message to the mayor to have an immediate meeting and not wait two months, because the optics doesn't look good either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3915.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People have asked me, he's like, why two months?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3917.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, we have no control of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3919.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The council president has no control of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3921.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor has said she wants to wait two months, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=3942.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry, revert back to regular business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4060.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's no joke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4997.766s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think whenever we look at something that hasn't been touched since 1990, right, there's two things that can happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5003.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Either it's either fraudulently overlooked or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5009.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5010.539s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think it'll be interesting if we can get a report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5014.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to see where what we've done with that linkage, even doesn't have to go back 30 years, but even just the last four years, while the mayor has been in office, what have we done with our with the linkage?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5026.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that has been coming in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5027.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That'd be interesting to see, because that'll also help us with the data as we're moving forward, because I know that Councilor Bears mentioned a few times of the city not being funded properly, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5036.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We all know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5038.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But these are the avenues that we could possibly look at to say, well, there's a way that we can fund this, or there's a way we can fund that, other than a proposition to an F override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5047.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if I can, as part of this resolution, just to maybe getting a report back from the mayor's office,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5056.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to see what we've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5058.264s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It doesn't have to be extensive, but what we've used the linkage money for over the last four years, that'd be interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5177.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5178.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that now being the new president, Mr, uh, Mr. Beard, uh, Council President Beards, I think ultimately the council president, I think every year don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5189.917s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Isn't that part of your duty?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5190.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, to approve the linkage?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5203.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I'm sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5203.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I but I'm saying maybe that that'll help to to understand, because here's the thing, even though we say one office does it, the truth of the matter is, at least<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5214.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when I've been directly involved with linkage, in discussions with prior mayors, the mayor really does it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5220.459s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we all know that, but I think that just getting an understanding of where we are and where we can go with this as another revenue source, I think is very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5231.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate you bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5233.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's a good study to see and just to investigate and then move things forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5238.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5287.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5287.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because it's still broken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5590.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll make a resolution just because I get an update because I know they said the piece was in just to see when that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5596.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to help Mr. Mr. Cassinetti, that's something I'll do for the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6475.541s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6477.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I support going to committee so we can vet this a little bit better, but we're already listening for the parts that we've already identified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6488.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we're already lacking support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6491.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think spreading that a little bit thinner, when we've already looked at other avenues that we can try to find a pool to help with the affordable housing, I think it's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6503.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So but I think until we, I think the reason why I want to see this go to the committee, so we can understand<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6509.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: how that pot has been distributed and what an impact would be if we subtracted it or what kind of impact that would be if we subtracted, you know, certain percentages and how much that percentage would cost and how that would affect, you know, those other pools that already are drastically in need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6532.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would support it going to committee, but that would be my reservation in that meeting, making sure we have that data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6540.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's important, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7905.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One information on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7907.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7908.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those those projects were in land court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7912.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: were stalled for two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7914.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now remember 99% of those projects go to go to court, the city loses, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7920.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what in essence, what happened was, they might have gone, but they left because they were losing a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7927.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And think about it 600 units, having 60 affordable housing units, that would have done a huge<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7951.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Instead, the big planters now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8272.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8272.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the input, but again, this is where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8277.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the piece that scares me when we're talking about all these different funds that we're looking into and understanding when somebody has a shortfall on a Monday of $2.5 million, and then Friday they find it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8292.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In the real world, somebody gets fired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8295.293s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that that's what our colleague mentioned, but I've talked to other school members that said, when she asked for more clarity, they couldn't give clarity to exactly where the mistakes came from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8315.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They said there were mistakes and they were corrected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8317.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8319.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are they, that was the question, are they corrected?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8321.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How can you show the public, and I love this word, because I hate it if he is, but it keeps ringing true, is transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8329.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How do we honestly look at our constituents, and when, especially during budget time, when the biggest department that we fund in the city lose $2.5 million and then find it in a week?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8344.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that to me is bothersome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8347.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was hoping someone from the school committee would come, the superintendent would be here, but obviously that doesn't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8356.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8358.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, even bringing up last evening, bringing up the dialogue that on the agenda last night in the school committee meeting was the rainy day account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8372.509s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is why I was fighting it so hard the other night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8375.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The rainy day account that the school committee has brought to the attention for the support to the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8384.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The rainy day account that we mentioned here, if a roof falls in, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8388.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or if there's some kind of natural disaster, we have that funding for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8392.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, no, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8395.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: By putting this resolution out there through the school committee, and from what I gathered in the meeting last night was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8406.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a million dollar shortfall, would that constitute an emergency that the mayor could then tap into that fund to bail her out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8420.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not where that funds in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8423.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're seeing is a gross mismanagement of our finances in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8429.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's why I've talked to council bears about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8432.177s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll say it till I'm blue in the face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8434.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: all of these taxes, all of these overrides, everything we're talking about, until we truly get a control of our fiscal responsibilities and management until we understand that we can trust that person, or the organization, all we keep doing is keep pumping more money to a black hole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8458.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, this isn't the other side of rhetoric.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8460.071s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is it's black and white.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8461.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's right in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8463.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Monday, 2.5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8464.169s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Today, 216,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8468.191s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8471.373s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were some errors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8475.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Define those errors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8477.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because a report just spoken by this council president, it's not good enough for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8484.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For the sake of transparency, for the sake of moving forward with some initiatives that we might need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8490.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hey, I've told people a thousand times,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8492.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe we do have to look at process of taxing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8496.69s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you could show the data and you could show the people that are overseeing our finances are responsible and shown that to us, then we could visit it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8506.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But until we see that, how can we even entertain it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8511.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what I keep saying to my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8513.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A lot of it is very simple common sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8516.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Think about it, in all of your businesses, where you work today, you go in tomorrow and you sit with your team and they say, okay, everybody, we have a $2.5 million deficit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8529.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have to start looking into cuts, we have to figure things out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8532.779s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we come in Friday morning, everybody come sit down, we get donuts and coffee, guess what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8537.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're all set, we found the mistake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8539.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, everybody go back to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8541.289s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8542.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That doesn't give me the warm and fuzzies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8544.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That doesn't give me the confidence that says, hey, let's put in multimillion dollar override and say, hey, go ahead, run with that now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8555.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: until we see that until until we actually have control, or we have an office that gives us the confidence that we say, okay, the numbers now show after everything is calculated, after it's done responsibly, and then transparently put out there and say, well, okay, then this gives us an action that would say this is what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8581.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But why we're not more offended<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8584.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as a council that has to approve a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8587.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our number one priority was what tonight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8589.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For the budget, we had a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8591.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Making sure our schools are level funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8595.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What is level funded?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8597.353s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8600.514s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The school system and the mayor, the president of the school committee has already shown us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8606.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are issues, serious funding issues of checks and balances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8614.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just asked my council colleagues, in the good faith of common sense, sit back tonight and think about what I said realistically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8625.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8626.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't make it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8627.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't one side over the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8629.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is right in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8631.579s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a deficit of 2.5 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8634.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And all of a sudden some words came out and saying, this is where it happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8637.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8639.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not true because here's the best thing about Medford, people like to talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8644.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They don't know where it came from yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8647.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not defined yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8649.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's just that it's found.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8651.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's irresponsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8654.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't appreciate the representatives of the school department not being here when a councilor asks, especially when this council is one vote for that budget, that's either gonna support or deny what's going on there, because here's what I want everybody to understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8669.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When it comes to the budget time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8672.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we're gonna come together and say, hey, we're gonna find a way, we're gonna cut all this, but we're gonna raise the school budget by 10%, and I don't vote for it, I don't want it to be the dialogue to go around that George Scarpelli, the teacher of 15 years, whose family teaches, who dedicated his life for children in education,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8692.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: doesn't want to balance the budget because he doesn't like schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8696.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, what I don't like is irresponsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8699.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't like the lack of transparency, and I don't like the lack of respect for this council, for the person across the hall that chairs their committee, and the people that run that department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8713.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know it's a rant, but it makes me feel good because it's out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8720.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you, thank you, I love my claps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8723.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why I'm here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8727.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Truly, that's, I'm being facetious, but this is how I feel, and I think that, really, sit back and think about it as we move forward to the, probably the most, I do feel for the sympathy for my fellow council that are new to this, it's not gonna be easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8743.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Y'all gonna be torn 15 different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8746.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because no matter where you stand on it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8749.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Telling you right now, the common sense of this right now is we're not being respected or educated in their shortfalls, and we're gonna be blindsided, and guess who they're gonna turn to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8761.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the school committee has done in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8764.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Ask Mr. Rousseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8766.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They publicly blame this council, publicly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8772.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So be careful, because this council's gonna be the one that's gonna have to make these decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8777.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So let's not celebrate what we're hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8780.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's get to the bottom, bottom of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8782.048s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have, we can make responsible decisions come budget time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=8786.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=2627.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, Councilor, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=2628.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just made a smart comment with Councilor Bears about our Medford Square plans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=2635.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I do want to, I think that as we're moving through this process, now that I have the floor for a minute, I think what was important as we've seen, when you see these successful community impacts and sharing, I think that are we going to be putting forward<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=2656.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh, community based meetings where we're going from each area of the community to ask, ask for their input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=2662.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that's something we talked about at the meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=2664.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that that's something that when I talked to constituents and we talked about what they would like to see their, their, uh, community look like, I think it was important that we, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=2677.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we really tried to reach out and have more interactive meetings in their backyards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=2684.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that would be important as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=52.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=54.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=56.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=56.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let me get my notes if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=59.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This past week, City of Method lost a great friend, Joe Rosetti.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=66.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If people that neighbors that know Joe, Joe's family grew up with Ashley's daughter, Ashley, and son, AJ, over in the Wellington area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=75.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, Joe has been a lifelong dedicated coach to so many of our youth football players and just recently came back to our method high school football staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=86.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, uh, Joe battled some, uh, some health issues over the last couple of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=92.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And whether he was, uh, rolled up to the field or home, listen to it, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=99.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: through online watching games, he was so dedicated to our kids and he'd be a great, he's a great loss to our community and just wanted to send condolences to the Rossetti family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=110.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know his wife, Sherry, has always been by his side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=113.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I remember them when I taught at the Osgoode School and they were a pillar of the community and he will surely be missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=166.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=169.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: James Jimmy Burns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=171.613s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Another<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=172.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: another loss for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=175.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Burns was a lifelong Method resident before moving to the Cape after his retirement, and he leaves a family behind that really leaves a hole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=186.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Burns is a member of the Bedford High School Hall of Fame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=190.739s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was a legend basketball coach here at Method High School, coached a lot of our kids or now adults in CYO, and he passed suddenly last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=202.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and we just wanted to share our sympathy and our condolences with the Burns family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=220.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=264.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=366.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=566.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've had some trouble even getting the updates from our actuals from this administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=577.247s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe we were doing pretty well up until right before the election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=583.289s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe June, July, August, we were getting redacted information for our city's budget, but we haven't seen anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=592.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and to establish another fund or give this administration control of more money without the checks and balances that I think we're surely lacking here in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=603.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wouldn't support this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=604.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, you know, the...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=616.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think what frightens me, Mr. President, is the Chief of Staff said herself, she mentioned with the ARPA funding, if we're gonna use this type of funding, the way we manage the ARPA monies or the ESSA monies, we're gonna be in serious trouble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=632.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's like, until we know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=640.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry, I think until we know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=642.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we have a legitimate, transparent financial department that's going to keep this city abreast on all of our financial doings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=652.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it would be a huge error for this council to support it for the fact that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=660.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've seen what happened during the budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=663.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had a financial director that can't tell us what's going on with an actual budget that they gave us last year, saying the numbers weren't correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=672.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have different organizations that are still waiting for their retro funding, saying the software is antiquated, so they can't get that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=682.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to think that we want to give more money somehow to this administration, I think it would be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=689.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it be responsible for this, this, this, this committee do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=694.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would recommend that we table this until we get a further understanding of where we are when it comes to updating this council on our fiscal day to day or our fiscal needs and responsibilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=710.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is another pool of money that if we approve,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=712.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to, you know, it's going to come back to us and we're going to be made the scapegoats for the lack of true transparency in that office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=720.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would move that we table this, Mr. President, that be form of a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=724.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=943.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, Mr. President, Mr. President, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=951.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do what you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=953.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=954.824s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=955.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hey, hey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=960.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hey, listen, listen, this isn't the way, this isn't the way to behave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=966.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=967.796s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=969.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have every right to come to this podium, but please give us the respect that this office deserves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=974.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We want to get to resolutions, but yelling out like that, that's not going to get anything done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=979.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you want to speak, this forum's here for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=981.29s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Come up and speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=982.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I listened, come up and speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=984.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yelling out doesn't help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=985.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It really doesn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=986.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please, it's only going to make this a longer, more miserable, disrespectful process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=991.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're all here for a reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=992.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We want Medford to be as best as it can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=995.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this forum's there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=996.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So just take advantage of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1024.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did Ellie take the batteries?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1608.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, we'll make a motion and we'll do that tonight, but at the end of the evening, but again, we can recommend that the mayor come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1617.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the chief of staff is here in her stead if we have questions for her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1622.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was the business area and the person who presented this on the budget that the issues are right now is, we don't know like most communities have a working budget, you, you understand where the money is being spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1638.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm just saying it's everybody else isn't it something to you know I'm just letting everybody know the issue is this council doesn't see that we don't know either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1646.187s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I actually put the school, I put the superintendent on the, on the docket tonight as a resolution because we're hearing rumors because right now they're just rumors to us that the school budget is in the whole 2.5 million for this year so we don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1660.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these are the issues why I wouldn't vote for this because I think that without understanding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1665.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we can't move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1666.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I also think that we have we have a few new Councilors that weren't here when this process started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1671.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think it would be it would be beneficial for them to sit in a meeting to start this whole process over and understanding what a rainy day account is and what it's used for and how they're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1681.949s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are other ways if there are emergencies to help with different scenarios, but I'm not going to get into that tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1688.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'm saying is I don't support this because we don't know what our fiscal future looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1695.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There is no last year we didn't get we we didn't even know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1698.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't even think we got a written budget after it was passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1703.045s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1703.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We got a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1704.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1704.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we got it right after we passed the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1706.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had nothing to work from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2570.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, I think that that's probably one of the questions that people are fearing, is what's going to constitute an emergency?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2579.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is the fact that there is a shortfall in the budget, that that would constitute an emergency, something that should have been handled through our general funds, that now can come to us to say we can build<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2592.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to bail the city administration out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2595.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We say it's a roof, but what is going to constitute an emergency that this fund can be used for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2601.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that that could be a little enlightening for everybody, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2617.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, this is where this council, we fell in this gap with being put on the spot by the firefighters piece, the civil service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2625.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's making us to be the scapegoat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2626.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're gonna say, let's do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2629.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then there's gonna be a huge shortfall because they're gonna cut teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2633.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2634.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then they're gonna come to the podium, look at us and say, now you voted down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2640.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or something that's an emergency in the city because they didn't fund it correctly, they're gonna come to this council and say, okay, you voted for the stabilization fund, now you're gonna have to vote on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2651.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Don't let it get to that point, that's what I'm telling you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2654.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know if you see this, but we're being made to be the scapegoat for her mistakes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2658.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So just be careful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2661.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, let her do it, but not from this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3337.474s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just, thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3339.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want to come full circle, just to understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3341.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The comments that I made earlier, I think that it's out of frustration and understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3347.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we're moving forward with initiatives that are coming forward through this council, and there are people that are questioning those initiatives, I think the biggest issue why this has blown up so much is the understanding that the questions that we all have,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3363.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it that we don't have enough money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3366.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that we're not funding it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3367.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or is it that it's just being mismanaged?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3370.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because that that is the ultimate question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3372.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been part of this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3374.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been part of this council for years now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3377.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With the former mayor and the former financial director, we saw everything we watched things happen live right in front of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3385.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we knew to prepare as we went forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3387.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with, with this administration, we haven't had that luxury.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3391.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these are the issues that I feel to go full circle, like I said, this isn't to attack anybody, this isn't to say that this, this fund wouldn't be good, it wouldn't be good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3401.304s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The fact that it's not transparent, and we don't truly know what the fiscal climate is, and where we stand, we just heard a school committee member<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3410.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Has anyone talked to you about a $2.5 million deficit in the schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3414.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because no one has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3415.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one's told me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3416.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But where does it have to come from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3418.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It has to come back to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3419.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the mayor is going to come back to us and ask us, where are we going to approve this money, everyone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3424.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Where last year at the budget, we warned her, we begged her, please do not use these funds this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3431.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The ARPA funding, we looked about why is our infrastructure so bad?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3434.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you realize that neighbor communities use millions and millions of dollars for what that was intended for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3439.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that was for infrastructure needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3441.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're seeing in our community, it's need to fill the gap in the ordinary budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3447.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now it's left us in big trouble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3449.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So all I'm saying is, as we're moving forward,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3452.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whether this is good or whether it's bad, whether we're voting for one thing, whether we're voting for another thing, understand something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3458.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have an accurate picture to make a sound decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3463.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's common sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3464.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all the full circle I wanted to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3466.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing against anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3467.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't personal, but this is very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3470.98s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know what's going on in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3472.761s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one's seen anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3474.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3474.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one's talked to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3475.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What was the last?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3476.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have you met the financial director?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3478.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have they come up to give us a report?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3479.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Has anybody said anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3480.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3482.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know, but we know we're gonna be meeting and we know what's gonna be said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3486.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna be in fiscal crisis in a few months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3490.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if someone says to me, it's because we don't tax enough or we don't give enough money, we don't know that because our administration isn't transparent enough for educate us in the community to say, this is why we have a shortfall and this is why we need a tax or this is why we need that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3510.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, careful with that window.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3513.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't wanna beat a dead horse, but I'm just saying, these are just common sense issues that I'm bringing up to understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3520.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't truly know if this is a structural issue, if this is a mismanagement issue, or this is a lack of collecting issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3528.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know because we're not educated and we're not given the tools to succeed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3533.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's why I think it's a slippery slope for this council to keep moving forward initiatives and truly not understanding our fiscal picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3541.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3659.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3805.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6691.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7336.814s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7337.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the dialogue, but I think that what my fellow Councilors have to understand, even though it was a few weeks, I think you have to understand the concerns that homeowners have in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7352.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've talked about the CPA and the 1.5% of our tax money going to affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7362.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've identified that we're really not using that properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7367.805s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've talked about issues that I want you aware of so we can understand that this just isn't about a 2% tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7375.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In the last few weeks, we've heard the CPA tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7379.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've talked about this 2% tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7381.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've talked about rent control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7383.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's rumblings about a proposition to an app override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7387.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Talks about a $2.250 million new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7391.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are identified initiatives that my colleagues have brought forward one time or another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7396.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's not just one little issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7399.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're not talking about one issue that's riling up the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7402.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a combination of a bunch of different issues that are affecting who?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7407.949s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Homeowners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7414.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We mentioned, again, I revert back to the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7418.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talk about not having enough affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7422.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, this administration themselves stopped three 40B projects that would assist us in creating more housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7436.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We keep mentioning the highest, only the highest earners, only the highest homes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7441.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I'm going to give you an example because I don't think anybody else in this council has this perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7446.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I own a home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7447.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have a father.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7452.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: just to put it in perspective, I have I have I have a home that I purchased.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7458.539s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have my dad who came to this country, worked very hard to purchase his home, a two family home on Paris Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7466.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He killed himself that home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7468.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He built that home and now that home is worth $1.2 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7472.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what's offensive and what's bothering the community is to think that why should a penny of those people's hard-earned money go to any tax?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7496.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm just putting this all in context because this is being, this is being portrayed as, this isn't, this is just something to just touch base on and go after and just talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7509.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that's dividing this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7512.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Another piece dividing our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7514.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We keep talking about affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7516.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talk about a few different issues that I agree with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7519.362s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we need these, these homes need help, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7521.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These homeowners, excuse me, these renters that live in these condos that are being moved out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7527.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We understand that, but unfortunately, that's what happens when things prosper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7532.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what happens when you live near Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7534.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now taking it and throwing away the baby with the baby water, it's just hurting our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7539.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that there are ways that we can do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7542.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I'm gonna revert back to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7545.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're talking about an affordable trust fund, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7549.041s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A trust that we talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7551.582s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Affordable housing trust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7552.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Housing trust, correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7553.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7554.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it even in place yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7557.202s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, we voted for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7558.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it in place yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7560.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not a place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7561.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's no committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7562.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They haven't done anything yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7569.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it in place yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7570.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, to even talk about it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7572.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's premature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7576.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's disrespectful, this community, to say, okay, this is what they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7581.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's not just 2%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7584.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a dialogue that's spinning around the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7587.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the community, you know, it's funny, I appreciate people coming out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7591.574s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate, I'm gonna say this again, but where were you in November?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7596.316s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because this didn't just sneak up on you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7599.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I am gonna tell you, I respect all my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7603.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I respect everybody behind the reel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7605.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To run for an office is very difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7608.209s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, as you can see, our politics don't align with some of my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7615.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's why when it comes to November, you have to understand these are the impacts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7619.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I understand we have residents that wanna rush things through, I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7624.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But there's more involved in our community, just this one issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7627.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is just the tip of the iceberg.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7629.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we talk about a 2% tax, we still haven't defined the 1.5% of tax that goes to the CPA and how it hasn't been used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7640.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We also haven't talked about the 40B projects that the mayor has stalled to help with that affordable housing issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7648.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have a trust that's not actually in play yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7654.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we've heard comments over and over again talking about how we're pricing out the working class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7664.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who do you think owns these homes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7665.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the working class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7673.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm lucky, I'm lucky that when I said to my dad, I said, I want to move to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7680.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I've heard this from some of my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7682.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he said, and I said, this isn't fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7684.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have a degree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7686.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I went to college, I should be able to afford a house, but I can't afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7689.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know what he told me to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7690.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He looked me straight in the eye and says, well, one job doesn't do it, go get three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7693.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's what I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7698.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my home, my home that was purchased at 220,000 is probably appraised at 800,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7703.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not ashamed to say it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7705.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm proud to say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7707.621s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But everybody has this opportunity to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7711.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You just have to go to work and do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7719.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the dialogue, the dialogue that's being spun that we can we can mold this to whatever we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7724.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's it's really, really disingenuous, because it's exactly who you're hurting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7731.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the homeowners or hardworking people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7733.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've heard more from renters that have called me says please, with all these initiatives, don't do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7739.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I love my landlord.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7741.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Most landlords are great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7742.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we have bad landlords.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7744.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But you're lumping everybody into this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7746.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you're going to destroy this community, whether it's rent control, whether it's taxing, whether it's whether it's an override, whether it's whatever it is, we're killing our homeowners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7758.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7761.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know this is terrible, because now what's going to be spent tomorrow on social media?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7766.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Scarpelli hates renters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7769.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hate, I'll be honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7771.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been fortunate enough to have in my father's home on Paris Street, to have five renters since we bought the house back in 1972.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7780.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And out of those five renters, because of a good landlord, like my brother and my father,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7787.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Four of those people have gone on to purchase homes in Medford because they work with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7796.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The other thing is, I've heard this tonight too, that of course the real estate associations are pushing this all because the real estate has nothing to do with the true homeowners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7805.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if you look out in the audience and we do have real estate, a bunch of real estate agents, but the common denominator with those real estate agents are, they all live in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7815.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and at least for the most part have lived in Medford and that I've talked to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7821.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the whole idea is, the whole understanding that they're getting 7% on purchasing, that's why they're doing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7828.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, really, the homeowners are getting nervous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7832.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're saying, holy cow, I'm gonna sell my house now, or I'm gonna raise my rent to $5,000, because if it does go to rent control, I wanna be ahead of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7841.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the fear that we're causing here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7843.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know if you guys understand this, because maybe you haven't lived in a home or run a home in Medford and understand the true impact, but it's dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7852.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So like I said, there's a lot of movement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7856.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll read some comments from residents that have reached out to me to ask me to read things that couldn't be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7864.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll do that later, because I know there are a lot of people that wanna talk, but we have to understand something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7868.681s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't just an issue that's gonna go to subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7871.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or go to a committee or where we can maneuver.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7874.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have to understand there's a huge fear in this community from renters and homeowners that what we're trying to do, what we're proposing to do is going to change their lives dramatically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7886.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just want you aware of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7888.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=10618.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and how to fund that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=10619.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whether it's taxing homeowners, whether it's a $250 $250 million school and how to fund that, whether it's rent control, whether it's this tax, whether it's whether it's a proposition to an app override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=10632.661s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was my comments of why this issue has been so electrifying in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=10639.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=10640.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But obviously, I also want to say two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=10643.164s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a this isn't a method is in a town.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=10646.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=10647.705s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want everybody got to fix that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=10649.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because we hear that too much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=10651.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And method is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=10654.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=10655.747s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12064.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Alex.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12067.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12068.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can, you're doing a great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12070.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm so proud of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12071.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's get through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12072.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12074.981s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Next, name and address the record at the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18285.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information that counts as a Councilor Scarborough brought up some good points and I appreciate that I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18291.311s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this council also has to understand this dialogue being said that someone threw out bad information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18297.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm gonna be honest with you, the feedback that I got back from people was the fact that we had a meeting with one of our subcommittees that's also been put forth to me that's very confusing to people to what they were used to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18314.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the document that you have in place<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18317.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is very, it could be very cumbersome for just the average person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18322.553s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not everybody is involved in government and understands this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18326.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think I mentioned that to have something where it really highlights what the old subcommittees were and how we're tying them in, we didn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18338.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, but not from what I was told, but I'll go over that with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18341.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the other concerning is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18345.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What started this off was the whole rent control issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18349.571s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The meeting was called for home rule petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18354.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what it was called for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18356.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Two hours before the meeting, information went out about a litany of rent control issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18362.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is compounded with that the comment was put out there for 2%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18368.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there was a dialogue out there said 2%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18372.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what happened was you had people that are invested that wanted to get the word out because they don't feel like they're being heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18382.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we have to be realistic that we do a terrible job in really informing our community, terrible job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18391.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even the conversation that we had in subcommittee talking about having a newsletter with our Councilors writing it and saying we could start it, but where does it go to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18402.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It goes to the same has, but the have-nots don't get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18406.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I said, it's the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18408.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have to find a mechanism that hits everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18411.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have a newspaper, so we don't have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18413.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But that's why these issues get brought into this atmosphere and why so many people are so contentious because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18422.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they're hearing it as something attacking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18431.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18431.507s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know I know that just so just like you said, I know that there is a group that they're having a kickoff event on May 2, and it's for all method<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18442.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is a group of residents organizing to keep Medford informed about important issues that affect your housing as well as the issues that affect your quality of life here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18453.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I applaud that grassroots organization because I think that's what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18457.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's welcome to everybody from what I've told, and just come on in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18459.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And even if you get your name on an email, maybe that's how we start that conversation that we talked about at subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18845.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just love saying no to me by the way that's a no time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18848.574s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm counting, I get a radio.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18850.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18922.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is from,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18924.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is from residences dear method city council, I'm unable to make tonight's meeting live or on zoom due to conflict, I want to express my thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18934.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: on tonight's real estate tax proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18936.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand the issue of affordable housing and the need to address this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18940.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe tonight's meeting will raise more awareness to our affordable housing needs in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18945.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I for one will certainly pay more attention to this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18948.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm a lifetime resident of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18950.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I raised my family here and went to Medford public schools and have contributed to the community in many ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18956.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In fact, that's what I'm doing tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18959.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think what's missing in this whole issue is the fact that there are thousands of different scenarios that homeowners have been planning for sales of their homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18967.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Many people I know are thinking of their home as an asset for retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18971.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we all know the cost of living and the cost of health care in this area are tremendously expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18977.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Some have leveraged their homes values to offset the college education of the children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18982.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Others were hit with illness and sent them in a different direction in life and thus the need for this asset is paramount to living a normal life in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18991.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know this from experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18993.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Most of us are not real estate moguls looking to make a fast buck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18997.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're citizens who have worked hard our whole lives in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19002.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We deserve the right to use the sale of our home to make the right decisions for our families and our future in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19008.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please do not derail the thousands of plans citizens have laid out for themselves by now blindsiding them with another tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19017.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's Jim McCarthy, 37 Blakely Road in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19021.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19546.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19549.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I think that this is a very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19553.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a hot topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19554.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that one thing that I would recommend is as we move forward with our committee meetings, I know that we have in the past been a little free and adding information before the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19568.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it'd be important that we try to figure out what the president and our leadership team, that as we move forward, when we send out these topics, when you talk like use the rent control issue,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19579.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that the information gets out there so residents can see that, because I think that's one of the things that played into this evening was the fact that that issue was so big, and that information wasn't really put out that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19593.368s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was put out as home rule petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19595.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now legally that's the way they've done, but in all sincerity, it's, it's that starts the divide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19602.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that whether we change our way of business, Mr. President, and how we allow ourselves to present information for certain meetings, I think that's something we should revisit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19617.486s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But a question that I had was, we keep skipping over a step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19622.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody keeps saying here, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19624.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we go to the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19625.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's one person we're not talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19628.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What is the mayor saying about these issues?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19632.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Has anyone talked to the mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19634.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because this is funny, what I see that it's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19638.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the most important person suppose in our community, our leader.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19642.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we have yet to hear from her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19645.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's very busy fighting right fights, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19648.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, postponing meetings for two months, we'll get into that another day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19651.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the mayor hasn't been transparent in anything we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19657.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One of the issues we hear right now is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19660.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why so late was because something might have been very simple, really turned into a snowball effect to the fact that we truly don't know what our budget looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19671.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know you have the resolution coming up this evening, and I had, I would have motions going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19677.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know if we're going to get to it, truly don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19679.187s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the truth of the matter is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19682.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to know where the mayor stands with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19684.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So whether it's passed or not, I'd like to, as an addition or a separate motion, that the mayor is involved in these meetings and her administration to help us if this moves forward to craft something that's reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=21040.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=21100.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=21164.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=21307.796s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=855.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: really tried to focus on for our many years and going through this process is understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=862.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First things first is looking at what I would request and what it really meant to our budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=870.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and I think that there's a tone to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=873.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: City Solicitor, Assistant City Solicitor, I was going to talk about, I'm glad Councilor Collins brought up the fact, Vice President Collins brought up the fact that the reason that we're not filling that position is, you know, the dialogue out there is when you're offering a position that important, it should be given that respect when it comes to pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=897.548s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=899.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when you keep it at that price, and like I've told you in the past, everybody here, that I've talked to city solicitors that I've worked with in the past, and this is, you know, their observation is that you only can apply for a job and be a city solicitor if the mayor truly wants a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=918.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think she's very comfortable, KP Law, I think she controls the dialogue, and as KP Law says, they don't work for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=926.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A city solicitor now works for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=928.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the reason why I think that's so important, I'll say it over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=933.692s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We did a huge disservice for the residents of the BJ's neighborhood because we answered questions without having legal representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=943.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it cost us by putting in a gas station that we could say now they're doing it that we don't need there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=950.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's for a huge company that has a lot of money that has done nothing to prosper relationship with the neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=959.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=959.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even even after they've come in and talk to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=962.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's still a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=963.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They still have not fulfilled what they've wanted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=965.92s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They should have done so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=967.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Having the funded positions to what it deserves to be, and I'm glad Council Collins shared those numbers because I had the similar numbers from, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=978.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That city<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=983.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you could see that, and I think that that's a huge cost savings, both with not bringing KP law for hourly rate and something that they really don't assist us with, and the fact that having someone that heads off huge issues, like I mentioned earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1002.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The DPW cement and hot top crew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1004.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something, I think it's now, it's sort of,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1009.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: comedic now when I bring it up because I've been doing this since we started I when I first when it was my first year as a Councilor was gung ho about this and I got a report and I did a I did a study and I came to I brought I brought the paperwork into the to the administration and it was a crew of three with their salaries and their benefits and their one time cost for the truck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1033.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it came out to maybe like $250,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1035.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it was voted down, it wasn't even obtained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1040.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But since then, every year, we are asked to pull a bond for cement sidewalks for 2.5 million to 500,000 per million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1050.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I can guarantee you we're going to get that again this year, the mayor will come to us and ask us for a bond for sidewalk repaving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1057.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1059.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: where you can have your own crew come in and do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1062.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when times are slow, which they wouldn't be because we have so many issues, you can also use that crew to backfill, whether it's a spring to help the fields crew get that facility ready, whether it's highway, if we need something with highway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1078.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's probably one of the most underfunded, under positioned<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1086.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: departments in our city, both DPW, and as you all know, with the fire department being down 25 firefighters, you're looking at under funding and undermining our most vital positions, and that's hurting us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1101.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's why I bring that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1103.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the other, the administration for recreation department, so I would get a few phone calls, because I don't know, some of you might know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1114.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I chaired and spearheaded the full time recreation department here in Medford a few years back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1120.681s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And Mayor Burke gave me the opportunity to chair it and really be the voice and share my professional opinion and we really watch it grow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1132.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think Kevin Bailey and his team, they do an amazing job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1136.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But now we're at the point where there's growth, we have to keep moving forward now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1141.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we're starting to get stagnant and we're starting to waste money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1144.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll give you an example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1145.609s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you have a director that's making, you know, maybe 90s, and he's spending 15 hours, 20 hours a week, answering phones, making phone calls, replying to emails, because they don't have a even a part time administrative assistant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1165.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are the things that you see that are hurting us, and they're cost effective, and no by no means.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1171.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you look at the situation where we when we talk about elections they say well funding the elections department is difficult because it's only really during election season we really need those people so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1182.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want the administration if they can is to be a little creative and looking at a position where you have someone that's working in the recreation office, maybe 20 hours a week, or maybe 30 hours and 10 hours in the slow times in elections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1196.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then that flips during election time, they work 30 hours in elections and work 10 hours at recreation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1202.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that that would be more cost effective when you're talking about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1206.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: your director or your assistant director answering phone calls that that you really should have someone that's, you know, there all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1214.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The other pieces of people saying that we don't have someone that's answering the phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1218.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So parents would call even during the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1221.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, as a recreation department, you want somebody at that phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1224.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You might have an issue with, a parent might've forgot that, they forgot to tell us their child is allergic to bananas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1231.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when you don't have a person you can talk to, and you can't get ahold of that person that's in the field, it's a scary time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1238.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know it's dramatic, but these are the things that we think of when we work with children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1242.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's why I look at that position, seeing how important that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1248.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The other position is looking at increasing program, another program coordinator that focuses on after school care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1256.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I can tell you as, as my profession, we see the benefits financially and for our community, when you can offer<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1267.532s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a robust program through your recreation department, where parents aren't afraid to spend money to make sure their kids are in a highly developed program like the recreation respected program like recreation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1281.079s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that also supports the issues we're having in the school department, that you've all heard it, you've all gotten phone calls that there's no after school care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1290.164s">[Scarpelli]</a>: one school's full, so there's a waiting list, they'll never get in, and then as they try to get on the next season, they can't do it, so it's just a revolving issue that, for the most part, who it really affects is the most needy in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1305.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not the more affluent members of our community that understand on April 1st, registration's gonna open, they're gonna be there right on their computer, boom, boom, boom, they're gonna sign up with their credit cards, and what happens,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1316.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have families that don't have that access, maybe not to a computer, not to even have a credit card.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1324.289s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it makes it difficult to make sure there's equity there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1327.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that having that position would really help when it comes to the overflow and looking at what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1334.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that we work closely with the YMCA with their afterschool care, and they take a lot of the voucher kids in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1341.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but there's still a huge need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1343.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you love the fact that our parents that have a voice are being heard and the Brooks and the Roberts and the McGlynn and they're being heard and they're figuring out ways like being creative and starting bringing in Mr. Karate and paying Mr. Karate $150 for an after school program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1361.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That sounds great for the parent that has the means.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1365.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when we talk about kids that don't that when they're locked out of the YMCA program, because the numbers, these are things that I feel that are important in our budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1375.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Next is staffing and education for the elections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1379.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm hearing some pretty disturbing things in the streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1383.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not only from this, you know, last election, still things are lingering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1388.148s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And a lot has to do with probably the greatest people in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1392.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And those are the people that are working the polls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1395.763s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when you're talking about, I know most of them, and they're the sweetest people in the world, but unfortunately, I don't think we spend enough money and time in making sure they're trained properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1406.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then that does what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1408.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because perception is reality, that then puts them in a bad position because they weren't taught the right way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1414.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And a resident that is educated when it comes to this, they blow things totally through the roof and who gets affected and then who walks away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1423.494s">[Scarpelli]</a>: are those people that come in and do that work for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1425.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know a little winded, but I wanted to make sure that there was a dialogue and there was a reasoning for my choices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1432.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're also, you know, I know that Councilor Villes, we all want the schools at least level funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1440.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: From what I heard today that the teachers, union representatives reached out to me today and they were told that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1447.065s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The school system is at a spending freeze right now, and they're still trying to make up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1452.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that Councilor Bears heard something different, which is better news, but from what I heard last time, it was still $2.5 million that the mayor actually replied and said that's true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1463.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is scary because a lot of it's coming down to the sustainability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1470.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we purchased or we put any money from ARPA or ESSER into any of our programs,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1477.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The reasoning in other communities having that person that oversaw the ARPA money, the first thing that when we met with them as a professional, when you meet with that director, they say, okay, what is the sustainability after that money is done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1490.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was the key.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1491.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we couldn't show sustainability, we couldn't move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1495.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Medford just used it as a stopgap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1497.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now we're gonna be in dire straits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1500.311s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's why having this meeting is great, but we all should realize I'm trying to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1506.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: educate everybody I talk to, you know, and you, my fellow colleagues are just starting off, you're going to see, you're going to get phone calls, emails, people going to stop you in the street, and they're going to blame you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1518.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and people don't understand the budget process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1523.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can ask what we're doing right now, but when it comes down to the budget, all we can do is cut, we can't add.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1529.494s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm just trying to educate people with that, just so they know, because it is going to be, I hope I'm wrong, I pray to God I'm wrong, but it doesn't look good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1539.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But thank you very much, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1541.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I owe you 66 minutes for talking, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=1545.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, you're good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2864.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2865.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scrivilli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2866.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2866.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, I appreciate Council Bears and our new Council at least starting this process, but, you know, for my newer colleagues, it's nice that there was a time when we used to get<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2881.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We used to get updates on a pretty regular basis, making sure that we were all caught up and understood what was going on in the day-to-day budgets here in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2891.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So even the actuals that we're getting from our Chief of Staff, it's kind of sparse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2896.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, we were receiving them until last one we received was August.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2903.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and they're redacted, so you really can't see much, but at least we got something from the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2908.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The fact that I think that I might disagree with Council Vice President Collins, the software that former financial director Aleesha Nunley had is the same software that we have today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2924.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: she would give us a robust breakdown of our finances and preparing us for the upcoming budget, especially for the last few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2935.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This has been horrific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2936.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that we're celebrating starting in March because the truth of the matter is, I believe two years ago, we didn't even actually get a actual budget book, we didn't even receive one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2950.453s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And neighboring communities<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2953.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this process, working in municipality, I see things a little differently, because I'm part of that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2959.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We started, we started six weeks ago with our process in our department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2965.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're already starting the pre budget meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2969.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're actually getting updates from our finance office that gives us our budgets updated on a monthly basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2978.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we know where we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2979.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2983.427s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's pretty impressive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2984.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we don't see here is there is a lack of transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2988.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor ran on transparency, but we're seeing a drastic opposite of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2993.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There is really no transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2995.477s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The software is there at least to keep us apprised of what's going on, but it's sparse at best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3004.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like I told you, this is something we've asked for for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3006.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, we're two years behind and we started getting redacted actuals in June, July, then August, and we haven't seen anything since, unless my colleagues can say otherwise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3019.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The last one I got was August.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3021.466s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3021.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The Warren articles, the redacted Warren articles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3024.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we haven't seen anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3025.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that, you know, Councilor Bears brings up a great point that, you know, not having,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3031.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: funds really paying a huge impact and the issues we're seeing today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3036.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What are we talking about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3037.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What has been the biggest news lately?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3039.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The biggest news lately is what's going on with the firefighters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3042.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's funny, so what I did is I didn't just go to our fire department, I went to neighboring fire departments in the greater Boston area and I talked to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3050.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they talked to the fire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3051.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I talked to deputy chief in Boston, and he broke down their process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3056.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I talked to a deputy chief from Cambridge and in Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3060.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I've asked them, the biggest thing I see right here that's glaring, and you know, the overtime issue or the absentee issue wouldn't be an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3071.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If our fire department is funded with 125 people that's supposed to, because they built in for absences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3080.274s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I asked questions that looked into some opportunities that hopefully we'll know soon that we'll see that our firefighters don't take sick days fraudulently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3098.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They earn those days and they take those days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3100.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think we'll see one firefighter in the red.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3103.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think other departments in the city or other neighboring fire departments will have the same news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3113.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we're seeing the impact of our budget causing some serious divide in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3120.209s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, you've all seen it, that everybody's pointing fingers at us and everybody's pointing fingers at this person, everybody's pointing fingers at that person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3129.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if it's funded properly, we wouldn't be in this mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3132.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if we had a team in the finance department that can bring all the information forward that's needed, like neighboring communities, because I'll give you, I can only speak for myself, but I'm in a municipality where we were in the rez for three years in our contracts, and we finally settled up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3151.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It took two weeks to get the retro updated and then paid out to all the employees, and that was hundreds of employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3159.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have the same software here, but for some reason, it's causing a huge, huge issue why the fire department hasn't gone near retro because I personally think either we don't have the money or we don't have the staffing that can do the job that's needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3177.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is why it's important to understand the processes as we're moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3182.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're gonna be, I'll say it a thousand times,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3187.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the lack of growth and the lack of new money in the last four years, we're reaping the negative ramifications today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3199.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There hasn't been a shovel in the ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3201.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have major areas in our community that could be redeveloped into mixed use smart growth and development processes that will bring in millions and millions just in permit fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3214.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: know, we talked about one of the projects that was that walked away from the city on Boston Ave, that just the permit fees alone was $6 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3226.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That would help any deficit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3228.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3230.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, so there is so much that I see that wasted, wasted funds, wasted money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3237.794s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, you know, I pray like Councilor Callahan says that we realized how important those ARPA positions were, both on the school side and the city side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3250.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're seeing what's happening because, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3254.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I we love Penelope, and she's changed that department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3258.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One person she came in, she was a one person army here, when method was going through a huge drug issue, suicide issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3265.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And she did amazing things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3267.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't think we celebrate that enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3270.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if you talk to recovering addicts that live in our community, young people that I know, and I taught, they tell me that that office saved their lives and actually gave them a purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3280.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then our advocates for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3283.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3284.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because that's what I was told, that's an ARPA position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3288.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think the fear of losing her job now that she's a young mom and have a family, she, she needs that sustainability and, and now she's gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3299.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, um, so I think that we're in a position right now that, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3305.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: looking at creative way of funds funding is something that's needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3311.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate everybody sharing their their goals and I think that someone that's the senior member now, is that the first time I said that Kit?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3321.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm the senior member now and I've sat through a lot of these both on the 16 years now on the school side of the school committee member now a city council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3330.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've never seen anything like we've seen in the last couple of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3336.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Last year was a very contentious budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3340.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, we were angry with our colleagues and it kind of divided us in a sense because of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3348.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm happy that Councilor Biaz has gone early with our vice president and talked with the mayor and started this process openly so it's not something that's being done on the 12th hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3360.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, just so we can get something through so we can move on with our lives here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3365.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=440.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can I just chime in, Madam President, if I can?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=441.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=442.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, and I understand why we're doing this, but I think that some of the confusion's coming in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=446.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you could shed some light, I know that that Section 31, Chapter 186 of Mass General Law, that all landlords must deliver an accompanying form when issuing a notice of quit for nonpayment<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=460.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: of rent and residential tenants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=462.272s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think, so the confusion is that I believe, are we saying in context that we're not seeing that happen and we want to make sure that we're doing our part as a city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=474.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or because there's already, what I've been told is that the state law is already in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=481.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's a required notice to quit an accompanying form that the landlords must provide a form of notice to quit as of April 1, 2023.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=491.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's when it was implemented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=493.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The landlords that issue notice to quit for non-payment of rent to a residential tenant must also give a tenant<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=501.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a completed accompaniment form that details information on rental assistance programs, applicable trial court rules, standing orders, emergencies, so on and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=511.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I could just keep on going, but as the questions that I received were that if this is already in place in the state,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=520.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, what I don't see is it is these forms in multi language languages that we're offering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=526.34s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think it's important to hear that is, are we doing this in conjunction with the state law to make sure that we're going above and beyond as a council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=537.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's the question that landlords are asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=539.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're already doing this by state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=543.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we doing something we're not supposed to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=544.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or is this something now we can do the metric ordinance instead of the state ordinance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=549.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think just getting that clarification would be good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=709.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When a state law is in place, and we have, I understand the fact that we're putting in an ordinance to beef that up, but when it goes to a judge, would they look, they wouldn't look at what we're implementing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=726.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Does it hold muster if it goes to a court?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=730.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: like with the state ruling or what the state's asking and then what we're asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=745.065s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, if it goes to court, is it a binding law that it would be using it as either defense or, you know, you're battling it goes to a court for eviction?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=757.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, what a judge, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=759.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Look at that as a binding bind?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=761.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it binding in the eyes of the court?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1461.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1463.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1465.407s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Similar similar questions my colleagues brought up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1467.268s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that it's funny when we see some of the biggest issues we have is the policing and the notification and who's doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1475.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, you know, it falls back in an office that's undermanned and overworked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1481.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that that's that's I think that's the, the, the concern is making sure the word gets out so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1489.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: thinking, you know, I know that landlords don't always oversee their properties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1494.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you look at real estate agents, and we have, we have a lot of great real estate agents that are responsible, and maybe finding a way to marry them to also share that information to share to their tenants if that's their will, or is it just something that goes right to the homeowner, and it leaves it up to them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1515.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think right now the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1517.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the biggest issue is that I see it's the intent is awesome, getting it out there, making sure that people are informed in this, you know, so one of the questions what is, is a redundant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1529.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, it isn't redundant, because the state law looks at one thing, but we're looking at multiple factors that pay into a landlord.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1538.969s">[Scarpelli]</a>: tenant agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1540.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, I, I was fortunate that I had, we had the best landlord in my life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1545.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that was my dad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1546.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he had, we had landlord, we were, we had renters that lived with us for 15 years, and bought their home, another 15 years, bought a home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1558.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now my dad's been gone seven years, the tenants that are still there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1562.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they've been there for about 12 years now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1564.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's a lot to say about a good landlord tenant relationship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1569.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, but I think that the biggest thing is really going to be that I want to focus on as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1575.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is really now bringing in the building department saying, how are we going to do this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1580.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, it's, it's, like you said, Alicia had it all right here, you know, the tax bill, you know, I,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1585.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the water bill is right because I don't pay the water anymore I go right online and do it so I wouldn't get that information so I think that these are the these are the big issues as we're vetting that's what we have in these meetings that people have to understand because I know that the the intent that people thought this meeting was for is we're going to do rent control again and uh I said so this is once again not that meeting I appreciate Vice President Collins clarifying that and and everybody understanding that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1611.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a journey that we still have to vet out some very important pieces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1615.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I think we look at the situation we had last year, it gives us an avenue to support our renters and our landlords.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1625.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they're prepared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1626.035s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1996.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we're moving in the right direction, but I think that we keep this in the committee and actually call for a meeting with the building department and try to see once we gather more information with what our office of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=2012.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: planning is doing, and we can, like we said, these meetings are great, and what they're intended for is to vet these processes out where, you know, you get phone calls as a Councilor Tseng, we're doing something today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=2027.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's like, no, understand there's a process, and these small processes hopefully get us to a resolution where everybody looks at the final product and say, this is how it benefits everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=2037.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: no one's out to get anyone this isn't a conspiracy theory this is something that's hopefully going to work so i think that the biggest question right now is how we how we get the information out and then um in the building department how we're going to oversee that uh this that's that piece of it so so i would recommend we move with that as a as a motion thank you councillor scarpelli<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=988.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=989.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope everybody rested up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=992.236s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I got to bed at five in the morning this morning, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=996.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just wanted to share some comments from some of the residents and the negative impacts that they're gonna be feeling with their landscape companies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1011.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Most of the people that have reached out did stress that they are senior citizens that do have homes that need to be taken care of and at the same time are on a fixed budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1022.805s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this will affect people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1024.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that there are some benefits that when you look at implementing this type of an ordinance, when you look at environmental measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1035.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I still haven't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1037.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been researching this and I still haven't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1041.928s">[Scarpelli]</a>: received something that I feel comfortable about is what will happen to the batteries after use because from what we're what I'm what I'm investigating in neighboring communities that are doing this the biggest question is the effect in the environment when we have to destroy or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1066.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: bury these batteries and what impact it'll make on our environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1070.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there are still a lot of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1072.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, the other piece that, you know, everybody, some people make comments tonight that, geez, I'm glad to hear that the municipal side, we're going to be fading into something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1086.289s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know, do you understand that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1090.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The average cost is between two to four million dollars for a municipality to retrofit DPW trucks for charging stations and then replacement of these batteries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1107.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are studies that were done just in our neighboring community that they pushed it through anyway, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1112.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our neighboring community has a lot of money to, I believe I was told it was $3 million to retrofit their vehicles and phase in all of these new leaf blowers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1124.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know we have until 2028, but I tell you what, I don't see a very good outlook for our future finances in Medford with still no development and no actual<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1141.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh, responsible fiscal responsibility that's being maintained by administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1146.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these are things that I find still, um, a little concerning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1151.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Another piece that I, I received was that, you know, I, I, I'm not there right now, but I'm assuming there's at least one landscaper that's been in the city for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1160.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would assume he's there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1162.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, but for the most part, our landscapers aren't really coming out and, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1169.73s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, they're disgusted in the fact that they're just going to move away from Medford and the impact that this is playing on their part because, you know, they use they use leaf blowers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1179.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, that's that's how they get through power through and make sure that they can keep homes affordable when you use a landscaper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1187.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1190.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have a home, I'm going to use my electric blower, but I do it for what's needed and move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1198.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I just think there's a lot of variables.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1202.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it sounds easy, and it's great to check off a box that we want to put in this ordinance, that it supports the environment, that it's really going<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1218.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, prepare our community later and moving in slowly into the phase out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1222.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But these are, these are difficult times and they're going to be worse in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1228.148s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there's a lot of variables here that I can't support without, without more, um, more work being done to prove to me that this isn't going to be, this is going to be safer for the environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1239.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, I appreciate your time and thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=2955.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I just, I've done a little research on lithium batteries and, you know, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=2963.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There is, you know, a huge, you know, question about them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=2970.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you're talking about lithium batteries and what they contain, the metals and cobalts and nickels and the contaminants, they contaminate water supplies and the ecosystem if they leach out of landfills, because that's how they're truly disposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=2984.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We could drop them off at Home Depot, but then they go to a landfill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=2988.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the biggest thing that we're hearing right now is what Officer McGover did say, is that they do cause a lot of fires.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=2997.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're seeing that more and more as they're demanded more and more in our communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=3009.477s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I did do a little, I did do some homework on the lithium battery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=3012.64s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's something that as I get more involved with understanding, you know, our environmental needs and footprints, I think that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=3025.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The comparison that studies have shown is that we'll see more damage to our environment in the future, in the long run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=3035.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The measurements can't be apples to apples, because this is something that's at its infancy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=3042.981s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you'll see it later in life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=3045.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's what is keeping me from moving forward with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=3050.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the particulates in the air,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=3055.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You could, you know, you could, you could debate that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=3059.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So how it's, how it's blown and how it's managed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=3062.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You look at, you know, putting in some standards in place, people like the cast family, they make sure they are respectful to the community and they're respectful in how they're disposing and using these products.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=3079.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know some aren't, some companies don't do that, but you know, that's more of, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=3085.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, the piece of enforcement, which, um, I know we have, we have our, um, we have our, um, building inspectors and our, our code enforcement inspectors going through their, um, going through their contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=3101.571s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I would recommend that our new director re commissioner reaches out to their, his team and in negotiations, they should really, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=3111.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: enlighten their enforcement officers that this is coming down the line because this isn't going to be easy this to add this to their plate again there's another reason that i find it you know um listen i know i know it's inconvenient for people because some people do take advantage of it and they could be loud but for the most part<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=3133.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, you know, the conversations that I've had with residents, it really, you know, it's, it's, it's, it really doesn't make a difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=3144.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I haven't, I haven't heard a groundswell of changing an ordinance or implementing an ordinance for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=3149.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but again, I, I, I respect my colleagues and, and the, the, the evolution of this process, but, um, um, just wanted to share what, what I've learned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=3160.692s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4238.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4281.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4435.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4439.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=346.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've got 28 people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=380.165s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that will really help us understand this is the portion that goes to true form of power.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=401.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=433.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a good answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=436.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the question is, if it wasn't set up, could there be a certain amount of money expected that this is already an issue, this is already a problem, that we can start feeding this money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=447.016s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is there a figure that we can hold to make sure that, with the question we have right now, the question I'm trying to receive, is the funding that's going off to legal services,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=457.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's truly, you know, there's other avenues for legal services or issues when it comes to housing, but when it comes to helping out homeless or accessibility, it's really just, you know, this would be a great way to bring it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=539.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: those are the three categories a minimum of 10% a year has to go to each of those three and then the remaining is can go to any of those three<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=568.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when we can now have an identified system that's already been set up that we know can get action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=576.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we know that we can actually go and that there's always gonna be at least 10% or maybe more that will support the housing concerns we have in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=586.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate some of these questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=645.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's, thank you for the clarity, I think that's important, so appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=794.159s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=1076.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, if I can, thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=1078.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=1080.29s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what you see the excitement with, when people can see the tangible changes, the upgrades to important pieces like parks and playgrounds, I think it's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=1089.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But do you know a part of this is for accessibility apparatus, so our kids with special needs can have an opportunity to play in all these playgrounds, just the one at the McGlynn, I think the one at Carr Park maybe too, is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=1616.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=1617.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That brings up a good point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=1619.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Miss Cameron, I think that especially this evening, as we vet other issues out the affordable housing give us give us some ideas of some some of the projects that were denied for affordable housing this round.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=1696.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I only bring this up because what the tone we're seeing lately, rent control, the tax question this evening, and Community Preservation Act has funded all of our affordable housing issues so far today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=1712.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=1713.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that that speaks a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=1715.509s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that speaks volumes of what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=1717.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: direction we should really be considering when you talk about affordable housing needs and in how it affects the rest of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=1726.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=1728.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2392.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2393.494s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any further comments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=171.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=5209.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Bowen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=7991.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=11959.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16035.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16165.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had a special permit meeting with Council Member Nygaard there and we discussed the signage for the restaurant that is being built in the Felswick Plaza.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16507.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16618.794s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17305.981s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17861.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=118.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, just for, um, just for edification tonight, uh, Wednesdays have been a very difficult night for me because I also work on Wednesday, some Wednesday nights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=127.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm going to stay in this meeting as long as I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=131.142s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And unfortunately won't be able to attend the seven o'clock meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=134.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just wanted that, um, that to be no night, not, I'm not disrespecting anyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=140.805s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just, uh, unfortunately every other Wednesday, it looks like I've been, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=146.98s">[Scarpelli]</a>: had to work my regular job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=150.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=152.247s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=357.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information if I can, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=365.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I appreciate this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=367.016s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just wanted to share just a couple of questions before we get going that people have reached out and I wanted to share that with this topic being very important, it is also a hot topic button that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=386.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we had some questions on whether the information that we received today from you was enough time for any legal ramification with the open meeting law, what the information is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=401.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then the other one that I needed to share with you, Councilor Collins, that I had residents calling me asking if we can table this portion for the fact that tonight is a holy night and we have a lot of people that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=415.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: couldn't make this meeting at such a short notice once they understood what was involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=421.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So although I feel some of these points are very important in what we saw with the issue that you talked about, I think as a whole this is something that really has to have more of an open dialogue with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=438.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: from beginning to end with all the stakeholders in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=442.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that I just wanted to share that with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=446.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope you can consider that because I think that with such a hot topic issue right now, making sure that we don't alienate or try to divide with this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=460.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=627.236s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, to the Chair,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=636.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=636.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate that Councilor, but I also wanted to make sure it was addressed that we did have, being that even if it is a kicking off point, we do have residents that, you know, looked at what we had, but then the information that was sent out that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=657.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that was shared that it was it's pretty intense and it's pretty like we know it's it's a volatile hot topic button so I think that you know the the understanding that a lot of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=671.209s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are a lot of homeowners that are at 6 o'clock mass tonight for a holy night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=675.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just want to make sure that we address that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=677.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's something that, again, when we talk about this new process, because this is a new process, and how we're doing our subcommittees and different committees, this is new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=687.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think even with me, I was a little confused with the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=691.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And getting the information now that will be outlining something that I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=697.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that people need to know from the jump.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=700.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's my input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=702.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I respect what you're trying to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=706.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know that, but I just wanted to make sure that I was heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=710.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=943.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry, point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=947.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Chair?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=948.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=952.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I hate to interrupt, please forgive me, but as we're going down this road, I think we need to be very careful that we're not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=962.739s">[Scarpelli]</a>: without any legal representation, as we're looking to go further with this, we're not looking at what we say and then coming back to bite us because there are financial ramifications that do affect the community and individuals in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=979.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I, you know, I, you know, I know that I've asked, I just don't, I don't want to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=988.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, go down this hole and then find us in that BJ situation that we, we made a big faux pas and we're, uh, then backpedaling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=998.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would, I would caution to move forward with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1001.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I, you know, I, I, I would second 22 it, but, um, I right now that, that, that, that's coming close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1009.187s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just don't, this is too much in play with this, this, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1015.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that if we're talking about pieces of this that talked about this issue that's brought apart apart, but as we're looking at rent control, that's a whole different, different animal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1027.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is this is something that's going to change this community drastically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1031.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that will affect every homeowner and also what it would look like financially tax purposes as we move forward in in revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1042.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1043.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we need to really understand as we're going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1047.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's like I said, if I received this information, Madam Vice President, early, you know, with some time, I could have vetted this, but I honestly got this, the whole breakdown of what your resolution reads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1061.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: about an hour and a half ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1062.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would ask that we would table this to another date and move on to something else, because I think that this is something that might come back to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1074.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1228.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information to the clerk, please, Mr. Chairperson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1235.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1239.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it wasn't in, what is the ruling on open meeting law regulations with material that wasn't in place just a few hours ago?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1250.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1291.888s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's the question, because I'm getting phone calls and emails from that talk about home repetitions on stabilization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1300.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what I got today was pretty in-depth and pretty lengthy and pretty intense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1308.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's where the slippery slope comes in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1311.293s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But thank you for the clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=730.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=731.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm still a little, I'm still a little confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=734.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Justin, if a council saying, as we're looking at this, we're looking to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=739.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To an essence, sending out a press release that the city has a whole department that does this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=748.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, you know, for one Councilor, I'm not afraid to work, but I have two kids in college.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=753.258s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm working three jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=754.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, you know, to, uh, it just, to me, it's, it's, uh, you know, and adding another meeting and I, you know, I, I completely, you know, understand what you're looking at, but I still, I'm still a little confused of what, what, you know, the goals of the city council that, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=775.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we're sending out separately now do we have all the the other question I would have is the accessibility issue that who is it getting to is it getting just to the people that you know that that have access to to what we have or you know the mayor does<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=793.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Her monthly video, we have a city communications department that we fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=806.231s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My question is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=807.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we doing, is this too redundant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=810.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I think that, um, I don't want to water down messages that it's coming from where, I mean, it's, you know, that's, I have, I have a few concerns with this because I think that, you know, sometimes, sometimes more isn't better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=825.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, the city sometimes doesn't do a great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=830.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or really a good job or actually even a decent job getting out information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=834.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is something where local communities work hand in hand with their communications department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=843.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, you don't, you know, we get<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=847.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We get communications from the city council on a weekly basis through the communications director and the mayor's liaison in Somerville, and that goes out to everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=861.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't want to be redundant, and we don't want to put... Listen, if we put too much out there, sometimes we kind of...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=870.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we kind of bury things that we need, messages we need to send out, and it makes it more difficult for the common citizen, not the person that's there at our meeting every day, not the person that's watching our meetings and chiming in or emailing us all the time, but I think this is something that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=892.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I'm having a difficult time understanding it, I can't imagine our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=898.477s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's my concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=900.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1177.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1179.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this, this is why these meetings are great, I think, because we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1184.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can vet some some issues and concerns of my 2 with those comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1190.191s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I too share those, those concerns, but I think that we have to look at a, trying to find out what that mechanism is going to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1199.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, this council is very limited in what we, what, what we control when it, when it comes to, uh, what outlets we can use through the city, unless we have buy-in with the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1212.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, because I, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1215.842s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even our page, it's not really understood to most constituents, I think, and where to find information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1224.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that poses one problem that I think we have to vet out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1228.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then I think the other piece is, again, we can use what Councilor Lazzaro mentioned with the newsletter that she mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1239.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it's who gets those newsletters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1242.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we have engaged constituents that are involved in the planning and development, or there's an issue in their neighborhood, they're involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1253.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But like you said, there isn't a main<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1259.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: newspaper or or identified uh link that we can use that's going to get out to every resident that's what i'm that's what i'm trying to say when i said that it's is it who who can we reach um you know the the engaged resident they're they're going to see that but what we're seeing is that people that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1284.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that unfortunately aren't engaged, but when they need to be and they can't, they're not tied in with any group or any, um, um, site that, that we're seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1294.69s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we need to find, you know, work with the city and maybe work with the clerk and our president to see what can we do to start or have that type of messaging that's going to go out throughout the community, not, not specific, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1311.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: already engaged constituents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1313.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think, you know, as we're vetting it, this is great, but I think that these are two concerns that I'm hearing from people that don't know anything until it's already passed because they're not tied into a specific group or newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1332.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So just sharing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1533.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1534.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think when we're thinking of being accessible, I think, sure, you start at, we need a starting point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1542.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I agree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1543.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, don't we want the mechanisms in place that we are going to reach everyone, everyone that we can and making sure that we're getting it to the families and the residents that don't have access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1556.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1559.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't, when we try, we want to do this because it's something that's very important, it's needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1565.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1565.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that we need a partner in the city that's going to sit with us and hold our hands and walk us through the processes so we can make sure that we're making sure we're reaching everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1579.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it'll be a disservice, truthfully, because of what we're hearing and how divided our community is right now, and the haves and the have-nots that they say the city council has now a newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1594.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And who is it reaching?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1595.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, it's reaching to the haves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1597.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, why isn't it reaching the have-nots?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1599.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because we haven't vetted out properly how to get it to those avenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1602.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, it could be a simple, it could be a simple resolution, but everybody in this meeting doesn't have, we don't have control of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1610.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1611.582s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, you know, I appreciate a chairperson reaching out to Mr. Smerdy, but, and I understand that the mayor has their own message, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1622.532s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're the city council for the city in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1625.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That is the department that has to work for us to make sure that our message gets out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1630.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not saying put our message in with the mayor's, but having the avenues in place that it's reaching everybody that we can conceivably reach so there aren't concerns or questions or people that are divided against saying, here we go again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1648.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How many times have we heard this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1651.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People in West Medford know about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1653.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How come the people at Middlesex Ave don't know about it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1656.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We hear this every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1658.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, at least I have for the last 16 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1661.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just don't want to add another layer until we vet the process out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1666.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sounds great, and I appreciate it just for the fact that I can't tell you, I'm sure we all have heard, the lack of a local newspaper has absolutely crippled our community for getting information and really sharing and celebrating some really big news in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1685.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I think that, you know, as we move forward with these meetings, I think it's imperative that we meet with the city representatives that are going to sit with us and say, hey,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1696.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We might not hit every group, but we did everything we possibly could to reach these the the underprivileged groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1704.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the message is getting out to everybody, at least with an effort that was that was put forth by this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1712.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not at least that's how I feel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1714.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1793.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll make a default on you tonight, Matt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2243.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That brings a good point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2244.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that community channels, it's a little bit different, but I believe we can, to this point where we have a big issue or a big meeting coming up or needing to send a message, that we can add it to the loop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2266.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, if we wrote something up and sent it to communications, could that be added to the loop on the public access that because in the past we used to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2347.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, that, that's, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2349.379s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that might help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2350.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, we, we can chip away at this, uh, council chair, uh, lemon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2357.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let me see what we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2517.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2520.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2522.177s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is something that I found when I first started having our first meeting with the school committee, the Massachusetts School Committee Association, and giving us like a tutorial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2539.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I thought it was great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2541.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that when<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2543.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, when, uh, when Mark Rumley was our city solicitor, he would often bring us in individually and give us a, uh, you know, checks and balances the way of the world and legal and, um, and, uh, common, common practices of city Councilors, little course, but I don't know, maybe the clerk can help me with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2567.142s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can ask, um, legal about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2570.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we had a, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2572.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What's the word I'm looking for that we had, um, you know, uh, I'm, I'm, I'm drawing a blank, but it's, we would get together and have a, um, like a meeting together, like a learning, um, seminar where it really didn't affect the open meeting law because we called it, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2596.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a certain gathering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2598.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm having a brain freeze, Adam.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2629.272s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we can share, you know, we can, um, you know, separate the two groups with them and then even share some issues, but then not discuss them until, you know, maybe, uh, a committee of the whole meeting to describe, um, diversity inclusion subcommittee or committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2649.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, there's gotta be a way that we can do this, that, that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2652.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that I know when we were in the school committee, we used to have training together and it wouldn't affect us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2659.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, because I think this is a good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2661.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that anything will help and make sure that we stay on track of what we're trying to deliver here in Medford, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3708.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was supposed to be That's what I I'm under the same Understanding if we if we we dispose this paper if we do that that that's been practiced I believe adam for for a while if you receive in place on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3723.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's we have to re um re-enter it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3727.11s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then I think, yeah, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3730.272s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just continue it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3735.016s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What can we do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3741.52s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3741.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3742.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all we have to do is leave it alone because I think this is a working document because we could bring it up at our next meeting and that could be modified by asking for the certain guests that we want to come and help us<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3756.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh, get to some sort of resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=270.311s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=273.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, it seems that we've lost another legend here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=280.779s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He didn't have to have a first name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=282.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He didn't have to have a last name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=284.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was just known as Bruni and an individual that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=290.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: grew up with Down syndrome and was a family who had an amazing family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=298.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: His sister Carol Caraviello, Rick Caraviello's former council president, council Rick Caraviello's brother-in-law, great nieces and nephews that loved him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=311.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Bruni was a fixture, whether it was on the music site here in Medford, because he loved to dance and he loved to sing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=322.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But most people know Bruni and remember Bruni as one of the most committed Medford Mustang supporters in our athletic fields.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=333.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I remember a story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=335.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You don't really make it until Bruno, until Bruni recognizes you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=341.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We were coaching, I was coaching probably my 14th year at Medford High School, and our boys had just finished their sixth straight season without losing a GBL game, and we're going into the state finals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=353.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I wasn't nervous as a coach, I was ready to go, our boys were ready to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=357.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I remember someone beside me, and I turned to the right, and here's this posing gentleman wearing a Medford jacket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=365.148s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, Bruni, he says, coach,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=368.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, that minute, I said, boy, two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=370.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said, I made it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=372.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a team and as a coach, we made it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=374.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Bruni was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=375.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And two, that now I'm nervous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=379.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because Bruni was here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=381.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So he left that mark and everybody that crossed his path, he always had a smile on his face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=388.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He loved being around him, but individuals with Down syndrome, he lived a full and happy life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=398.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He just has had an amazing family that supported him and Mefford will miss him and send his condolences to his family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=406.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=445.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, Council President, you normally don't put a retiree from UPS on your agenda, but someone like Pat O'Brien, I get more phone calls from residents and owners of small businesses that talked about losing a fixture here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=463.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You all have, if you live in Medford, if you've been around Medford, you know, Pat O'Brien.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=467.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Pat's the hardest working individual I've ever seen in your life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=470.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, he's in a big brown truck and yes, he's always wearing brown, but he is always running.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=476.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's never stopping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=477.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's always giving back to the community, whether it was in his position as a UPS driver and, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=485.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I remember Pat as someone that volunteered at the ice rink, that drove the Zamboni to make sure the ice hockey team had the best surface, whether it be coaching baseball or coaching basketball for his children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=497.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was someone that was always a fixture in Metro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=500.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I just want to congratulate him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=502.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's a great role model for any Method resident that lives with the motto of working hard,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=509.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=512.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we wish Pat, uh, happy retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=515.98s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know what he's going to do with all that energy he has, but, um, maybe he can come here and, you know, maybe work with the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=524.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, help you with cleaning out the back room again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=527.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=527.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1116.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1117.353s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that, first of all, I care very deeply for a lot of our members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1123.756s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I respect you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1124.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I will tell you that having deep conversations with my fellow Councilors, that's not the intent of this Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1131.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we'll do everything that needs to be done to make sure that event comes through every single year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1137.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's too important for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1139.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In today's society, where we lack a true sense of community at times, that event brings everybody together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1145.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't know where where that might have come from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1147.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you, we will work hard together as a board to make sure that that's not something that's going to ever be forgotten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1153.981s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And and we understand how hard you work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1156.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that comes that evening that happens a lot of miscommunication and a lot of misunderstanding what was coming from the administration, the council, and your organization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1166.911s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think all it says is really having an open line of communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1171.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that Judy's working really hard with the mayor's office to set up a meeting with different clergy and different churches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1177.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the council president would probably love to be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1179.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to make sure that we're all together to make sure that this is an all-inclusive and a true celebration the way that you intended for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1187.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that you know I brought my kids to the event when they were babies and it's something that to this day they still remember the Christmas trees and not for what what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1197.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what the symbol of it but what it meant for the city and that was really unifying us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1201.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that we so appreciate everything you do and I appreciate that you even had to come up here and share what you had to because there might have been some negative<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1216.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm glad you were here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1219.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm glad that we got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1220.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had a chance to speak, get the word out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1222.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And really, I think most importantly, is rally around as a council as an organization as a city to do more of these type of functions, because they're so important to what we're doing here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1234.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, you want to talk about we have a room full of people that want to that are looking for true inclusion and peace and happiness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1240.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that you're you're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1243.539s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're the originators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1245.34s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've been doing this before people were looking for where to look, where there's peace and love and happiness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1251.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you are, in my eyes, the cornerstone of what we all should fight for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1259.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I'm sorry that there was any negative words that came out in discussions, but rest assured, I've talked to Council President<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1270.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna work very hard to make sure this doesn't change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1273.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now, I think that it's out there now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1276.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would love to see so many other of our churches and our synagogues and our different affiliations and partners throughout the community really rally around this event so we can use this as a true teaching moment for everybody and really celebrate that amazing event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1294.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that still hundreds of kids show up every year<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1299.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you didn't mention how much money goes out, Mrs. Lonergan, but I know you're talking to the hundreds of thousands that were raised and that were distributed to so many families that needed it and so many organizations that need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1313.824s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think it's to the point now, we don't have enough room for the people that want to donate Christmas trees so they can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1320.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what's the intent of the tree?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1322.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People don't realize you can hold what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1325.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: more prizes on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1326.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you get more money and more donations that can come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1329.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's one of the intents for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1330.756s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that people didn't realize how important that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1333.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's really just a mechanism to really stress the importance of gathering funds to support different initiatives throughout the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1342.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1345.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know how I feel about all of you personally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1347.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've known all of you probably my whole life, and I think that I'm proud to call you my friend, but I will tell you, as a council, I didn't hear, I haven't heard one negative thing moving forward with anything we're trying to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1359.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we're all one team, making sure that we're gonna spread this love.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1362.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2537.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2538.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2539.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Villescaz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2541.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think any time that we present a resolution or an ordinance that has a level of detail that we talk about law enforcement, I think it'd be prudent for us to maybe send this to subcommittee, invite the chief or someone in his stead to give us their input as our, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2559.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the city of Medford to make sure that what we're voting on has the best interests of our police department and our safety of our citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2570.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that it would be, um, it would be, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2577.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a prudent solution to move this forward to get a little bit more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2582.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I read is, you know, it's information that's gathered, but I'd like to get more information before I would vote on this and really get the input of the chief where it's mentioned a few times that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2598.035s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the ramifications through the police department and getting their input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2601.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would recommend that we would move this to one of the subcommittees, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2612.579s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That'd be perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2613.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And with that ask a representative from the police department there to share their input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3536.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I need to correct something, because I embarrassedly, I just got text with a couple of threats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3548.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. O'Brien did not retire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3555.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We received information from a colleague of his saying that he retired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3560.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the truth of the matter is, Mrs. O'Brien sent me a message and said, no, George, Pat was given a circle of honor award for his safe driving in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3575.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please, Pat,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3577.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I won't come home tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3579.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He is not retiring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3580.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If someone could reach out to his bosses, he'll be in work tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3584.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please forgive me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3586.437s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I make one mistake a year and that was it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3588.297s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4400.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4401.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Villescaz and thank you, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4405.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I'm going to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4409.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: bring us back to a few sessions ago, and I made a commitment that for one councilor, I would stand with the policy that I will not vote on any national or international vote that comes to this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4424.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we have so many issues right now within our community that I think our focus really needs to be on the measures of Medford right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4435.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4439.088s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the information will go out there that Councilor Scott Peli doesn't believe in this, or Councilor Scott Peli's belief is X or Y. The truth of the matter is, everybody is in favor of peace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4450.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I've had the opportunity to talk to so many<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4453.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: great residents of method both from Palestine that are in support of this resolution, that are from that are Jewish that are supporting this resolution, and a Jewish residents that are totally against this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4471.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I found that this one resolution gave me the opportunity to listen to some amazing people that she had some amazing thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4482.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what I find it more important is that we have an avenue to bring some very, very educated people that have their own thought process to come together and unite them, and then come back with a message that I will personally work with, that we can contact the people that have contacted me, bring my friends together, and then send a message together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4506.981s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because one thing that I've realized and something Medford doesn't need,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4511.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is another piece dividing our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4513.651s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So no matter what anybody votes or how they vote tonight, there's going to be a half that's really separated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4521.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's not from my opinion, my own opinion, my beliefs, but this is my opinion from the multiple phone calls I got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4529.486s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I did receive messages from people that asked me that if they could, if I could read something into the record or a statement to the record, and I on both sides, I, I recommend a recommended my Palestinian friends to send any messages they wanted me to read on the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4547.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've asked my friends on who feel that this isn't a resolution that they feel safe on that I would share the information show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4555.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if, if you would allow me I have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4575.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4576.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the council speaking as part of the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4582.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I am.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4582.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, I am.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4583.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4583.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if you'd like to do that, I'll... If that's all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4585.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll yield to you and then come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4977.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I completely understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4979.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a topic that I respect from all my fellow councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4983.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that anything that you've said, I don't think any of us disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4988.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's very important that everybody understand this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4990.209s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a council that is very cordial and respectful, and this isn't an easy and a simple issue that has a simple outcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4999.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you, as Councilor Sagan mentioned,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5004.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the communication I received from our constituents that felt the need that were scared to come out tonight, that really wanted to understand that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5018.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what is being said so far, they're feeling the opposite.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5021.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They feel that with this motion moving forward, that it hurts what we have in our community of bringing people together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5031.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, not my view, I'm explaining what residents have reached out to me and asked that I share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5040.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One person that I respect,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5043.69s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A former teacher of mine, who has been living in Israel for many, many years now, reached out with a comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5051.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He said, while nobody here wants to see any more death, people must remember that on October 6, there was a ceasefire agreement in effect that was holding well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5061.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: However, on October 7, Hamas terrorists violated the ceasefire and attacked<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5066.417s">[Scarpelli]</a>: kibbutzim, villages, and a music festival murdering 1,200 Israeli, including not only Jews, but Muslims, Christians, Jews, Americans, Thais, Russians, British, among others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5079.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: While mutilating many bodies, burning some alive in ovens, and raping countless women, there were people ranging in ages eight to 87 years old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5089.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was among over 230 kidnapped people that were brought back to Gaza, of which 136 are still being held.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5096.532s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If they are alive, we still have questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5099.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Since Hamas has not allowed the IRC to visit the hostages, we have no idea how any of them are doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5106.099s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A ceasefire resolution only gives confidence to Hamas that they are winning the war in the West and makes it harder to get the hostages, the bodies, back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5114.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Plus, Israel will not accept a ceasefire unless includes a return of all hostages and bodies as well as leadership of Hamas being sent into exile to a country that will accept them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5126.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unless those conditions happen, it doesn't matter how many cities or states or countries vote for a ceasefire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5132.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Israel will not accept it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5133.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that whether you believe in it or not, these are messages that come from families of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5140.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have another that was sent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5143.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that wanted to reach out in the statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5146.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Forgive me that they're longer, but to members of the council and those in attendance, thank you for listening to this statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5153.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The months since 10-7 have been extremely tight trying for the Jewish community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5158.981s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We experienced a predominantly attack on the brothers and sisters solely because they are Jewish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5165.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It brings back haunting memories of when this was commonplace not more than a century ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5171.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We are slaughtered not for the military advantage, not for political maneuvering, but because we're Jewish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5176.922s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The only thing different today is that there is a country and an army that will push back and defend us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5182.247s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In the World War Two during the programs in Russia,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5185.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and the inquisitions across Liberia and in ups or uprisings like Farhoud in Middle East, we were defenseless.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5194.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But today in the first time in 2000 years, we have the ability to stand up and push back against the Jew haters that are attempting to alienate us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5203.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In the latest, we have experienced rapidly rising anti-Semitism, including here at home, with genocide chants down the street at Harvard, and anti-Zionists who, by definition, call the destruction of the Jewish homeland in Israel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5219.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We hear louder and louder every day the warning signals that Jews are no longer safe, coupled with the thousands upon thousands who celebrated our deaths on 10-7.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5228.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We are scared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5230.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We cannot trust our local officials to stand against anti-Semitism, and we cannot trust our fellow citizens when we see them marching in the streets calling for more Jewish deaths.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5241.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our concerns are not heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5242.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our safety is ignored.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5244.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this ceasefire resolution before you is a symbol that you are telling Jews to once again not push back, not fight for the survival, but lay down and take it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5253.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That is what we hear when there are calls for Israel to call off the war against those who started this in the Battle of 10-7.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5261.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: During World War II, we did not have a ceasefire for Nazis or Imperial Japan, despite the horrific amount of civilian death in the war and aggression the Axis started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5270.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was no ceasefire against Al Qaeda 9-11, and the worldwide Jewish community will not abide the ceasefire with the Hamas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5277.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The common thread here is that there cannot be a ceasefire<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5281.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with groups whose entire reason for existence is ideological mass murder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5286.73s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The only type of viable, long-term, and durable ceasefire is one where Hamas' war-making ability is destroyed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5294.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Only then can Israeli lives and security of the Palestinians can be free from an Islamic dictatorship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5301.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A ceasefire that leaves Hamas in place is a banned<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5305.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: band-aid upon a cancer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5307.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It may save some lives in the short term, but guarantees more war, death, and destruction down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5313.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hamas officials have promised to repeat the genocide of 10-7 again and again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5320.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Israel will be forced to continue to defend their citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5323.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hamas will continue to try to kill Jews and hide behind their own Gaza subjects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5329.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Jews, Arabs, Israelis, Palestinians, all will suffer until Hamas is no longer<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5334.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: poses a threat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5335.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And even after this, there is those who are still not swayed by the existential fear of Jewish constituents face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5345.351s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I leave you with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5346.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why is the council taking such a stand?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5349.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What is it about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5350.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this war that is exceptionally different from all the other conflicts raging in the world, that makes it worth splitting a community further alienated, an already fearful minority, just to issue a statement about a handful of these beliefs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5365.859s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How does this serve the interests of Medford residents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5368.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what message do you think will be heard for your actions today?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5373.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for listening to these concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5377.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will tell you, I've shared some amazing conversations from my Palestinian friends that it was a great understanding, something that I will never understand the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5393.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the feelings that you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5395.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I could never, no one here, unless you're Palestinian or Jewish in Israel and understand the situation we're going through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5402.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to minimize that, to minimize that, to minimize that would be disrespectful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5407.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you that there is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5416.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a ground movement moving forward that I will gladly move forward with, with my friends that I've now worked with, that bringing our Palestinian people and our Jewish residents to find a clear message that we can work together, that could present to this community, that it's more of a unified front.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5437.437s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that that's what's important here in Medford today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5441.661s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, whether it's popular or not, that's not my intent here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5448.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have a strong belief in what I believe in when it comes to issues dealing with national, international issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5459.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm gonna abstain from any votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5461.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will not vote for anything on any agenda that comes forth in this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5465.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've done this in the past, and I'll do this moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5469.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That doesn't mean George Scarpelli doesn't believe in peace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5472.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That doesn't mean that George Scarpelli doesn't believe that there isn't a way to unify our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5481.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is who I am, who my residents have requested their information be spread.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5491.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I thank you for the time, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10258.258s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10258.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Personal privilege.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10261.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My comments that were, like I stated, these were residents that asked me to read things on the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10267.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, this is, don't divert what was said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10272.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what I wanted to just make sure that that was stated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10276.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10292.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not for every Palestinian that I talked to would have great discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10297.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I offered the same advice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10299.016s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I offered the same chance to read.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10301.717s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It just wasn't sent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10302.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10303.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14539.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14543.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just, and I think that I understand where the motion's, the resolution's coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14549.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we just need to be cognizant in the fact that anything that we put forth that companies can look into and say, hey, well, let's take a chance in Medford, but remember if,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14566.917s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it doesn't work, we're going to, you know, it's going to penalize us in a sense that, you know, being taxed and when then that would lead to what we're talking about and seeing unsavory or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14582.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: other entities entering or being just admitted into each community that would affect us in a negative way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14590.016s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I understand the frustration because we have three master plans that we spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on for Method Square and nothing's been done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14600.221s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't seen anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14601.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that, as we said, moving forward, I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14605.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the helping with some of the zoning changes and the understanding of what we're doing moving forward with the planning department to really see what works in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14617.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would tend to hold off on some resolution like this until we see a more of a robust plan that the city is hopefully unveiling relatively soon from what I hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14628.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15709.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For our newer members, this is a very contentious situation with the neighbors of the BJ's neighborhood, with the implementation of the new, the building of the new gas station at the corner of Middlesex Street and BJ's entrance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15726.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One thing that we wanted to make sure we cognizant with the neighbors being informed with everything that's happening so they are not left in the dark like they felt the last 25 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15743.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what's been happening, I guess, is the construction work<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15749.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they were setting pylons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15751.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as a gym, they were hitting the pylons to set the footings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15755.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They shook houses and neighbors were scared to death.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15761.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nobody was informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15762.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They let everybody know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15763.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I give a lot of credit to our court enforcement officers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15767.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They ran to the site at 630 that morning and talked to the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15773.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: project manager and he showed him some of the seismology equipment that they've had and said that it's not affecting them, but the neighbors want to have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15785.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: would like to call for meeting with the representative what we did agree with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15789.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe Council President was that there would be a representative from BJS that would be at our beck and call for our neighbors so if we can reach out to them I don't know where it fell it that it was with the building of the building department, or it was with the mayor's office I don't know who has the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15805.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if we can ask who that connection is and ask him to come to the next meeting, because I think some of the community members really want their voice heard, and especially the fact that they did tell the code enforcement officer they'll be doing this again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15822.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in a few weeks when they set the gas tanks underground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15827.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there'll be more shaking and some other people had some questions with the gas lines that are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15833.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How is that affecting it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15834.719s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we had a call that evening<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15840.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a water main burst in front of one of the residents' homes, and they wanted to see if it's attributed to that type of work that was being done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15850.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we need to be super, super delicate with these neighbors, because as one of the members that failed them that night in voting,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15865.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in an irresponsible manner, not knowing the laws and the rules of that night, and not having a city solicitor to protect us, it put us in a really, really bad situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15876.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And whatever we can do for those neighbors, we need to follow through with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15879.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15880.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scrivina.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15881.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Two questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15904.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even if by chance we can get at them, reach out to the neighbors in the immediate vicinity of 4th Street, Middlesex, just letting them know that this is what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15915.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One resident said that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=731.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=733.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=736.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's also important as we start in this new format that we're not redundant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=741.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we have, it's how we're rolling this out, something with the zonal reform.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=747.16s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's something so important that, you know, having one Councilor do the legwork, then three other Councilors do the same legwork.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=755.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then again, to the community process, then again, I think we,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=762.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't wanna make this more than it has to be in the sense that let's not suffocate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=769.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the common resident and the fact that what we're trying to do is great and really highlight and stress certain aspects of what we're doing and certain agenda items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=780.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same time, I think zoning could be a little different because it is so important and it is citywide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=786.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that that's one of the reasons why we spent so much time making sure that we secure the funding for the consultants, making sure that we have the right team in place with the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=799.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: office of community development and making sure that we create something that we're encompassing everybody's efforts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=806.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that we, something similar that we use, for example, the way Somerville, when they started their projects, as they started looking at their gateway communities, whether it was lower Broadway, whether it was Assembly Row, it was always done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=822.429s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It wasn't done in a vacuum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=823.73s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was something very open and transparent where I think that could be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=829.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just don't want to have the same thing said over and over again because the redundancy might pull people away from being part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=837.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if that makes sense, I'd rather see us work more as a team and show the unity together with the community, especially with what our ultimate agenda is when we push any of our subcommittees through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=853.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At least that's my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=855.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1874.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1878.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1880.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So something that I've talked to, I know that it's been bantered around the state, but I think it's something that as we look at this topic and looking for how to fund it, I think that one of the things we might want to consider is bringing a state delegation in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1898.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and working on a statewide mandate of cyclists registering their bicycles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1906.541s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And with that fee, supporting any safety recommendations and upgrades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1913.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to assist with what our goals are for cycle safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1920.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think, as we know, we have probably the most<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1928.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, if everybody had the respect of a bicyclist, I think it could make the world a lot better, but we also have, um, those rogue cyclists that tend to cross the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1941.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, and, and I think that's what makes at times a site cycling world, a little difficult for some people to, to, um, engage with because they think that, you know, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1955.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the content of, bicyclists don't follow the rules, or if a car was taking a right turn, I heard this through the, this bicycle lanes is confusing because something simple as a person taking a right turn and a bicyclist cutting in behind traffic and ramming into the side of your car and then you have damage to your automobile and the person rides away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1979.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and not having an identification piece for a police report or anything to that nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1989.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No different than how the license plates started with automobiles, but I think it's something that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1996.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: putting a fee to that and having an identification number, it could be beneficial for what the greater plan is, and that's more safety, more bike lanes, and where it's, you know, when we started raising fees in the community I work in, the city was in, they were an uproar for the fact that the fees were all<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2018.766s">[Scarpelli]</a>: was they were all increased.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2020.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But then when you understood that all traffic and parking fees go directly to youth programming and schools, then people don't mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2030.613s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, you know, for street sweeping, weekly street sweeping, people see the streets being swept us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2035.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, we understand now, if you're going to break the law, that's what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2039.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you look at identified fee structure, and you're looking for something like bicycle registration,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2044.981s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and putting that money directly into our roads and for safety purposes, I think it's hugely beneficial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2052.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=372.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that probably first, maybe on its own paper, I think that's something that was relevant years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=381.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're seeing the fact that our roads, especially our sidewalks,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=385.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: seeing the negative impact, especially after all the bonding that we've provided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=389.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then the feedback that we've heard back was that a lot of the lack of functioning of the projects is due to lack of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=401.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: license contractors that can do the job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=403.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then see because the season, something I put out a few years ago, I'd like to bring it back and maybe put it as a motion or with this or a separate motion that we asked the commissioner to do a cost analysis of starting again, our own sidewalk and hot top crew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=423.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we presented this, I think my first term, I had a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=428.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the ability to take the DPW director in the neighboring community who actually broke down the equipment that's needed, the type of vehicle that would be needed, the three staff members plus their benefits, and what it came down to is having a crew that worked through the warmer weather<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=453.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and working at our pace to do that, the sidewalk repairs and sidewalk management plan, it really benefited neighboring communities where Medford, what my bone of contention is, I'm sure Councilor Bears remembers that when we keep<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=471.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when the administration keeps coming to us with $2.5 million bonds to redo sidewalks and stump removal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=480.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to this day, another piece to this is having that list updated and reporting back to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=486.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that it'll be good for the new council to see what we've done with that $2.5 million and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=493.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: how little gets done with that in a certain amount of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=496.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't know if we can add that or maybe as a second motion, ask follow up with the director of DPW commissioner to maybe put together a budget request for a hot top and sidewalk crew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=513.191s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with the staffing and materials needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=516.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that doesn't have to be done by next month, but it might be something we could look at for the budget season and saying, well, look at this impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=523.779s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's do the math.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=526.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it's 2.5 million and we've only done 400 panels, sidewalk panels, and what's equivalent to neighbor communities,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=536.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what does it take to do 400 panels, and we see that there's a drastic financial difference, I think that we should really entertain that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=544.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we've offered it, and I know some DPW directors in the past have wanted to do it, but it's always been frozen at the administration level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=554.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The other piece to that is the benefit of having a sidewalk<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=559.761s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and hot top crew with potholes all year round, if there are down times that those three staff members could also be used in the parks department if needed, could be used in different departments when needed, you know, when you do see a lag.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=574.048s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if that's okay with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=653.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the time for our new members is that weather got in the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=658.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Lack of I believe at one point we're hiring landscape contractors to do sidewalks because there were so limited for for licensed contractors that typically do this with having some time to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=675.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So yeah, we got that desperate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=677.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would hate to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=679.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, because I think we might see the ramifications a few years down the line when you bring in people that didn't do things the proper way if that's the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=778.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As part of their equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=816.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, this is something for budget season, my request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=819.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it still gets some time, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=820.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=828.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I love listening to Adam get cramps in his fingers, so I think it's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=870.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=878.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Would you like me to repeat that motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=901.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=903.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to add Council business comment that other look at the cost for a Luke sidewalker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=915.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to also add as one of their duties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=921.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that rounds off a whole team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=923.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you look at sidewalk, hop-top crew, slash snow removal on main sidewalks, that's a pretty complete position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=934.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I did Google it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=936.099s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He is right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=943.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, if you want to use Chewbacca shovel, is that in there too?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1224.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if I can, Madam Chair, I think that what's important is I don't know if you can effectively do that job unless you have a true understanding of what, like you said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1236.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the facilities, what's needed, how to have a working document, because as we said, it could be windows one day, but as the windows need repair, it might be flooring, and then understanding how that breaks down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1249.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that, I know that we've in the past had a comprehensive study done for all the buildings, but I think if we invite the, I've yet to meet the facilities director, maybe inviting him to one of our next meetings and asking them if they do have a comprehensive plan,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1266.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, with what Councilor Bears was saying, so we can see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1271.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, what a working document looks like to maintain or bring these buildings back up to par and making sure that we stay ahead of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1281.553s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that the other piece of that, there are so many things that we need, and there are so many avenues that we can use, but there truly isn't a point person that, at least I haven't heard yet, that can look at different grants and different avenues that we can use to fund these projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1299.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1300.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's a good start to have a facilities manager, but I would love to see what other communities have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1306.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, most communities have a facilities manager that has an assistant manager that also has a facilities crew that does electrical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1316.231s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They have an electrician, a plumber, and a carpenter that's on staff that you're not wasting time or money bringing outside contractors to do things we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1330.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in most cases at a minute's notice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1332.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that that's how most facilities teams work in most communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1340.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, I remember when Medford, the school department, used to have its own maintenance team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1346.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They had a locksmith, an electrician, we had a plumber, we had a carpenter, we had a painter, that they worked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1355.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, this is with the old schools, the neighborhood schools, that they kept them up as much as they could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1361.859s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we're looking at what's so-called the new schools now that are now outdated and in desperate need of upgrades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1368.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1370.666s">[Scarpelli]</a>: having the new facilities manager come to us, and believe me, I don't expect the person to come up and say, yeah, this is what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1377.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we might have to look at asking the mayor to bring in a consultant that goes through the whole building, like Weston and Sampson, that other communities use, that go through all of our buildings and come through with the honest assessment of what we need in our priorities, starting high priority first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1398.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1631.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we've seen, Madam President, through the chair, I believe it's a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1637.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we're seeing our city engineer being more proactive when we're opening our streets to private entities, let's say a resident wanting to change from a lead pipe to copper water pipe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1655.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe the new policies in place now that the homeowner now has to pay the contractor to go curb to curb, which if what bothers me with that is that I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1668.698s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's still question, I think, to ask the city engineer that when the utilities come in,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1675.999s">[Scarpelli]</a>: are they mandated for the same type of restoration?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1680.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If they open the street from what I've been told, they're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1685.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They open up the area that needs to be open that they can get to, they resurface it, they let it sit one cycle, and they come back and resurface it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1695.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1698.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the basic resident, the homeowner, or, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1703.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The landlord that has to pay for the safer, you know, transfer of lead to copper has now<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1711.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: bringing up the rate that's falling back on the consumer because now the contract is not saying, okay, let's keep it the same price.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1722.417s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're boosting the price to an unimaginable fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1727.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'd like to know if we're seeing the same with utilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1732.264s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our biggest issue right now that we've seen and heard from time and time again, using Winthrop Street as a good example,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1738.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That street has been opened up, I think, maybe 10 times in the last 10 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1743.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you're looking at the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1745.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The same areas being opened up, but there isn't collaboration with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1754.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: national grid gas work to Medford's infrastructure, water pipes that I think that if there could be a better way to communicate that to minimize any of the resurfacing of the roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1766.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that the biggest thing with I believe this is the having the utilities coming in and going curb to curb as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1775.11s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I, I believe that's something that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1779.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we need a better understanding, maybe through a motion, is just asking some clarity with the city engineer just to give us a report of what the utility standards are when opening streets and for private residents that want to make, you know, change their water lines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1799.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just so we have an understanding and then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1802.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because I, you know, we've heard it for years now, the biggest concerns and issues we have in our roads and sidewalks are the fraudulent work done by the utilities when they come in and not being held accountable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1816.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The biggest part of that is also that most communities have what's called a clerk of the works, that when they are doing a job, permitted a job, you have a clerk of the works for the DPW that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1830.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: watches and oversees the opening of the area, the closing, then the cleaning of the area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1837.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's something we asked for in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1841.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe we asked for that if we could ask for a fee to be added to any road work that would pay for Clerk of the Works and we were told that can't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1853.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that they told us that that's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1857.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: something that we can't request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1858.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if we can get that motion to the city engineer to give us a better understanding of the utility side of the roads, and hopefully we can police that a little bit better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=1899.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There is, I believe it's five years, a new road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2005.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we do have and if they can update us with that, because they have in the past where they tell us what level we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2016.34s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that might be helpful to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2017.661s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we could see, you know, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2021.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry, Adam.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2023.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2073.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2076.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: allow permits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2079.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, it's very simple, like, what's good for the goose?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2176.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To that, I believe Councilor Marks spearheaded that process, and I don't believe we have many double polls left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2183.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that with that announcement, I think Councilor Marks was very proactive with making sure, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that all of the double polls have been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2197.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: converted back to the single pole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2198.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So let's get an idea, maybe ask, I think, I think, Mr. Randazzo might be the person to ask, you know, I'd be happy to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2217.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's funny because when we asked the gas company, I think the, uh, was it Harvard street?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2221.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had the issues with some serious, uh, high level, uh, gas leaks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2228.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They were pretty forthcoming with the report of how many we had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2232.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't think it was really meant to poke the bear, but it was really made for just, uh, information gathering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2240.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we stay at the top of things with the neighbors that called.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2244.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2245.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a little alarming that the utilities would say that, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2247.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's pretty disheartening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2249.202s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2298.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we can pull old papers back<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2306.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, I think maybe bringing in the representatives that we work with, with especially National Grid, was super, super helpful when we had the Harvard Street issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2314.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So maybe just having an open conversation with one of their leaders to say that might have been policy sent from a letter, but more of a personal level, maybe there's a way that we can get some information that we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2367.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for the engineer, motion for the engineer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2374.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just understanding the policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2375.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's the first thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2376.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Once we understand the policy, then I think we can move on something to this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2380.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2381.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then Councilor Lazzaro had maybe something that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2390.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2392.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want to second that too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2395.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2581.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: just I know that just probably having the union president involved and making sure that that's the biggest issue we talk about any sort of volunteer work, especially when it comes to DPW.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2592.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I remember that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2594.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And most of the time, it's not a big deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2597.423s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that even cleaning up behind the high school, remember the hill?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2602.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we came in with about three teams full of kids that wanted to clean that area, and just making sure that DPW gets paid overtime to do that, just we're informed and they understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2613.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think that it's ever been a problem, but I think it's something that just they want to be part of the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2620.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So whenever we do anything with volunteering, I think making sure we have that as a priority just to make sure that they're in the loop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2763.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's funny if you go down the road further to more affluent communities, they have the soundproof barriers all the way down 128 supporting their city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2774.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's a little disheartening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2776.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know, and that's not Councilor Donato, I mean, Representative Donato, he worked his tail off to get what we have right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2783.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when we first did 93, when they first did the 93 project,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2788.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They, for some reason, they asked for it on that side of the highway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2793.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But for some reason, we didn't ask for it on this side of the highway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2796.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that was the biggest issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2805.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He called everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2819.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, yeah, it might be something we can ask the state representative just to get us an update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2825.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But yeah, I don't think it's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2827.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I think he's pulled every rabbit out of every hat to try to make it work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2831.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2834.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just so you know, if I won the megabucks, that was one of the things on my list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2837.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Wow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2838.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just, you know, $500 million gets you a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2840.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm going to buy me a house first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2842.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I already bought that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2843.186s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, already?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VjU9zacMOgA&t=2844.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=319.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President, and I appreciate all the hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=323.747s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that City Clerk has put into making sure that we have the proper people at the table to answer any questions that the community has reached out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=334.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I first want to thank Representative DiNardo for being here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=338.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We realize that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=342.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He really doesn't have much information either, but he's here just to really listen to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=346.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I really appreciate you doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=349.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And especially when you're talking about an issue that really concerns a lot of people and a lot of people looking for answers and really not getting many responses back from other parties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=361.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we appreciate you being here tonight, Representative Donato.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=365.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that both Representative Garbally and Representative Barber<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=371.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're invited, but they know that it's the same message that Representative Donato would share, and as their colleagues, I think that he's representing everyone, but this really falls into his district, which is key.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=385.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I brought this forth because we did have some neighbors that had some concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=391.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the concerns really, you know, it goes from one extreme to another extreme.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=397.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One extreme is simple is that we understand and we want to be supportive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=401.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to the people that need this type of shelter at the time, but we want to make sure we're educated and everybody knows the process, especially the neighbors, the direct abutters, that they're informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=416.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've received calls from people that are in the health fields that find it a little alarming that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=423.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What they're seeing in different neighborhoods in different states is the lack of vaccinations for the support that we're giving for the people that are in need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=436.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that there are a lot of questions that have to be asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=440.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are a lot of questions that have to be answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=443.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, I think the key, what we'll hear tonight is really just people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=449.429s">[Scarpelli]</a>: sharing what the how they feel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=450.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=453.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I also understand that truly, from what we've heard, both from the communications from the mayor's office and outside is that we really need the the landlord<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=467.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need someone from the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities, and someone from the Mayor's Office, and most importantly, someone from the Governor's Office that's going to come in and really set up a meeting that really can answer some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=486.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're hearing that it's a done deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=490.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but at the same time, we're not seeing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=492.827s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're hearing that the mayor has put out an MOU, but it hasn't been followed through yet from the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=499.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's a lot of different variables that are still left wide open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=503.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate, I think that the phone calls I got from a lot of teachers and parents from especially the McGlynn and the Roberts where they're at extended capacity right now and making sure that having<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=521.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to the public schools right now would be totally devastating in some of our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=527.045s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that, you know, the questions we have is infrastructure, George.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=531.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do we have enough police?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=532.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do we have enough fire?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=534.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Does the health department have enough support to make sure that everything is on the up and up at this facility?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=542.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there are a lot of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=544.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So like I said, Mr. President, this is really, I put this out for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=550.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the residents that had some questions that can share it publicly so we can get it on the record and hopefully the governor's office can follow through with a meeting so people are notified properly and for one person<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=567.512s">[Scarpelli]</a>: mentioned that for her and her family, it's scary, not in a disrespectful thought process to the people that are going through this, but it's scary because of the organizational piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=578.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that that's where they're not understanding and not knowing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=582.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that other people want to talk, so I yield to them now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=588.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=601.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First time here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2345.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate you bringing this forward because this was started by a community member like yourself that had an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2350.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we all feel the same pain of the lack of lack of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2355.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2359.076s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we'll relay this to the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2360.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we'll put it in a form of motion that when we do have this meeting, that the information is put out the robocall for all the residents in that neighborhood for at least to get those questions answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2372.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I think that one thing we all share are these same questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2378.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, we understand the situation that we're in that we're put in, but I think the biggest biggest concerns right now is getting the answers to the questions that we have so we can move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2389.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is the big problem with what you see in most communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2392.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When there isn't transparency, there isn't lack of there is a huge lack of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2398.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2399.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is truly coming from, you know, the state level, where I think that, you know, looking at the governor's office and making sure that they hear us and they that that meeting when that meeting does come, come to fruition, that the message is sent loud and clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2414.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's, it's, it's, you know, this is this is an issue immigrations of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2420.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a big issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2421.316s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a bigger issue than we have right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2423.417s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why I know Mr. Pagliarulo brings up good points in the sense that this is a federal issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2428.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2430.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's not fair to the families that are brought here either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2433.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've had the fortune of coaching a lot of these young people that are forced to come into our country because they don't have anything else, and they thrive in our country, and they try to make it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2447.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: make it through as legal as possible to make sure they want to be American citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2452.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's a hurdle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2454.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We understand on every level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2455.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But with this situation that we're talking about right now with the Riverside issue, there are a lot of issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2461.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And something that I'm going to stand strong on, we don't have the infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2466.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That has to be stressed to the governor through the MOU.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2469.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This be stressed that the mayor, we don't have the infrastructure in place to house number of families and people for more than what they're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2480.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate Councilor Lazzaro bringing that question up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2483.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there is a state law that says that truly, I've talked to teachers today, talked to teachers from both the McGlynn and the Roberts that called me about this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2491.105s">[Scarpelli]</a>: St.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2491.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: George, we truly don't have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2494.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it's we're filled to capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2495.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And with the lack of support that they have in the special needs department, it's it would magnify things to a degree that we could never recover from our kids will not recover from, you know, so you bring a lot of good points, you know, trash health department being involved, the police making sure how do we how do we police that area that a friend on on zoom talking about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2517.745s">[Scarpelli]</a>: health concerns and vaccinations and making sure that people that are coming into our country, listen, we can't come into the schools, our kids can't enter schools without being vaccinated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2526.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if they're coming into this, into the housing, we're the United States of America, we should be able to vaccinate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2533.427s">[Scarpelli]</a>: these young people that are coming in and make sure they're as healthy as possible if they're going to be in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2539.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's a lot of pieces that we all share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2541.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, you know, it's not something that this council is for or against.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2547.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just provided, we wanted to provide an avenue so people can come up and talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2551.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not, this isn't you against us, it's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2553.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we've got to find the middle ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2556.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We got to find the process to make sure the communication<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2560.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and the answers are met from everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2563.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We feel the same way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2564.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We all have the same questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2566.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, you know, just because we're city councils don't mean that, doesn't mean that we have the answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2569.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've seen it a thousand times in different formats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2571.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, I appreciate you bringing this forward because I think that that's what this, that's what a good community is about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2577.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's an issue, community member steps up, city council step in when they're not being heard and we share, we give that avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2584.763s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate that and understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2587.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We feel the same way you do in the sense of getting the word out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2591.548s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whether you're for it or against it doesn't matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2593.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The truth of the matter is we need a line of communication so everybody feels safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2598.313s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whether you live in the hills or whether you live right on Riverside Ave, these are big concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2603.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because like you said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2605.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not just people that are, you know, the same people that are moving in with these health issues, vaccine issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2610.424s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're going to be shopping at Wegmans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2612.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're going to be playing in the parks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2613.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're going to be, you know, in our libraries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2615.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We, that possibly, so it's making sure that we have everything in place to make sure that we're giving them the best opportunity to thrive while they're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2622.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2624.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want to let you know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2625.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2705.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So think of what people want, you know, of me, but this is why I'm Bruce America, far from a bigot, you've come up here and spoken in favor of many different issues, and it didn't matter what the issue was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2717.29s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that if that's, if that's the Facebook army that's out there, that's that you don't have to we got just to just erase it, because, you know, you've come in, you've come 1000 times to this podium, and support of many different people didn't matter what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2731.437s">[Scarpelli]</a>: whatever color they are, race they are, whatever gender they are, you're always there to support people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2736.92s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, I think that that should be mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2739.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2861.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a vacant office building, it's not a hotel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3449.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that again, I think we're missing the point here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3451.842s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that what the biggest concern is communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3455.364s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the biggest concern and what people are saying are valid valid points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3460.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it's offensive, I can understand that too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3462.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can understand how some people might feel that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3465.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But they're legitimately valid points when you're talking about, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3471.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we communicating enough?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3472.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it transparent enough to understand that if we're allowing this to happen, are we giving the support to help these families thrive?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3482.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think some of these questions like, are they being vaccinated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3485.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not just for protection for the people that are in our community, but for the people that are gonna be in the same area with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3495.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it is a legitimate question that when I reached out to different communities like Cambridge, like Revere, these are the same questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3504.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I don't want to cloud this as being something that was really racist or this should be failed, it's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3511.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm a first-generation American.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3513.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My father and mother came through Ellis Island.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3515.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand the situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3518.304s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I work with kids that are from Lynn, same type of children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3523.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I understand what they go through every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3526.553s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I feel their pain and I work for them every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3528.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same time, with this situation,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3531.579s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's not muddy the water and understand something very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3534.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is just about communication, making sure that not only our citizens have the answers they want to be protected, but also let's not forget the people that are coming into these houses and understand to make sure that we're doing the right thing for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3549.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think it goes both ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3551.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think it's just this shouldn't be pitted again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3553.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like I said earlier, this isn't something that one against the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3556.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that we need more information to be distributed to all parties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3563.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To make sure that we're making sure we're taking care of not only the visitors that are here, but also the residents that are here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3570.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that like, from what I heard from the most part, from the phone calls, the emails, and people that are coming to this podium, it's really not understanding why they're not being heard or why the messages are being sent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3582.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I thank Representative Donato for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3586.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand the mayor has sent multiple messages about not truly knowing or getting the answers that they need, but that's why having that meeting with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3595.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it a done deal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3597.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've heard it was to and then I heard it wasn't because nothing signed yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3601.541s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, the council bear said this is an issue that it's coming directly from a landlord and the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3612.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3614.005s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're hearing is our political leaders don't have the power to get that information out that we need yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3623.407s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So like I said, I'm hoping that with getting this meeting out and all the parties are understanding, because I'm sure Representative Donato is going to go back to the state level and they're going to hear what Medford's saying and forward against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3636.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that we need to have that meeting that really answers these big questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3641.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, it's not just,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3643.51s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, for the last caller, it's the last person on zoom, it's, it's not just to protect our citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3648.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The truth of the matter is, it's really protecting those young, especially the children that are in that in that location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3654.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because no one's giving them any answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3656.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And listen, for someone that's worked in this field, and worked with this demographic for the last 1520 years, 30 years, I understand how difficult it is for these families, and what they're going to be going through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3669.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I would hate to say that we're rushing this process through just to say we house them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3676.437s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That doesn't do people any good either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3679.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have to make sure we're protecting their safeties as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3682.563s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4296.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for being here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4297.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it took some time, but this is obviously a very bothersome situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4304.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The way the process was handled in many different levels was very alarming to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4313.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like the lack of communication was alarming to us, but I see some of the protocol in place that I'm reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4322.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I find it a little alarming where the biggest thing as we went through this process and how difficult it was and the concerning issues that we saw, probably the biggest thing that affected me personally is how many people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4341.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: mentioned to me long time voters said they would never ever vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4348.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in a local election again, by the way, the optics looks now, there was nothing wrong, I guess that everything came out that you did the refill, there was a recall or recount for for numbers, everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4363.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It wouldn't nothing would change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4364.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It wasn't this this conspiracy theory that was out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4368.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what I do know is what I saw firsthand and what I heard firsthand election day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4375.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what I do want to make sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4377.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we do moving forward is making sure that people that are involved in the election process, whether it be your office, our commissioners, whether it's our poll workers, or whether it's people that are working the polls, and that's where I'm going to come from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4392.747s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have people that exercise their rights<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4396.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to go and work polls, and I'm reading the criteria, and I've been doing this since I was a little kid, neighboring communities, and understand that this is a process that's legally in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4410.372s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there's something even here that says that what people don't understand, what I'm speaking is poll workers, people that don't know that are watching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4419.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: candidates have an opportunity to build a team to make sure they're working their team to most efficient process to make sure they get their voters out on election day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4435.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So people work very hard to set up these teams that at each polling location, they had what's called the poll watcher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4446.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And a poll watcher would sit in an approved area by law,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4450.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they would, I know that it said that they're not to provide a chair or table, we understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4458.076s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have here that this is the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4461.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is where we wanna help people feel comfortable and understand the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4465.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there's this part here that says they're not to sit down, even if they bring their own chairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4473.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's something I would question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4476.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, I think that's terrible for the fact that it's exactly why we're here tonight for these little things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4483.331s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The understanding of educating our workers, the process of the new pads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4489.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, what we trained, because I was part of one of these teams, they were trained, the poll workers were trained to understand this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4498.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a person comes in, they're asked for their ID or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4504.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They were then asked for their name and address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4509.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then they would say their name and they would repeat back their name and address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4513.64s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we saw firsthand though, because I was there, what I saw was it would say, they would show their ID and then they'd go right through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4522.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It wasn't repeated in some cases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4524.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In some other cases, their names were given but they weren't repeated back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4531.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the whole format was a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4534.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The way that poll workers that volunteered to come out, the way they were treated was horrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4542.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So as we're moving forward to this process, now, whatever the process is, if it's just putting out the markers, where to stand on election day, because we didn't do that this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4555.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4555.761s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know, but we didn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4557.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we had people at different locations moving anywhere they wanted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4561.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you had some areas with some aggressive poll managers that are coming out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4567.169s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I forgot what we call them, but, and then we had other areas that we didn't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4570.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it was inconsistencies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4572.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the process in total, I'm reading this, and I'll be honest with you, I'm not truly satisfied because when some of these issues occurred with the ballots and who got what ballots and the misprinting of the ballots, we as a council found it to be a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4591.705s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We said, quote unquote, that perception is reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4596.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if we need to do anything, please, let's work as a team to figure out a way, whether it's approving money, whether it's hiring people, whether it's getting people educated, we didn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4604.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Instead, we just ran with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4606.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it was exactly what we were afraid of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4609.64s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4611.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was completely a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4613.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then the process moves forward with people getting ballots that they shouldn't have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4618.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then we have, we've corrected that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4620.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then there was some ballots that, you know, that had the wrong dates and we corrected that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4624.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then, then we go to the election day and there were multiple issues with people not understanding the process and how people were treated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4632.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then you move after the election process and understanding that there were legal documents that were sent out saying, for instance,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4642.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mail-in ballots will be tabulated here at City Hall and posted at eight o'clock at City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4649.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was never done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4651.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Questions that people have asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4652.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about when it stopped, polling stops at eight, the voting stops at eight, and 8.30 things will be posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4659.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, we didn't get posts, we didn't realize the final numbers until one o'clock in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4666.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these are all legitimate issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4668.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I read through this report, and it sounds great, but I think it needs more substance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4673.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it needs more, I think the biggest part right now, especially when we talk about the election day, is the education and the fact that the poll workers<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4685.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: are valued.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4687.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if we have to find that if value is by by expense, for those important dates, then we should find whatever we need to make sure financially they're valued.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4697.963s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we get more people interested in this council talk about, you know, what we're going to talk about in a minute about a rate pay raise for school committee and saying we'll get better candidates if we pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4708.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But let's find a way to make sure that we're putting everything in place so the March elections, we don't have the issues we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4716.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because like I said, I hate the fact that we had to feed into the narrative of what we saw.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4726.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And some of these issues are concerning to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4729.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I still, I don't like the fact, this is part of the election process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4734.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And poll watchers, and I know for sure,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4738.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because I'm married to one of them, that some of these people are angels, and the way they were treated, and the way that when we were then presented to explain to them the laws of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4751.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we had and then being treated the way they were was appalling to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4757.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we did was not only did we let questions and let perception become reality, the biggest concern I had right now was we lost good people that dedicated their voting rights to this community every time we had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4775.541s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we have to find a way as a team<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4778.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to do is to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4778.574s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Commission your office in this council, the mayor's office to make people feel confident that they should come out to vote that their vote does count that if they're part of the process of a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4796.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they're given every right that they're supposed to be given to the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4800.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And at the same time, educate the people so they understand the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4804.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I hate to be harsh because I tell you what, when I say love, I love some of your commissioners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4813.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I go way back with the commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4815.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's no way to blame here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4817.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think my frustration came, especially right after the election, was the lack of communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4823.274s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and the lack of understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4824.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so, you know, here we are, January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4830.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the 20th and we're talking about the report that was passed in and I think that this is a good start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4837.148s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But for this councilor, I would recommend that we start a subcommittee, Mr. President, with this process that we meet with both commissioners and the elections office to make sure that this council is working, working step by step to make sure you're getting everything you need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4855.575s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we don't have the lack of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4858.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the lack of employees downstairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4861.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We saw it firsthand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4863.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know it's not easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4864.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know that it's a it's an undermanned process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4869.02s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we're saying if this is the council, we our our strength is making sure that we vote on a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4876.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're working hand in hand with the commission and the elections office that we're working through this all the way through the budget season to make sure that we're staffing a staff that's gonna give it the respect it deserves moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4892.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I think this was, there were a lot of concerning issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4895.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, it's someone that's built up a lot of sadness and anger for the simple fact that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4905.16s">[Scarpelli]</a>: people that were there, people that dedicated themselves to the election process, and people that just came out to vote have now found themselves not wanting to do that anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4914.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to me, that is a disgrace and it's sad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4918.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4964.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the commission's fault.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4965.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the election, the election department's fault.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4968.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that if we really want ownership of this, we all have to have ownership in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4972.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that, you know, we don't, I take blame in it myself because, you know, we let that happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4978.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We let that office go down to one person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4982.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We saw the mistakes, so is that okay, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5792.756s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just one more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5794.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5794.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think Councilor Leming brought something up that I had as a concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5799.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we have two commission members that have done yeoman's work and gone above and beyond, and we see you two everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5809.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5810.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that brings me to the question that I had that we talked about even during the process with the school committee and looking at commissions and boards that we feel that are that important that we have to look at it in different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5824.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, one question I brought up was everybody knows who the two of you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5832.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I asked for a report to say, what is the attendance record for the other members on the commission?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5838.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I think that's important also, just for the fact that if two people are doing the job that realistically a commission of five or seven, we really need dedicated people that, hey, we heard so many people say this so many issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5853.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, then put up a shut up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5856.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And these are the opportunities that we have in our community that come and help the commission and be part of that commission and be part of the commission all in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5864.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a volunteer position, you guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5866.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And for the most part, I've seen the commission, these two members of the commission, very active everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5875.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But for the most part, most other people don't know who the other commissioners are, unless it's election day or they have to be in a certain spot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5886.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's a problem as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5888.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's something that I'll be bringing forward myself because I think that in the totality of commissions and boards that we have in our community, and who's responsible for putting them into place or what they<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5901.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: their weight, their responsibilities of weight, whether it's financial or whether it's weight other ways, maybe, maybe it's, we look at our assessor and say, maybe there's a tax break for residents that have these backgrounds, that we can bring people that are qualified to really support that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5918.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, it's no different than, you know, we have commissions right now that we have nothing in place right now that we have commissions and other boards that don't even live in the city anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5927.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's something I'll look forward to meeting with and try to change those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5930.487s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that's another concern that I have that in totality, this isn't, this is something that we need more, more effort and more support to in every level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5945.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I wanted to share that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5947.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6530.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, to Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6531.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Miller.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6533.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will provide,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6535.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the commissioner with the letter that was sent to the candidate that that morning, what there was said that the votes will be tallied here and posted at eight o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8279.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8281.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8283.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want to say thank you, because I think that this is uncomfortable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8286.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, I think we all mean, we all have the same intention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8290.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think everybody here loves Medford, and there was nothing done with any ill will or intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8298.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that you coming here tonight is a huge step that starts that healing in this, in the fact of those people that I told you about that really affect that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8308.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one's hiding anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8309.822s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're in front of us as a commission and the commissioner and say, hey, this is what we need to do in this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8316.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Look ourselves in the mirror, like my father taught us in his Jesuit schooling, that you always look<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8325.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: at the person that you're looking at and put yourself in their shoes and say, what do you, how would you do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8331.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And make sure you understand the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8334.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that that's why I'm stressing the subcommittees and sitting down and truly being part of it because, you know, even just to hear the fact that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8345.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: while we're going through the process of recount, we still don't have enough staff to still even try to do something to assist them by moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8352.805s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I really do appreciate you coming out tonight and giving us these answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8364.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know what, I would like to bounce here, Justin Singh, for the presidential election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8370.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8371.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, not that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8372.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, no, not that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8373.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not the presidential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8374.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, that's not going to be contentious at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8803.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, so just, I know that some information that, first I want to share, I think that one of the questions was the fees of the structure for the 2024 paraprofessional wage scale pursuant to Method Public Schools from their records of proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8820.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's given the, just for a point of information that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8825.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the kindergarten aids right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8829.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One of the questions was if there was one, one group that one paraprofessional group that was making less than what was going to be asked that this would be this would be a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8840.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that they paraprofessionals stand at $20,500 with their contract ending.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8849.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this year, so they'll be negotiating again as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8852.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I, for one, I will applaud the effort by Councilor Tseng of finding common ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8862.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think you've done your due diligence, I will tell you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8864.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I applaud that immensely for the fact that you listened and you tried to get to a resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8874.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will tell you I will not support it for the fact that I really think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8878.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: until we really know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8879.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think if this resolution and this compromise came after understanding what our budget looks like, even for a dollar, I think that I would support it wholeheartedly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8889.191s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will be honest with you with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8890.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that this is the sense of compromise that I wish that the teachers and paraprofessionals were there moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8896.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that this gives, like you said, I think that this gives our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8903.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: school committee and administration the same, hopefully the same type of attitude and mentality when it comes to supporting and rewarding our teachers that need it the most and that's mostly our paraprofessionals that are getting the short end of the stick right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8917.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8919.582s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, like I said, I want to applaud that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8922.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same time, I think that not knowing our fiscal situation right now is the reason why I can't move forward with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8930.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8932.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And like, again, I'll say it again, that's a very, very well thought compromise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8937.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm sure that the teachers will feel that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8942.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10970.297s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just for point of information, I think that receiving emails and people understanding that just so they're not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10980.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: misplaced or forgotten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10983.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, school custodians have been without a contract for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10988.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our parking department still hasn't had a contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10991.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our inspectorate services have no contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10994.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: DPW superintendents and recreation department have no contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11000.02s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, these are all Teamster positions and other<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11008.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Other positions in the city that it's that dollar figure that's got to come from somewhere, whether we increase it $35,000 or $75,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11024.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it's going to trickle down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11026.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just wanted to make sure that I mentioned that because I did receive emails and support of not forgetting that these very important positions are left without a contract for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11042.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=868.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=871.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think I was pretty clear at our last meeting that where I stood on this topic, I think that there are so many factors to look at this, but looking at this is more prudent and realistic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=889.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: process, when we look in the basic sense of the perfect world, this would be easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=899.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we had unlimited funds, then we would do what we need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=905.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But unfortunately, we're talking about a school system that right now<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=910.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Today is drastically underfunded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=912.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when it comes to next year's fiscal budget, we're gonna be talking about some pretty difficult decisions to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=920.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And those decisions are gonna be, gee, can we afford a language teacher, a foreign language teacher in the middle schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=929.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Where could we find 45, $55,000?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=930.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we could find it right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=936.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's look at the conversations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=939.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, how do we fund these clubs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=942.236s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All these great clubs that we started, these small stipend clubs that teachers do it for service for their children in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=951.822s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How do we fund those?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=952.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because they're gonna be on the chopping block.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=954.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're gonna be cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=957.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the question is gonna be, where do we find $36,000?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=959.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=964.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you listen to my council colleagues, I appreciate the hard work you did, but where was this math when paraprofessionals and teachers are negotiating?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=973.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is, this perception's reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=977.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that it was brought up at the meeting when, I've had a thousand phone calls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=982.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think I've shared it with you people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=984.016s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I want you guys to understand that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=987.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will share what they've said to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=989.779s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The perception of reality that when you have an organization running for office in the city, and they run in a slate, and that slate goes on a gigantic picture all over the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1000.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then as soon as the election is completed, then the word goes out that that organization is now going to support each other to raising funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1010.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's a glaring question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1012.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whether it's true or not, that's not what I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1015.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the perception of what we're trying to do here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1018.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, I've gotten a message from different members of past school committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1024.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've gotten messages from present school committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1027.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the idea of saying, this is equitable, what we do is no different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1032.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Absolutely, it's different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1035.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Absolutely, it's different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1036.18s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And no one can tell me otherwise, because I'm the only one here that has done both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1041.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I will tell you that this position<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1046.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: has way more pressures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1049.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have way more work to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1053.584s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Every single day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1055.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, when you think about it, what is the school committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1058.907s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The school committee is a policy making authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1062.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They set policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1064.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They set policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1066.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They have a superintendent that does all the work, that sets everything in motion to what the vision of this school is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1077.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it working?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1078.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1079.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's still out for debate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1081.792s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the question that I have is understanding this process today and what they're asking for today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1088.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I shared it with my colleagues today, tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1092.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1093.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If the community didn't want this, well, you should have come out to vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1098.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because there are six people from one side and one from another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1103.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the philosophy is very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1105.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is just common sense philosophy of doing the right thing today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1109.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Until we have a better understanding of what our fiscal responsibilities are when it comes to the budget, we should not look at any increases like this at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1119.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's borderline dangerous because what's next?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1125.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I joined the school committee, it was a service-based<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1129.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1130.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was for me to work and give back to my community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1134.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to hear the responses, but we'll get better candidates if we get paid more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1140.168s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Here's a here's a lightning rod to everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1143.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We make $28,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1143.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not I'm not I'm not getting rich over $28,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1148.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if the fantasy is a school kid member sending me messages saying that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1153.223s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, it'll bring in better candidates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1155.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've worked on a school committee with great candidates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1158.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've worked for school committee members that we couldn't shine their shoes and how dedicated they were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1167.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they weren't getting a penny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1169.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was a volunteer basic process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1173.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Neighborhood communities, because I did some homework too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1177.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're asking for here is an absolute disgrace to what neighboring communities just around us get.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1184.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Some of those are the highest, and I think that they're bordering between $16,000 and $18,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1188.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1190.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1191.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are some communities that, when I brought it up, they were like, what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1194.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are you crazy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1197.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To equate it as the same responsibility as what we do here is different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1203.494s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1205.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1209.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It just looks and it feels funny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1213.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I look at the situation that we're in tonight, when we're bringing this up, and we understand the voting process now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1219.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know some of the council wanna know where we're gonna go next with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1223.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that, you know, is there something that we can do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1227.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, you hear that the equity piece is being thrown around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1232.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If that's the biggest issue, then let's correct it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1236.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we make 28 and they make 12, well then why don't we all pull together, not jeopardize the funding mechanism, what we don't have at the high school right now and drop our pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1251.574s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1253.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't do it for applause or social media comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1255.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm dead serious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1257.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I started in 2008, when I ran for office, I did it because I wanted to give back to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1262.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1264.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've stood in there, I've stuck in there pretty long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1266.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've learned a lot and I've done a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1268.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm pretty satisfied that my legacy, that what I put forth to this community is something strong that my kids will look at and say, well, my dad was part of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1278.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what it's all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1280.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you're doing this, we're doing this for the money, we're in big trouble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1286.274s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if that's a reality of what this body thinks of what is a successful financial situation in your homes, this isn't it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1296.842s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I truly, I would make the motion that we look at all of our salaries and become equitable by dropping our salaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1306.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if the city council school committee, if that's the biggest issue, then let's do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1311.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't something I'm not listen, it's not going to make or break me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1316.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I tell people it's just 8000 less than I'd have to donate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1320.911s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm sure all of you feel the same way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1322.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think anybody here if you've been here for a while, have seen where your money goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1326.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Your money doesn't go to fancy cars, doesn't go to fancy houses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1330.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It usually goes back to the people that helped you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1335.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what we're all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1337.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we sit here and talk about 100 and whatever percent raise increase, I think it's disingenuine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1343.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to be honest with you, I think it's a slap in the face for the people that are really having a very difficult time right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1350.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The morale in the school department is still terrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1353.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's still terrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1356.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our scores are very low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1358.663s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, we're in flux in many different areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1363.427s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our school facilities look terrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1366.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our custodians still don't have, if they've settled a contract, it's gonna be lower than ever, or they haven't either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1373.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you still have unions out there that work every single day, that are doing the dirtiest, most disgusting work in the city, and with a smile on their face, picking up kids and hugging them after they vomit all over them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1387.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same time, oh, people are gonna offend that I said that, but by the way, kids vomit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1392.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we shouldn't be offended by that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1396.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because, and this is funny, because the other piece of this is, I've heard from teachers, I've heard from teachers, qualified, respected, long-term educators in our system, that have been absolutely torn down<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1414.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: by administrators and school kid members because they've come to that podium and raised an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1421.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a disgrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1423.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is their podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1425.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're taking care of our children, whether they live in Medford or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1428.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're more of this community than most people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1433.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So listen, we realize, and I think everybody has to realize this, the vote's gonna be the vote, and we have to move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1440.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think, in good faith,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1443.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this council can work together to show the community, can we be responsible?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1448.792s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can we send the right message?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1450.714s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And is the right message to give an increase at this amount?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1454.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1455.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do I think that that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1458.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and in reality of life that we haven't touched there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1461.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They haven't, the school committee hasn't gotten an increase since I believe, yeah, I was there in 2008 and eight, six years before that, we didn't get that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1469.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I tell you what, George Scarpelli didn't care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1471.969s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Ann Marie Cuno didn't care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1473.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Paulette Van der Kloot didn't care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1475.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Billy O'Keefe didn't care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1476.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: John Falco didn't care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1478.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mayor Michael J. McGlynn didn't care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1480.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We went to work every day for our city and we did a lot of great things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1485.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So be careful what we do, because once we open this can, guess what's going to happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1489.65s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you know how many committees, commissions we have in this city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1494.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What's to say we can't look at what they're doing and saying, well, we've got to compensate them now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1500.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So careful of what we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1503.18s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we, like I said, if we had an abundance of funds, then maybe we can look at and working it together and try to build it up slowly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1511.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we're talking about, and we all heard it, everybody heard it, let's all be realist here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1516.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The next year's budget, when we sit together, when we lose ESSER money, and we look at what the ARPA money we've lost, and we look at the positions that those funds hold for us, we're gonna be in deep, deep trouble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1531.553s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm gonna tell you, I'm like, listen, I've only, I know I could speak, but I've told you guys, I've really pushed in things that I've seen just by being part of this community for so long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1546.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You saw how it worked with the city solicitors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1549.005s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You saw how it worked with the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1551.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's just not equitable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1553.868s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Be smart, be prudent, and use common sense with these issues when I say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1561.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe it's not fair, but they ran.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1565.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They ran for office at $12,000 as a payee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1569.171s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what they ran for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1572.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's what they should have until we make sure we know what our fiscal future looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1579.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1580.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all I ask this committee to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1584.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Callan asked a question that, where do we go from here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1587.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What's the process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1588.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would hope this is still a feeling of process, because the truth of the matter is, when you have an employee, because that's what it seems like to me, when you have an employee that's come to you for a raise, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1599.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm assistant director of a program, and I've had employees come to me and say, George, I think I deserve a raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1604.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said, you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1606.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's sit down and talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1609.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's sit down at your body of work and let's sit down and talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1612.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have any of you talked to any of the school kid members?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1615.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, you've talked to all the school kid members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1620.01s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Don't say it, careful, because you don't talk to all the school kid members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1624.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if you really want to do some homework, you've talked to all the school kid members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1629.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my recommendation would be to have the school kid members here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1634.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and let's talk with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1636.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I think when you put it together and you understand, and maybe you sit and look at people eye to eye and you say, well, this is how it hurts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1643.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Here's the reality of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1645.177s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The school committee knows how bad the budget is gonna be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1647.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's be serious, they know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1649.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you look in the school committee's eyes and say, okay, your child goes to the Brooks, your child has kindergarten AIDS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1657.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With this increase, this could be the increase that avoids kindergarten AIDS next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1664.64s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what I'm trying to say because listen, I taught for 15 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1669.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was on the school committee for eight years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1671.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been on this committee for six years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1674.169s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand how all the balls are being juggled right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1679.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please don't make something that looks good on paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1683.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have you make a decision because ultimately, the decisions we make tonight will affect what we do<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1691.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in June, in July, in August, and in September, more importantly, in such a negative manner that it will hurt us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1701.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1702.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's just the reality of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1703.969s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2378.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To the personal privilege, just to Councilor Lazzaro, when you use a person's name, and understanding what I did when I ran for office, and I was a school kid member,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2391.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We worked our tail off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2393.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We changed policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2395.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We put in bullying policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2397.539s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We made sure we had new science labs, new fields, new gymnasium, new curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2405.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we worked our tails off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2406.745s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And by the way, while this council was doing that, he owned a fence company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2412.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He owned a painting company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2414.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He worked as a coach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2416.571s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and he worked as a full-time recreation assistant director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2420.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I completely understand how hard it is to want to be part of a position, but when you use the name like you did and understand, I don't know what you did or what school department you work for, but I made reference to the school committee, the teaching and the city council work that I've done in this community, in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2445.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate that you have an overview of what happens in another- It was Medford, actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2453.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, in Medford, but I truly didn't even know you worked in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2459.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3563.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, first, I think the point of information is for clarity purposes, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3568.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not, as we move forward, we're not tying in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3571.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the increase if this passes with the school committee, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3575.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not, it's not, it wouldn't be voted by the school committee because in essence that would be a conflict of interest, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3581.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It would be something that if we do, if we do vote yes to this, that the increase would have to come from the council every year after that or put into place now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3592.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: at that time, because I think it's a conflict of interest if we're having the school committee voting on something that's going to be on the same line as the teacher's contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3601.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a confusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3602.304s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all I want to clarify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3644.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for that, Claire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3644.999s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3646.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My motion would be that the City Council lower their rate of pay<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3654.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the school board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3655.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To uh, equitable rate for the school committee and then follow Council sayings or, uh, process of compensation moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3665.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3666.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3668.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With the, uh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3670.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The fiscal<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3681.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: our concerns and issues from all sides to be on level playing field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3686.115s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's not a political ploy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3688.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that I feel strongly about, that if this is a wrong and we wanna make it right, let's make it right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3695.142s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3778.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, it would be taking our salaries, pulling together an all-stop level playing field, roughly 20,000, whatever the math comes up and then go up and then go up with what the process would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4602.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information, point of information, Councilor Villescaz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4606.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hate to interrupt,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4608.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If this is true, have anybody filed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4610.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because this is serious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4617.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was spoken to by the head of the paraprofessionals union.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4621.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, this is one of the issues that I heard myself, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7701.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council President Washington is searching, can I just make a comment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7706.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was something that was passed by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7707.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that as a, as a former coach of 32 years, I didn't realize that coaches haven't been paid, haven't got an increase in 20 years as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7716.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that might be something that, um, we should remember just for the budget process, because I think all of us realize the importance that they, they play in our lives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7726.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know it's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7728.186s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A lot of those coaches have been there for 20 years, you know, a coach like Louis Jerry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=122.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Isaac B. Zachary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=681.714s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Kit Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1240.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Could we suspend the rules to take papers 2-4-0-1-2, 0-1-3, 0-1-4, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1277.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1279.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's sad to add a few resolutions and for passing some pretty important people here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1288.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: James Jack McDevitt was an amazing person, an amazing teacher, and someone who really loved the law and loved the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1302.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. McDevitt,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1305.868s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I remember in high school, Mr. McDevitt started, I believe it was the Method Co-op Bank inside Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1314.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we had a work program where we actually ran a bank out of the school that was run by students at Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1323.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1325.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was so involved in making sure that he taught the most important classes, and his view were law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1333.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he was, I believe, a Triple Eagle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1337.65s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He loved his BC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1340.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had the honor of being at his wake tonight, and he would be laid to rest with his BC hat right next to him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1347.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and he leaves behind, he joins his wife in heaven, but he leaves three great sons and Michael, Mark, and Chris to leave and share his legacy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1361.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So may you rest in peace and we bless him and wish the family well, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1395.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1396.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you again, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1399.231s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Judith Granara,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1401.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: was a very special person here in Medford, a lifelong resident here in Medford, a former school teacher in the Method Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1410.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Her husband, John, has done so much for our city, and the Granara family has given so much to the city of Medford, and her passing will daily be missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1420.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that she leaves her son, John Jr., and her daughter, Kelly, and I wish their family<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1430.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and we pray for their family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1432.764s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1450.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1452.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Ernie's a little more personal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1454.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Ernie Artelino passed away<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1458.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: After a brief illness, Ernie was a Mustang Hall of Famer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1464.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Ernie wasn't the biggest person in stature, but he went off to University of Miami, played football and baseball for the Hurricanes, and came back and started a teaching and coaching career that's helped so many young men and women achieve their dreams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1484.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had the privilege of coaching with Ernie, and I learned as a young coach the importance of making sure you never, ever, ever treat a female athlete as a nefarious ex.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1499.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He made sure that we elevated every single athlete that he coached.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1505.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he used to tell me, he says, coach,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1508.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: look at your athletes, not your female and male athletes, look at your athletes and treat them accordingly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1514.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're no different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1515.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a matter of fact, he used to say they were stronger, our female athletes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1519.698s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, you know, it was a different time back then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1523.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the legacy that he's left behind, I remember walking through his wake and former athletes, former basketball players, and some of the girls were there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1534.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to that evening,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1537.202s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they would visit Ernie in the hospital and they would tell me the stories that Ernie still, the impacts that Ernie made in their lives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1545.91s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he really understood what we're fighting for today and equality for gender.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1552.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was, he saw something that most coaches didn't back then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1556.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I, I, I attribute my successes as a coach because I was around Ernie Adelino.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1564.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1566.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Ernie had his own language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1567.379s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When he wanted to talk bad about someone, he made up a language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1570.541s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it wasn't that he was talking bad about someone, it's because he forgot their names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1574.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we'd call him, hey, Frappeterra.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1576.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we didn't know, we said, what is he saying when I first started coaching?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1579.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He says, George, Ernie forgets his keys and people's names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1582.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And because he had so many kids now, he taught it out to Catholic for many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1587.494s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think his biggest joy is that he leaves his daughter, Diane and Laurie,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1593.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: his pride, Ernie Jr.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1595.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and his daughter, Elena.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1596.92s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we wish the family the best because we talk, I hate to be the one that keeps saying this, but when we lose legends, it really, it really affects our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1609.148s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And Ernie was a true legend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1610.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these are three people that played a big part in the framework of what Medford is today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1617.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1619.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are three people that will surely be missed, so I thank you, Mr. President, for allowing me to speak and wish their families the best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1952.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1953.553s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Miss Lee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1954.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, we did have mailings come in for a change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1959.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1960.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've been unbelievable owners so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1965.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't see any changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1966.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that there was never an issue with the hours of operations with the former owner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1972.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would move forward with the request that is offered by the Mailings Corporation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1980.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then if we can just have a 30 and 60 day review, just to make sure that we have no<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1987.532s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No issues within that two-month time frame, midnight move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=2953.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: appreciate the movement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=2954.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is someone that's been around for 16 years now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=2960.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It seems that it's more streamlined, and I think it keeps us on task.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=2965.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that, you know, as transparent as can be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=2968.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think what's important, though, I think what Councilor Tseng brought up, I think it's important that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=2974.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the shared goals and visions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=2975.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that was probably one of our most important meetings whenever we start our new terms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=2979.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's sitting together as a group, because we're going to all understand that we're going to agree to disagree on, if not some, but many issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=2990.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think having the respect of each other and understanding each other's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=2997.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: each other's goals, and I think it sends that understanding for each other that I didn't realize how important I'll use Councilor Bears' initiatives with traffic and why that's so important to him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3012.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when you understand why traffic issues are so important for a personal reason for Councilor Bears, you realize as a human being why<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3022.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you need to really understand and take those initiatives in for more of a personal level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3027.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, you know, as someone who's always been involved in youth services in the city of Medford and bringing the recreation department as a full-time, I take a lot of pride and passion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3039.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's something that Councilor Tseng and I have been talking about is starting, introducing a youth summit to really get our youth involved and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3047.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: really helping them mold what they want to see the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3051.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so I think that having that meeting, I think it's probably the most important meeting we'll have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3058.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate my new Councilors that reached out after they were elected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3063.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, it's the banter goes back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3066.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that it was an interesting election season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3070.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same time, we all realize that it's an election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3075.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you're going to get down and dirty sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3077.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same time, now that we're here behind this real, we're going to work together to do some great things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3083.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know I joke a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3085.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, you know, when I first came in,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3088.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I joked at the fact that I got so many people calling me wishing me luck, but I truly, truly can say everybody that's behind this rail are very good people and we all have the same mission and that's to make Medford the best city we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3104.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3106.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the changes already Council presidents put into place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3109.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will tell you, there'll be some kickback a little in some things, but I enjoy doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3115.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And for that next meeting that I think that we sit together as a team and vet those, I think it's gonna be very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3125.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3873.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3876.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, I don't have a PhD in organization, so this, if you could just do, if we can, if I could just ask for one favor, I think that as we're going public with this and people start looking, I think that one of the easier formats that we see on our website are our subcommittees and how that was formatted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3895.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can add, and ask Council President, if we can add<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3900.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: where, especially with the first document, as we're starting this process, that we can add maybe a little section that shows this would, in the past, fall under this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3913.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So people can truly understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3915.105s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if you look at this, I understand it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3917.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as we're going through the process, saying, OK, now I understand where it falls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3921.407s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think as we're talking about having that transparent form of government, where the common person is going to look on, they have an issue, and they have to speak<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3929.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: where the the language has been for years a subcommittee on science where there isn't a subcommittee on science but there is a committee that is under rules and permits if that's the way so be it so if there could be maybe a little disclaimer that says in the past this was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3946.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: these were the subcommittees that fell into this category.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3949.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can do that just to, especially as we get started, I think that this document will be no different in a year or two, the people just understand it better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3957.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think if we can have a little disclaimer there that shows the common person what they're looking at, so they can, that have revert back looking at, you know, the subcommittees that we've had in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3968.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So at least they understand where it's going, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3971.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can do that, that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=3973.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd appreciate that, Council President, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4013.148s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think the structure is no different, but I think what I'm seeing is you're welcoming everybody in where the former subcommittees were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4021.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was in the point where, in the past, I can't show up because I don't want to disrespect that chairperson because I'm actually not on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4030.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think what we're seeing is a more open, inviting subcommittee process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4035.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same time, it's not so, and for the newer members, I think that to be stated,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4042.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We all have families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4044.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If everybody's going to show up to five different meetings a week, that's a little overwhelming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4048.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same time, I like the idea that it's open for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4052.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because in the past, it didn't lend to that congeniality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4056.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We were just like, I don't want to show up because.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4059.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to disrespect the chairperson because it's not my committee, thinking that I want to interject my thought process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4067.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the way that Council Biaz has structured this, I think it's appreciated, because I think it shows that it's a welcoming committee, but at the same time, it's understood that we still have to have the groundwork as subcommittees and chairs and voices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4085.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4086.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry to interrupt, but I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4088.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: little history that we've seen in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4092.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5561.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5565.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, they bring this forward and explaining it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5568.079s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that the phone calls I was getting was joy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5570.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so George.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5572.671s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I wave hi to my neighbor, am I good?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5574.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, please, I said just, but I think that it's important that we understand where it's coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5581.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that I appreciate that it's going to the assessor just to understand the ramifications because although the best laid plans sound great, but I think we all have to, when we make decisions is also understand that if there are,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5602.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what does it look like if we have 10 landlords that are going to do this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5608.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How does this affect, you know, the other balance with our tax bracket and see how that affects us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5616.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that, you know, love the idea, especially when we see, you know, as a former, you know, resident of a home that was owned by a resident of Medford,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5633.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and that being my dad and making sure that he never took advantage of his tenants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5640.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we know in his passing, he promised my brothers he took over the home to make sure that the families are there, we'll always have a place to live.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5649.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that that's a reward that people like to have that open mind to see because I think like, as Councilor Cowen said, we have, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5660.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the homes and the landlords that really take advantage, railing out those people that live here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5665.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, but I think it's something that I think needs to be vetted, and I appreciate that going to the subcommittee so we can see where this goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5673.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6257.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People don't know, but I was Justin's favorite teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6262.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was crazy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6339.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, I know Mr. Merritt's been actively, I know the neighbors have reached out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6344.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that the question that has been put out there, the mayor did address it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6350.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I could share the email with everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6353.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was hoping to get some clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6356.827s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what I would like to do is call for a meeting with that state representative because in this email the mayor clearly states that it's really that she doesn't believe I think that it falls in her privy to hold this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6367.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She thinks really it needs our state delegates to really explain what's going on so if I can read it so you absolutely that'd be great thank you if you can so it's uh it's an update for temporary shelter update from the mayor<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6379.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hello, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6380.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wanted to provide an update in the last email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6382.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The humanitarian crisis unfolding in our region.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6386.34s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We believe the state is moving forward with the facility at 400 Riverside to serve as a temporary overnight shelter for families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6393.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My office, along with our Acting Building Commissioner, Fire Chief and Board of Health, Emergency Response Director, have outlined our concerns as well as our code requirements to ensure that the governor's administration ensures a safe and secure environment for families currently in the state's wait list<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6409.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for emergency assistance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6410.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm working toward reaching an MOU to set a clear limit on the number of people housed at the facility as well as capping the duration of each family's stay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6420.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The reasons being the facility is very large and could fit thousands because three of our elementary schools are already at capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6426.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My ask of that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6429.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Schools are already capacity that this be for no more than 75 families, 250 people, which is what was the original plan for the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6438.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The shelter is active until April or June, and the latest based on legislators, recent legislation, that the families rotate into permanent shelter within three to four days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6450.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, these are just my asks, and there are no specifics for report out of the public yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6455.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To date there is no lease agreement in place with the owner of 400 Riverside, no contract with the health and services provider, and as I said, no MOU.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6468.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in place with the city, so there are a few details that can be shared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6472.209s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As you may have read, the state is moving forward and has already opened the Cambridge site, which took priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6478.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As soon as I am fully briefed by the state in specifics and operations terms upon Riverside, I will relay<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6487.553s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Excuse me, that info to you all as well as the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6491.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Ultimately, this is a state-run endeavor in the relationship with a private entity, and we ultimately have very little say and have no oversight on the day-to-day operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6500.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My only hope is that the MOU can be reached and signed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6503.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If there is any community meetings, it would have to be done by the state officials running the system and the building owner and provider as we don't have much involvement or insight into how this process unfolds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6516.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's from the mayor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6518.165s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's from the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6519.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6521.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the mayor also understands the impact of our infrastructure, that making sure that we don't overburden our system right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6530.571s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I've heard a lot from the teachers and the fear from parents, especially in that neighborhood between the Roberts and the McGlynn and the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6540.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's very, very, very, very tight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6544.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And although we understand that we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6548.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, the governor wants to look at options, but again, I think my hope is that I get an update from the mayor again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6560.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor's been responsive, but I think at the same time, I think we need to have our state delegates here and all of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6567.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we need to have an understanding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6570.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that if this is going to happen, which it looks like it's going to happen, that we're prepared in every which way possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6576.64s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because you can understand if it was three to four days, and then we're moving to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6581.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I don't see many guarantees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6583.171s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I heard from friends in Cambridge,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6585.698s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's really not being used as a three or four day Passover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6589.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's really being used for families that are being housed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6592.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to be honest with you, from what I gather, it's not a conducive environment for families either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6598.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, granted, it's safer maybe, it's warmer maybe, but I think that if this is the governor's wish, we have to look at a long-term commitment to housing the families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6614.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, we've heard a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6615.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've talked to a lot of different communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6618.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we don't see a lot of the more affluent communities that have a lot of money that they're asking to move these families, communities that have access, that have space in their schools, that have infrastructure that can support that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6636.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it seems like they're really coming into more of the urban rim and urban communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6641.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: over exhausting their infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6644.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think the mayor and all her department that see that for the fact that this is, you know, whether you're for it or against it, that's not the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6653.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The biggest issue right now is making sure that we can handle that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6658.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we can, Mr. Merritt, I know that you've been on the forefront.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6661.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wanted to make sure I read that on on the record, but then at the same time for our next meeting, we should call for a meeting because we don't know what two weeks will come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6669.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If this is going to happen, at least let's hear it from the state representatives and see where we're going from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6686.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Inviting all of us state representatives and city administration to give us an understanding of what the process I know the mayor has given us some information, but at the same time, I think if we can have someone from her her department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6699.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and the state delegates that can come in and support us in understanding what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6704.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're not going back and forth, and we hear it directly from them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6893.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that's the common word I've heard from the residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=6896.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think anybody's opposing anything, but I think understanding the process, so there's preparation and understanding to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7500.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate you coming up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7502.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that you've been the lone wolf for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7508.311s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've had many discussions about this, and even in Somerville, I know that this is something that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7515.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I truly thought of the process that that was done, that the track was a new track.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7525.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My daughter played basketball, so it looked like the surface was done, but I didn't realize it was the same type of issues that we've had in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7534.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the big call right now is getting the approval to be on the list now for the new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7544.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just don't, there might, you know, if there's something that you brought up an alarming situation when you talk about safety, it's something that you have to look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7553.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, it's, when even, this is the catch 22 that you came to our forum because you can speak in our forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7564.233s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7565.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We appreciate you doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7567.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think there's got to be, unfortunately, the way that's come up, we can't deliberate or send anything out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7572.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think this is again, that this is something that I personally make a call tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7577.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Brown, I'll talk, I'll talk to the superintendent tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7581.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll try to make a phone call tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7584.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and then find a way to maybe put it on their agenda on the school side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7588.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if there is something that is something we have to look at for next year and Medford and the track really isn't safe, then we have to look at alternative sites to support the student athletes that maybe you look at a Reggie Lewis Center to book practice space and time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7609.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, until you figure out a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7611.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that that's something that we need to get more information from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7615.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7616.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm going to call the superintendent tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7618.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll call the athletic director tomorrow and get some better understanding of what their process is and what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7624.69s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So maybe we can help move you along and give you some insight to help you with this, because it pains me to see you back up here for the same situations over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7635.532s">[Scarpelli]</a>: sad because I think with the loss of Mr. Maskell, I think he was probably the last advocate for track and field, really, true advocate of track and field at Medford High.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7648.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, whatever I can do, I'll lend my support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7651.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I know that Somerville does have a new floor, but they're having their own issues as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7658.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they have to close it at the end of the school year because of the way that it was put down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7664.681s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So throughout the summer, they have to close it to put in industrial humidifiers in there so it doesn't pop up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7672.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's issues everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7674.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7676.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, for this situation, you brought up safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7678.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For me, that's something that can't be overlooked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7681.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So for one person, I'll look at how's the president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7685.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll reach out to the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7687.016s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if there's something I'll request for her to do, if she can, is put it on the next agenda so you can go and speak to the authorities that need to push that along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7695.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7697.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if it's something that we need assistance from this body that can ask the mayor for some funding if there is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7705.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that has to support our kids that are in a situation like that, because it'd be interesting to see what the athletic trainer has for documentation and data that says how many kids have been ACLs, MCLs, you know, different injuries that happen on different type of surfaces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7731.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the thing, data drives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7807.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, well, like I said, I think that we're looking at, you know, a few years back, a grassroot organization came to me and said, would you be willing to help in a little project called the Field of Dreams?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7819.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they said, no, there's no way you want to put turf fields behind Bedford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7823.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's all it needs sometimes, just discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7827.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And like you said, there are avenues out there that we can tap into if that's the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7831.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate you coming out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7833.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the right now it's the first thing you had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7835.692s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have to do tonight is understand that there's an issue so we can move forward on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=7839.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=673.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=673.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Dasch, I know that one of the questions that was brought forth was the turnaround for the fire truck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=678.293s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was a big issue, but that was resolved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=680.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=681.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I think the biggest issue is really moving this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=684.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something that I believe what the family had mentioned at the beginning, that it was a hardship due to a family member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=691.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's the reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=692.477s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=695.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know my fellow counsel is going to table it, so he allowed me to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=700.29s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would move it on the vote, but obviously I don't think it will have the vote, so I just think that we have a new council coming in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=710.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that if we can bring them up to speed and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=715.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: hope for the first meeting in January we get this passed, because this is, I still don't, I don't see why it's an issue that we can't move this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=723.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because it seems like in good faith, we're, we're, we're going above and beyond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=727.575s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, I look at this in a sense that we're kind of holding the Alps hostage here, in a sense that we're, you know, what we're asking them to do, we're going above and beyond right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=738.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it seems like the city has really, really just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=743.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: waste a lot of people's time not getting the answers to the right people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=747.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To hear the fact the mayor hasn't even seen this yet is a little bothersome to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=751.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That to me is just, you know, no disrespect in any way, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=756.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: attorneys are expensive, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=758.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And everybody has to make a living.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=761.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we're talking about amount of time that's being spent by the Alice family to try to get this push forward for a good reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=767.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And in even having the open dialogue and doing something that I know I wouldn't do, I wouldn't, you know, allow myself to sort of be bullied to try to make this happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=779.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This should be something our community should be looking to assist each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=783.071s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=785.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: know, I just I'm a little confused why we can't move this forward in the sense of a time sensitive situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=791.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but I'll leave it at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=794.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1614.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1615.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If Council Vice President would entertain, could we add something to the motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1624.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to get the attendance record for all of the members on the Election Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1629.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1630.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I think that's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1632.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, from what I gather, we don't have too many members that are actually committed to that commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1638.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't think we're taking it as serious as we should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1641.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My biggest piece with this situation is accountability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1645.268s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've seen very, very good people be marched out that door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1649.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But not even a quarter of the concerns that we've we've<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1658.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or understand any process that has gone on is a disgrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1665.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I haven't heard from one commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1667.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I haven't heard from anybody except for the coordinator who sent us a message saying that the election is now certified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1679.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And like Councilor Caraviello said, my biggest problem is when I was a young man, when I was in high school, everybody had a mandatory class called civics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1693.313s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you learned about our government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1694.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You learned about the respect you should give this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1702.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I still remember my son just left a minute ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1704.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about how Mrs. Lasky ran the fourth grade presidential election in her classroom and how important everything was and how organized everything should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1716.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wish Mrs. Lasky ran this last election because Councilor Caraviello again is right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1722.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When people don't want to vote,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1724.636s">[Scarpelli]</a>: good people, good hardworking people that took pride in coming to that ballot box every municipal election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1733.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've looked me in the eye and said, they'll never vote again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1736.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They have no faith.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1738.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I truly thought that maybe coming out ahead of this could have helped that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1744.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But instead, we just fed into the rhetoric.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1747.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said it the day that we had the first issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1749.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said, what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1750.868s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said, be careful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1752.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because perception is reality and it's exactly what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1759.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So moving forward, I know that we'll have a new council, but I think as this council looks to move people forward and look at our budgetary processes, we have to start looking for people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1773.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If the city administration is not going to hold people accountable, then we're going to have to make sure that they<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1778.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that they know that this council is going to be strong enough to make sure they hold their people to the feet of the fire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1784.827s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because this has been an absolute laughingstock across the commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1790.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the fact, I'll be honest with you, I'm disgusted with the Secretary of State's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1797.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Reached out to them, haven't heard anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1802.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what they're all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1804.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If this is what the Secretary of State and our governor sees that that's appropriate, look what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1812.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a trickle-down effect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1813.91s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, who knows how many people aren't going to come out for the next elections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1819.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1820.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one's told us anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1821.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one's even talked to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1823.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I got a bunch of fluffy, I'm getting a lot of emails, fluffy emails, you know, wishing me luck, a happy birthday, a congratulations, but no one is still from that commission's talked to me about, George, this is what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1838.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they're good people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1842.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then for the recount, I know I wasn't there, but I,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1847.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I talked to a few people that came here, gave their time to help with the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1853.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I heard our coordinator, our elections coordinator was verbally getting in people's faces and disrespecting people to the point where the attorney from the from the candidate side had to step in and say, Please do not address any of our people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1872.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Talk to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1874.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a disgrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1878.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's a lot more that's going to go on in that meeting when they come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1882.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But my biggest thing right now is, and a lot of people that have talked to him on every side, every side, this isn't just, you know, the George Scarpelli side, this is every side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1893.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody's watching to see where the accountability pieces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1898.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what everybody's waiting to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1901.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if you want to give them benefit of the doubt until the January 29.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1904.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1907.705s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if you're gonna come up to that podium on January 29th and give us fluff, be prepared, because this one Councilor is gonna ask some serious questions, and I'm gonna be calling people out directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1922.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President, and I rest my case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2615.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It says, temporary shelter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2616.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hello, representatives, senators, members of Medford City Council, Medford School Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2620.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wanted to give you all a heads up on an ever-evolving matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2624.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At the end of last week, I was informed that 400 Riverside Ave was being explored.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2629.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as a possible temporary winter emergency shelter for migrant families on the wait list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2634.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The state was only going to pick one site from my recollection on a phone call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2640.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The families would only each stay a few nights before they would be transitioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2645.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The shelter was going to run through April and start with those families currently staying at 10 Park Plaza and may build up to no more than 75 families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2656.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The state, excuse me, 75, the state asked for a walkthrough today, and at the time, the Commissioner Rice relayed different terms to us, all regarding capacity and length of stay through June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2669.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He also said that this was the site they plan to try to move forward with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2674.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have another call with the state tomorrow to try to get more clarity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2679.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is 110,000 square foot site that meets the needs of the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2684.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm worried about the burden it will cause with city staff, the school department, and et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2690.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It reaches the capacity that we are unable to handle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2694.429s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will follow up with you when we have more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2697.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was on 12-5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2699.794s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is, I thought this was public record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2702.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't realize that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2703.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't know that no one else knew it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2705.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the first time that I heard that no one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2706.78s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, I'm sorry, I don't have Facebook, but yeah, this isn't Facebook, but I would assume diagonally across.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2711.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I would assume we should have a.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2714.486s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We should call for a community meeting immediately, maybe somewhere in that area that we can let our neighbors know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2721.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because from what I gather, it doesn't sound like the mayor's supporting this either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2726.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if this is something on the state level, I think it's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2730.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the biggest thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2732.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I heard this, I talked to a couple of teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2736.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they were confused because they<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2739.747s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the increase in numbers in the elementary school, especially kindergarten level, I guess they've added an extra kindergarten to every single school already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2747.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there was some thought that we've already let families in, and that's the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2753.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if that isn't the issue,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2754.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the fear from our educators that any influx, now remember, anybody that moves into our community as a child, they have every right to go to school in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2766.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is gonna put a huge burden, a burden that I don't think that can meet the capacity<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2771.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we offer right now, both at the McGlynn and the Roberts for sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2775.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know if the other schools have space from what I was told that there aren't many places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2781.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, the other issue we heard was with the closure of the Salem Street Fire Station back in our area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2789.183s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I say our area because we grew up in North Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2791.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The idea of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2793.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: any more an influx of this magnitude with only one true station that's on that side, really, other than coming from the main station and then the heights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2804.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's really going to play an impact with public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2807.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's a lot of issues here that I appreciate you bringing this forward today because I think that it's scary at many different levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2815.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, like I said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2818.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when I gather the mayor is really confused with this whole situation as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2822.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So not to support her in any way and understanding it, but this is something that one thing we should do is have community meeting or something should go out saying what she just said in this email that I personally thought because this is a public record, I thought it was already out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2840.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I didn't know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2841.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2842.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wish I knew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2911.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is why it's an issue, because I took that as that they changed that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2918.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The original phone call was for temporary, and then it was extended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2922.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm looking at it totally different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2924.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's why, I think having some clarity, I think that's why really just having some clarity from the main office I think would be important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3285.548s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3287.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's difficult for me because when you spend so much time in people, it's not just every other Tuesday now, or it was every Tuesday, but my first two phone calls on the way to work every morning was to Councilor Caraviello, then to Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3310.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I want to applaud you, Rick, is for teaching all of us to understand why we do what we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3319.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think people have forgotten that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3321.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think last meeting was a pretty good indication of where we were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3327.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Rick Caraviello, the Rick Caraviello I know, no one understands how much you've done for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3337.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What's great about a person that does things, hey, listen, it's great when the camera's in your face, people taking pictures of people talking about you, and you're standing up and shaking hands and cutting ribbon, because I know a lot of people that do that and love it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3349.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's all ego-driven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3351.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the Rick Caraviello I know, that I'm honored to call my friend, has always done things behind the scenes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3358.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I've always admired that about you, Rick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3361.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've tried to emulate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3363.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's very difficult to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3366.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: while running a family and running a business and taking care of dad that's in a home and understanding everything that goes on in a person's life, you still have time to feed the hungry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3383.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You still have time to build a deck for a person that can't afford a handicap ramp.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3391.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When a veteran needs something, it's Rick Caraviello they call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3397.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I used to be, to be honest, I was so jealous of how you did that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3402.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, but it also made me proud that I've learned from the best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3408.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've sat behind this rail with some amazing people, some amazing people that when I sit and talk about all these different people than our lifetimes that have lost, we've lost, and they've moved on to the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3422.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the big Mustang land in the sky, I look at it and I say, who's going to take that place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3429.768s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I was fortunate because I see people like Councilor Marks and Councilor Falco and Councilor Knight and you being the Mount Rushmore of that group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3451.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to get emotional because I think that this is more than just you've given enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3456.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Zach is right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3458.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When it came, when you saw the city falling, no one else had the guts to stand up and you stood up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3466.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You stood up taller than any man I've ever seen in my life other than my dad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3474.045s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You didn't hide from anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3475.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You fought every single day to make things right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3482.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm honored to be your friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3484.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I hope I can make those phone calls in the morning still.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3490.233s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And sometimes I think Dina gets jealous because I don't pick up her call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3495.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'd say, I'm on the phone with Carvey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3499.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But she knows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3500.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So for your family, people that I love, Carol, you've been amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3507.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to make sure Rick is here with us, and I don't think he's ever missed a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3512.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if I missed a meeting, I'd always get an email, a text message right away saying, where are you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3517.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I felt guilty to say, my God, Rick, I'm stuck at work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3520.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because no matter what, even after the election, he was still here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3523.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even after the election, people are still calling him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3525.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was at the door the other day, and I was like, after the election, and I said, what are you doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3533.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He had a truck full of turkeys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3535.236s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He says, do you know anybody who needs a turkey, any family that needs a turkey?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3540.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what I'm talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3541.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what we're going to miss in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3543.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People don't realize that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3544.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's something that when I see your grandchildren, I make sure they know how proud they should be of their papa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3552.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And Rick, you've done an amazing job to set a standard for the Caraviello family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3557.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my friend, all I can say to you is I wish one day George Scarpelli leaves a legacy like Rick Caraviello, because it's not Armin anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3568.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All Armin did was win a few football games.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3571.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Rick Caraviello is what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3575.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we should all aspire to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3577.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will miss you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3579.487s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate everything you've taught me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3581.928s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've appreciated you, the phone calls that you've, you've called me and set me straight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3586.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I was going to go stray, you pulled me back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3589.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I hope I still get those phone calls because we know it's not going to be easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3594.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: President Zach Beers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3596.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Imagine Ricky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3602.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Joking, of course, but I love you, my friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3605.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm proud that this journey in our lives made us brothers and I thank you and I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3614.34s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3615.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5406.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I think that it's tough when it's one person that leaves, but when it's two, it's really tough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5419.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5419.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5421.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Someone that I've worked with, I mean, for a long time now, so I apologize, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5428.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Believe me, I have your speech ready, so I hope you have tissues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5434.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I love listening to kid laugh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5437.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you ever notice that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5438.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's my mission in life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5440.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, it's my mission in life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5441.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I just want everybody to realize, I think that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5449.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You might not agree with him a thousand percent of the time you might get irritated with him Sometimes he does it with a subtle rule or a law, but sometimes he does it with a kick in the face but he does it all for a reason and something that I admire and His passion and love for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5473.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that that's a common denominator tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5476.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5478.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Caraviello touched on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5482.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He is probably the smartest person I've ever been around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5486.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would call him so giddy about something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5488.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I found something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5489.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd say, Adam, how about this rule?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5492.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or how about this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5493.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he'd say, no, that's good, George.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5495.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But how about this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5496.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm like, I was wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5499.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But he wouldn't tell you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5502.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or it would be like, I have to do this, Adam, could you, I sent over a speech.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5507.792s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And 15 minutes later, I'd get something back and say, wow, that's great, but that's nothing of what I sent you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5514.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, it's, when I first started running for school committee, one of the first phone calls I made was to a young man named Adam Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5524.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he was amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5527.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he helped,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5528.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: mold that team that started my journey as an elected official more than 16 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5536.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I admire your passion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5540.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I admire your, what people don't realize is your strong integrity and for what's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5548.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's something that we laugh about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5550.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not going to lie to you, Adam.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5552.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The last couple of months, we've had a few jokes behind your back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5555.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I tell you, people don't realize, when he first got angry because somebody moved all of his paperwork, people don't realize that's years, years of organizing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5570.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if Adam needed anything, if I said something, and I'm like, geez, I don't know where to look for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5573.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd look at Adam, and he would know exactly out of a mound of pile of paperwork that he knew exactly where to go to help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5580.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he probably still has it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5584.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5585.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that knowing the Knight family, and I was fortunate to know his dad and know his beautiful wife and his kids,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5595.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, I think this is good for Adam.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5597.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that the last year that he had has been very difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5601.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's been true to what you're supposed to be and what we should all admire too as a family man that supported his brother through probably his most difficult time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5611.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, um, you know, I wish people would know what you've gone through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5618.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, but as a friend, like I said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5622.236s">[Scarpelli]</a>: my first phone call, then my second phone call to get whether your approval or your understanding or you correcting me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5631.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate that, my friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5632.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And like I said, there's a common denominator tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5637.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sad because I'm not going to see you on a regular basis, that we're going to be mandated to see each other at least every other Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5644.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I'm proud that we're friends and I'm proud that my kids<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5651.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: get to be around Adam Knight because he's a great role model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5655.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know my daughter Gianna loves him and his family and I know John is at Merrimack and he's following Adam's footsteps out of Merrimack and I know how much Dina loves both you and Rick and what you guys have done for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5674.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm gonna miss you my friend and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5677.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I thank this opportunity because I have a good friend that I feel I can count on for the rest of my life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5685.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5738.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, all right, kid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5757.756s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Buy the coffee, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7258.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I, uh, Councilor Morelle, I just, Council President, um, I'm honored to call you president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7266.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think I've reached out to you some tough meetings and I wanted to, you know, publicly say that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7274.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you've handled yourself with grace and honor, and I think you've been a true leader to this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7279.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like Councilor Caraviello said, it's not easy when your community is viewed as divided, you know, the new metric, the old metric.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7289.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I would get phone calls, imagine this Morell, I said, imagine this Morell, imagine Nicole Morell would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7299.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: take an opportunity to stand up and run for an office that's not traditionally for an independent, strong woman, and come in and do what you've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7310.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I thank you because you give my daughter the understanding that you can reach for anything you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7319.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we haven't seen eye to eye to everything, but it was always out of respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7324.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what people don't understand is that it's for a reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7330.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And Nicole Morell doesn't go home at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7332.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They tell people, yeah, but Nicole definitely goes home at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7335.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How can I destroy that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7338.514s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It became comical at times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7340.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think you've stood up and you have taken the leadership with honor, with grace, with distinction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7350.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm proud that I've served with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7354.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that the most honorable thing in life, I think I've, in my life that I've ever seen, is watch my wife raise our two amazing kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7364.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And tonight, it like kicked me like a mule watching you with your baby and understand the huge sacrifices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7373.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I remember the nights that you'd have to run out of here for 20 minutes and run back and people didn't know why, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7380.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: your mom first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7382.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you taking this hiatus, I know that when everything moves forward like we expect and have a positive growth with your beautiful son, that you'll be back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7399.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that we appreciate the four years that you've given us, and I appreciate you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7407.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: being our leader and I think that I hope that we do see you around still and I'm sure that if you see me go the wrong way that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7418.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One thing people don't realize, I don't think, is how tough you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7421.183s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And George Scott Pell likes to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7425.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People think I yell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7426.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm yelling at people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7427.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't yell at people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7428.548s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is how I speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7430.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Ask my wife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7430.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just talk loud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7433.671s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's great because you give it right back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7436.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there was some things me and you would talk about right here, and you'd say, oh yeah?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7440.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you forget two years ago?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7441.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm like, oh wow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7443.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm like, ooh, ooh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7445.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it's out of respect, and I appreciate that, because I think that's what this council is so great about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7452.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done some great things, and we've respected each other enough to agree to disagree, but not cross the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7461.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so I thank you, and I wish you much luck and happiness at home, and enjoying your beautiful son.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7472.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and I'm sure we'll see you around, so I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7474.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GbhjYJ_J4oE&t=59.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would make the motion that we bring the city council pay down so we don't have restrictions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=529.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=530.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I talked to the petitioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=532.477s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that what we'll do to speed things along is we'll call for a subcommittee on a state-specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=540.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're looking at January 19th at 6 o'clock prior to our 7 o'clock meeting, and we'll ask for legal representation to be present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=551.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the building department that could assist us in making sure we make the right decisions for both the neighborhood and the business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=560.64s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I motion to move this to subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=755.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Motion approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=756.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=771.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=772.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2254.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2255.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council Vice President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2258.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm gonna speak as someone who no one else in this council had the opportunity to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2266.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's someone that both sat on the school committee seat and in the city council seat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2271.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And understanding, I'll give you my opinion, then I'm gonna share a lot of emails, phone calls, conversations I've had in the last few days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2281.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think they're very telling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2284.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you decide to take the chance and the responsibility of becoming an elected official, it's being elected official.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2294.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's truly a position of service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2298.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're doing it for a reason other than the paycheck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2303.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've never looked at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2308.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, as I grew up in this city,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2315.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I took it upon myself to watch people that led the way for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2319.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they gave back in service, whether it's coaching little league teams, whether it's volunteering at the food bank, whether it's joining a school committee that didn't make any money, or whether it's taking the leap to the city council, because you think you could make more of a difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2339.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I generally, personally feel that understanding the process of a pay structure being a major issue, I think it's sad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2351.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's sad to look at it that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2353.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To think that I had one phone call that said that understanding that we can get better candidates if we pay, that's sad even to think of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2364.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Imagine, imagine voting in people that are there for the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2371.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's horrifically frightening to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2374.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we move forward, what I found very, very glaring in this situation, the issue of gender equity in pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2383.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we received a dialogue from three female school kid members that knew nothing about this, that didn't want anything to do with this vote and think that they're totally against it on the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2401.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were two members that didn't reach out to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2404.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: two members that didn't reach out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2407.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there were two members that I find it, it's very frightening that these two members are the catalyst behind this motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2422.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So let me share a few things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2426.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a member of the council, we had an opportunity to stand up at budget time, didn't we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2432.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Didn't we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2433.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2433.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And three of us stood up and said no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2437.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But some others didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2443.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll revert to most important thing that bothers me more than anything are the phone calls that I got from the people that work the hardest in our school district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2452.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: By the way, majority of them are women.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2457.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they're getting their butts kicked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2459.532s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what's glaring to this, it's something that we need to turn to our school committee members that's more important than a pay structure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2467.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: From what I've heard, and I'm sure we'll hear it tonight, that the possible legalities of lack of coverage in special needs classrooms, lack of coverage with teachers absences, lack of coverage in severely disabled classrooms, that's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2489.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm glad this came up in the sense that this brings something forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2495.821s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the city council does more, and I think its responsibilities are far more succeeding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2504.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Doesn't mean I'm better than a school kid member at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2508.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But our responsibilities, our charter, give us the responsibility far greater than our colleagues on the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2519.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to be honest with you, I'll make a motion later on, whether it's tonight or another night, that since we've cut our time, I'll make the motion if equity, financial equity is serious to the issue, then I would make the motion that we bring the city council pay down so we don't have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2548.169s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because Mr. President, Mr. President, again, this city councilor didn't join or didn't ask their constituents to hire, to vote for me so I can make a paycheck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2561.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not rich, we're not gonna get rich.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2563.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when everybody ran for their office, when our school committee ran for their office, you're gonna have some candidates that are gonna be stepping in seats that are in the audience tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2572.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sure if you ask them, if this was a big concern in their eyes,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2578.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they would absolutely flat say, no way, that was not the intention at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2582.69s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just think that this seems like there's fingerprints with only two spooky members that are pushing an agenda, and I think that this is a sad, sad day when we have unions that don't have contracts, when we have teachers that don't have coverage, and more importantly, please, more importantly, that I find frightening as a former teacher,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2606.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that I've talked to a few paraprofessionals, I have two teachers that told me straight out that we have classes, high level, low leveling functioning classes, with special need classrooms, with lack of aids, with lack of certified teachers, and they're just covering them just to have a body in the room, and that's against the law, and that our kids, they don't deserve that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2627.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's the biggest issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2635.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know this is going to be left on the next council in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2641.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think it's important that this happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2645.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These phone calls, these conversations, I think it's great, because I think that's the dialogue we need to move the needle where we need to move it to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2653.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm not going to be critical, but I will to all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2657.929s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Get involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2659.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Don't come out just when it involves your issue, because that's what we're seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2663.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we can't do that anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2666.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4050.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you clap, it stops it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4052.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Silence is the whole thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4055.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not a Zach against George thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5049.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. D'Antonio.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5051.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5051.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5053.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just one second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5054.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Sharpell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5054.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just a point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5056.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a comment that's out that there's $25 million we can spend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5062.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5063.745s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5064.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There isn't $25 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5066.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not trying to debate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5067.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was something that was in our free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5071.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not like it's still there and that we have to use it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5073.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5074.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5074.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just a point of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8547.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8547.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8548.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, then Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8550.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council Vice President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8552.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, this isn't easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8554.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that this is what we agree to disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8558.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think this is what this council is about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8561.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: not similar to what we're hearing that happens on the school side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8565.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate that, that we have this here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8567.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but again, my intention was to listen to everybody, understanding, weighing the pros and the cons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8575.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as much as I respect former council, my motion was going to be received in place on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8582.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that would be my motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8584.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to receive and place on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8586.071s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, because I feel strongly enough that I've heard enough that we need to move forward without this as an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8591.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Remember, we're going into this with a new council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8595.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why would we have them give them that responsibility?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8600.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what I feel that it's just not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8603.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=10498.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=10498.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor GRIFFITHS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=10499.142s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor GRIFFITHS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=10499.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, if you can, I think that—we really can't debate it, but what we can do<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=10504.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, when you come, developers are smart, so they're not stupid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=10507.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're trying to circumvent the system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=10511.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what we can do, if we can, if we can share your information with the clerk to get the information to the code enforcement officer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=10523.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because what you're saying, what they're doing, we have everything in place for that because we do have some developers out there that take total advantage of this in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=10541.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, we can be pretty hard on some developers and I think that and making sure that they told the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=10546.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can make sure that our code enforcement officer has that, that address, and they get out there tomorrow, I'll make a phone call tomorrow as well to the code enforcement office to make sure they come out and set up a regular, you know, visit where they check in periodically throughout the day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=10559.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, because if it's that bad,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12338.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, so we change the title<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12340.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to the Council of King Kong's resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12344.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Solid waste resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12515.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I disagree with everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12516.953s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want to honestly, I think you've done a great job with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12523.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As I'm following through, it's very thorough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12525.575s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I feel secure that you've done your due diligence and feathering your cap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12531.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a big, big contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12534.096s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to see the work that you put into it, I have so much faith in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12538.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate your hard work, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12886.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12887.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a problem that's going on for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12890.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know we've heard from the state delegates that said that there are issues that are going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12895.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that Rick's worked on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12896.859s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12898.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what I'm hearing from all these sides is that there's different entities, there's the state, there's the electrical utility company, there's the private entity, there's the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12909.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to get everybody in a room and realize before somebody gets killed and then everybody's gonna be pointing their fingers at everybody else, we need to get everybody in a room for this meeting and find a resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12920.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because they say the simplest thing is meeting with the neighbors and taking up the pavers so they can make the changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12926.574s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, if the neighbor doesn't want that because they're afraid it's not going to be replaced the proper way, let's find a resolution to make this happen so we're not sitting here and talking about a horrific accident or a jogger or a bike rider that's going down South Border Road that gets killed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12944.584s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think it's important that through public safety we call for this emergency meeting to make sure all the parties are in a room because I think everybody's working their tail off, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12954.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're all doing their own thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12956.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one's sitting together and saying, let's do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12958.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's why I bring this forward tonight, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=13048.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if I can, I think that that's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=13050.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wouldn't want anybody to touch our pavers unless we have a commitment by the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=13057.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the public entities that are all involved to say, hey, listen, this is what we'll do to make sure at your discretion with your contractor, making sure that everything gets put back the right way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=13069.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's the only thing that's fair, because I think what's happening is, it's dogs chasing his tail until somebody gets seriously hurt, and then all of a sudden we're sitting there saying, all it was is just moving some pavers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=13080.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think having everybody in the room is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=13082.859s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that if Mr. Vita's, we should invite him too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=13086.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, we should get him involved as well, so he's familiar with that, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2140.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2141.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2148.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm listening and I appreciate that, you know, understanding this with clarity and making sure like we talked about, making sure that the information is out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2159.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think this meeting is perfect because it is the information that will help us guide us for our next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2164.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=340.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mike Noville from National Grid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=344.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Cam Hansel from National Grid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=378.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=379.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What time of day will this work be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=382.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You can determine that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=384.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: okay so we can do something at night because right now that area is a mess traffic wise so and the last piece I know maybe the city engineer the paving was that going to be curb to curb?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=416.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we'll be done curb to curb.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=485.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, but are we now in the practice, because it's great news if it is, but that now our public utilities that come in to open up our streets, it'll be curb to curb like we do with the private entities as well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=557.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=557.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, if I can, while the engine is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=562.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How long, again, will the process take for this project?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=569.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=569.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that two reasons for the question, that area is a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=575.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we all know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=577.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now that it's all right turns there, I mean, that area's just flooded in the morning now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=582.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This could be something done at night with the city's request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=586.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is there a better time to do it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=591.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Police, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=599.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For safety reasons, we would defer to the traffic sergeants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=602.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's something that if we can, as part of the record, we'll reach out as part of a motion to reach out to the chief of police to request their thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=618.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if it's not that we have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=621.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a detailed informational plan that goes out to our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=625.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And just because that, I take that, I think everybody knows that trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=630.494s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've heard phone calls and emails from multiple residents about that right turn only being a major change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=637.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then if you drive through Medford Square, now you see why, but I think that making sure that everybody's informed of what happens if it does happen during the day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=645.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But thank you, ma'am.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1468.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1469.494s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Bears and Councilor Caraviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1472.456s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that my frustration is what's felt throughout the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1475.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You said something very important because what bothered me more than anything in this time in our country, you want people to get involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1484.423s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I had five to six people call me and say, you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1488.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll never, ever vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1492.907s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in an election for the city ever again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1496.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll leave my vote just the national agenda and that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1498.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because that's how disgusted they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1501.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I can see why, being part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1503.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is, and I'll give you an example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1508.079s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Caraviello did, in running his election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1512.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was honest, he was fair, he worked hard, and he asked volunteers to come out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1517.859s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And those volunteers came out to assist, like any candidate could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1523.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any candidate could have done what Councilor Caraviello did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1526.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, it didn't come out in his favor, and that's life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1531.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But to hear the horrific issues that poll workers were put in, and the poll watchers, so people don't know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1544.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you're allowed to have poll watchers, and it's a machine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1548.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the poll watchers go out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1549.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a calculated strategy where they're allowed to have poll watchers sit in a relatively close area that you can hear and see the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1563.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The process is very simple, that the poll watchers<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1567.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was talk that they were told they can't sit down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1572.65s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then they were told they can't sit down if they bring their own seats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1576.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if that's the case, OK, bring your own seat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1578.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Pole watchers sat in their seats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1582.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then they were told to move 25 feet away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1586.293s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then the process was very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1588.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The process that by law states, in the general laws that we had attorneys pass out to each polling station, each warden, and it said straight out, the process is such, when the person approaches to vote, if they have a license or not,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1609.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because we had the new scanning system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1611.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And believe me, I do not blame the poll, the workers that are at the poll, I don't blame them, because a lot of them are great people and they just weren't prepared, but they had the licenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1623.671s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They have the license, you're supposed to sweep their name and address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1628.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're supposed to say, George Scarpelli, 27 Butler Street, and the poll worker responds back, George Scarpelli, correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1637.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for the purpose of clarity and transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1642.105s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then what they do is that person has a book, same as the workers do, and they check off who comes in and votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1650.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then if you have a machine that works for you, volunteers that want to work for you, you then have people pick up those books every two to four hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1658.16s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then you have people in offices or at homes calling people and saying, hey, we see you haven't voted today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1665.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you need a ride?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1666.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a machine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1667.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's done all over the country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1669.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we saw this past Tuesday, I'm not even gonna bring up a formal, maybe I will, because I said what happened before, I said, please, this is why this country is such a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1682.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Conspiracy theories through the roof, and I'm not a conspiracy theorist, I hate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1687.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what happened this past week and the weeks before this and understanding how this process went was a disgrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1698.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How much money did we lose?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1700.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you don't open up the boxes of the ballots to a few days before you have to mail out the mailing ballots, and you realize you have someone's name spelt wrong, so they have to be thrown away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1714.745s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now you have to get ballots reprinted and rushed in, which is thousands of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1720.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then they go out and then we realize that we're getting phone calls from Ward 6 saying everybody that ordered, that requested four ballots got eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1728.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody that got asked for two got four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1731.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody asked for three got six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1733.613s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we had to reassure the public that even though it looks bad, they cannot vote three to six times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1741.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we said that day,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1743.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that meeting before the election, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1746.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it's because you're understaffed, ask for help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1748.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we have to approve anything from this council to assist, bring in a thousand people from the state, whoever you need to assist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1756.779s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, Councilor Caballero's team was very proactive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1761.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know for sure, because my wife was one of the poll watchers, that at her location, she showed up at seven where polls open, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1768.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, at 7.30, they still weren't ready to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1772.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then we heard some places that we had machines that weren't working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1777.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: By law, when you test a machine, the notice has to go out to the public and it has to be done in an open process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1787.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Before the election, that process has to be open to the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1791.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They come in and you can watch the Elections Commission test the machines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1798.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That didn't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1799.945s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That didn't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1801.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then as you went through the whole process, we will tell you that we were given a notice from the election director that said, the votes that were taken, the votes that were taken from early voting and absentee voting will be put through the voting machine here at City Hall at 8.30 in the morning and then posted at eight o'clock here at City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1829.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a memo<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1831.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that's public that went out to the election officials, elected officials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1836.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then you realize, now you go through the numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1840.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You sit there and you go through the numbers, you have people getting their numbers, and it's a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1847.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was talks that people coming back saying that the police were being yelled at by wardens, that ballots were being counted, they didn't understand where the ballots were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1855.805s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had people here counting ballots without being in public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1863.071s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now that's, that's, it's, it's not to, it's, it's, it's, is it, does it affect the election?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1871.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I don't think it affects the election, but the perception of it is terrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1878.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if this happens in any other, any other department, things have to be taken swiftly and quickly and making sure this doesn't happen again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1889.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1891.417s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm gonna ask for, if we can, as a resolution, I would amend the existing paper to ask for our election commissioner, our election director, our commission,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1909.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to come before this council to explain in detail what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1915.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one of the biggest questions I have from a lot of people that were waiting that night at 835, we had probably between, I believe it was 10,500 votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1925.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they said, that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1930.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we said, wait a second, Medford has never, never been that low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1935.351s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What happened to the ballots that were counted in the morning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1937.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know what you're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1941.035s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So then all of a sudden at one o'clock in the morning, they posted something that said they found the ballots and it was 4,000 more ballots and this is what it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1950.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Regardless who won, who lost,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1952.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That just doesn't look good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1955.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Perception is reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1957.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is what, this is the type of situation that brings the fire to the ignorance of our country sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1966.11s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what's sad about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1967.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the reason for this, the reason why I want to move forward and, and get a detailed report, and then ask for, you know, the Secretary of State's office to get involved to them do an audit, because we need answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1981.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So people can understand that your elected officials are holding people accountable when they're not doing their job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1988.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can squash<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1989.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and move forward for our next elections without any other issues or concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1994.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because like Councilor Behr said, perception is reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1997.671s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said it the night, the week before the election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2000.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Perception is reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2001.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what happened is exactly what we would hope, we were scared would happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2007.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now you have a room full of people that are just as upset because the process was terrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2014.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was terrible and somebody has to be held accountable, period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2018.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because in my position, if I left a little kid in the park by himself unattended, guess what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2025.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The next morning, I wouldn't be working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2029.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So in the elections department, when you make these many mistakes, something has to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2036.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So Madam President, that's my resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2039.456s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate it and thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2718.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we are at the point where everybody really expressed the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2723.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think the governing body in the state needs to get involved, and I think that this council should send a letter to the Secretary of State's office, to Galvin's office, so I'd make that a formal motion that we craft a letter, send it to the Secretary of State's office, and ask them to look into this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2744.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2747.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And just if I can, Madam President, I don't want people to understand that when we heard all these issues, the poll workers that are there are maybe mostly the sweetest people in the world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2762.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're doing something that's thankless, truly is thankless.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2766.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But one thing that was resounding throughout that day is how they weren't trained properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2773.373s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They didn't know what was right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2776.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the sweetest woman that I love dearly, when I went to vote, she looked at me and she said, the first three letters of your name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2783.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, no, that's not how it goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2787.717s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But these are the issues that went on everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2790.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had one poll watcher that was put 25 feet away in the corner, was presented the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2797.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She was then moved by the warden behind eight feet away in compliance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2802.202s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then our elections commissioner came in and said, get out, go back to where you were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2808.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not the rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2811.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it was the arrogance as well, because you have people that volunteered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2816.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and as part of this process, which this is what we want in our country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2820.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We want fair and open involved processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2823.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and again, I think that letter that we draft helps with the healing and the understand that we can move on and understand that we have something in place, Madam President, for especially November, that we feel safe and confident in our processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2839.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5068.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I think the biggest concern that I have is, as we're talking, as we're seeing some of the new changes we're seeing and some of the development that we're seeing, one constant comes back to me from neighbors and residents that they shared what I felt was an issue was that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5089.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we're moving forward with these zoning changes, we see that they're important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5092.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We see that they can be successful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5094.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we don't have, though, is proper notification when we do certain jobs in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5102.379s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think we do a very good job informing our constituents of projects that are coming about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5108.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll use Mystic Ave as an example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5112.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That evening, we talked about a building that sounds great, but I posed it for the fact that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5120.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it right now, it's a unicorn, and I didn't get any answer from the administration of what the vision is for that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5128.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No different than what's happening over at the old KISS 108 site at the T building in Wellington, that the building's being razed and we still have no vision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5138.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, that's very close to having two gateways of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5144.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that moving forward with any more zoning is, to me,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5150.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is a slippery slope to the fact that we're not letting our constituents know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5154.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are some projects that organizations, I'll give you an example with our housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5162.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There have been multiple meetings, multiple neighbors, opportunities for people to speak on different projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5173.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think we see that too often.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5176.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when it comes to some of these positions and some of these projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5181.64s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I tell you, I think when we talked about putting together the zoning study and having that bring that team in that will go neighborhood to neighborhood, remember we talked about that and getting the idea of the residents of what people want Medford to look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5198.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It seems like we forgot that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5199.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not doing that anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5201.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's been put in the back burner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5203.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, we haven't done anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5206.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're coming up with new zoning changes and we're saying, well, we could do this now because this might work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5214.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But in totality, we still don't have a plan and we still aren't including all of our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5220.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and I think that's a concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5222.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5247.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think for any projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5250.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, for anything that's going on in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5252.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been getting phone calls, I get 45 phone calls, it's something we're gonna talk about later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5345.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what I'll do is I'll ask, what I'll do is I'll ask a request because I think what's getting out, because if you ask, there's a demographic that if you look at all the surveys and there's a demographic that gets the information and it seems to be one demographic, there's a lot of people, if you ask the common person in this room that's not involved with this, they've never heard anything about this because the message is getting out to the people that it seems like that are pinpointed to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5374.714s">[Scarpelli]</a>: direct mailers or groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5380.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5383.796s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I say this project, I'm saying as a whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5387.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm having calls from as a whole when we're talking about different surveys and things being done around the community and your office getting back to people and saying, oh no, we sent it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5399.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there are times that I'm in those same neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5402.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't get anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5403.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm a city councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5404.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that I can't, I can't not listen or bring forth what my constituents are bringing to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5431.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So let's talk about what we talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5434.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something that we were very excited about is hiring that zoning team and then bringing our vision of our development, our growth in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5444.466s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Remember, going neighborhood to neighborhood, involving everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5450.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5451.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Having community meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5467.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This council requested it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5470.236s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5471.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This council has requested it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9826.917s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just a quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9827.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What do the residents in Wilmington say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9844.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So will the residents of Wilmington know about this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9854.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, it's the same situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9857.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's really the same situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9858.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're in front of us today to hold something through that has to be accepted tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9868.474s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When a zoning amendment comes to this council from anybody whatsoever, you have to- I know that, but the way you presented it, it seems like even after this process, it seems like it's going to go pretty quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9881.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It has to be done right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9914.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One public meeting on it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9915.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9916.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when did we find out about it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9917.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When did your office find out about it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9944.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, these are things that, some things that just out of your control, but in the totality of these processes, it just doesn't look good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9953.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's no different than the voting situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9955.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It just doesn't look good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9957.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I consistently get,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9960.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: constituents that reach out and say, we knew nothing about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9964.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't hear this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9966.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so I think, you know, as a council, we need to figure out a way whenever we put these projects out, that there's gotta be some assistance that if they don't have the funding or anything that has to be done, because the biggest issues we have to come back to us are the constituents that they knew nothing about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9986.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I, you know, I, we, we had, we were fortunate enough with the last speaker, the last project that the housing authority did a lot of the legwork.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9996.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: on their dime or the way they processed it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9998.364s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is something that I'm hearing over and over again, especially the last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10003.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate it, and I understand that the situation's a little different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10007.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's just not fair, because I know what's going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10010.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to get phone calls tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10012.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The people who watch this will all have to say, you don't care about us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10015.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The answer is easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10016.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At least we know now we can say this is state mandated, and this is a situation, and it's out of our hands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10021.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it just doesn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10025.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: just doesn't look good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10026.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10027.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11060.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11062.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is unbelievable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11065.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're so excited about it, it's our neighborhood, and the only thing, I told my 20-year-old, John, I'll take you to the park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11075.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I mean, everything about it is amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11077.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, I'm sure, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11079.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hunt, this is one of the reasons, I got about 15 phone calls from the Butters that it's a really big dog-friendly neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11088.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they're confused that they didn't know about the process fully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11094.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is what, and they wanted to come here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11099.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, well, this isn't about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11102.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11103.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't know if there's something we can do to talk with them, set up a separate meeting with these folks that so they can understand the process that you, it was, I believe that the question was, could you do separate areas and construction?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11116.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't see that happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11117.77s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So from what I've been told, so I don't, but I think if that, other than that, I don't think anybody in this country is looking at that, what we're doing up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11129.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11130.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it's really bringing people back up the hill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11132.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, it, you know, when you talk about, you know, it's, it's re re re energizing so many different groups, you know, you have the baseball people that are saying, wow, you have, you know, you have new ball fields, we have multi purpose, we have, you know, you know, special needs, you have adults saying that looking for that apparatus park, I mean, this is something that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11154.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, I'm excited to say we're far ahead of Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11158.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, because this is what I do in Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11160.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The people are begging for this in Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11162.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is in planning stage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11164.33s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm so excited that we're seeing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11166.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I, you know, and I understand the process we have to go through, the funding mechanism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11172.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's nice to see ARPA money being used this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11176.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's exactly what, you know, you want it to be used for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11180.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11183.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, you're gonna get a lot of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11188.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The next two years, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11943.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We lost zero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11946.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This past week we lost a member of our teaching community at Bedford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11952.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We lost John Lazzaro, a former colleague and friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11961.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: John's had a tough last couple of years, but no matter what he went through physically, he still found his way to his classroom and to support his chemistry students and his science students from high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11978.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Great demeanor, he always had a sense of responsibility<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11986.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, confidence that only John had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11989.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, you know, we went through a lot of beginnings when we first started together as teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11995.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know his wife, Kay, is one of the best people in the world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12000.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they raised two amazing children, John and Elizabeth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12006.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know my son, John, went to school with Elizabeth and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12009.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's definitely, you can feel the void in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12012.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He also had a brother, Phillip, and his brother, Mike, who's also a custodian at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12018.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that he'll be laid to rest tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12022.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope that we can get word to the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12025.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope that they'll be lowering the flag at half-mast in his honor, because he deserves that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12033.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, to John's family, we feel your loss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12038.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll never feel the pain that they do, but he'll be missed for sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12042.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12376.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I own a solar company now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12422.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why don't you say something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12697.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Madam President, I know that one thing that I need to mention again is the commitment of the football program to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12707.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that shines brighter than any win we've ever had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12712.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's what's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12714.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Their commitment to the community and volunteering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12717.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12719.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They don't have to win a game for what they do with the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12722.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I applaud you guys for doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12723.945s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that coach Curley has to take a lot of credit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12727.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I also have done this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12728.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People have to understand if you didn't live in Medford, if you didn't go to Medford High School, if you didn't play a sport.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12736.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you didn't have the luck of having Steve Miller as your equipment manager at Medford High or live in that era, you truly don't understand what it means to be a true Mustang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12752.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, you know, Bud Kelly, he coined the term blue and white flowing through your veins and legitimately,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12761.574s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I, my freshman year, I wanted to cut myself just to see if I was, is it true?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12765.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because that's how much it would convince you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12767.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12776.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Don't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12777.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you come to the game next Thursday, you can buy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12785.453s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe blue and white t-shirt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12788.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I do believe blue and white, but I will tell you my point to saying this is that it's very different because when you hear some people say it, you know, Mustang pride, you know, there's some clowns that do do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12798.761s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's just a word for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12801.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we appreciate you, Chris, because I think you keep that alive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12806.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And and I think that's what you're seeing the change with these kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12810.509s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not just John Curley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12812.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12812.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Chris Murphy's energy to say, hey, listen, being a Method Mustang is part of life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12818.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12820.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're Method Mustangs behind this reel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12821.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's like, you feel like part of the team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12823.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what I think our whole community is lacking right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12826.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're forgetting that we're all Mustangs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12829.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And maybe if people lived like that a little bit more and understood that to be true, I think that it would stop a lot of animosity in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12895.168s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're all together as Mustangs supporting our team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12902.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, Nicole, I'll even buy a baby a nice little outfit, a little Mustang outfit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12907.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Chris, if you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13102.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was nothing better than listening to a group of Brazilian kids screaming defense while the offense was on the field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13108.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was nothing better than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13110.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have other things we should celebrate, but we should be celebrating<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13114.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The fact that our marching band won the championship and came in this community, I love the fact that they had the police escorts come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13122.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are things we should be celebrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13124.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have so many great things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13125.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what elevates us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13127.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thanksgiving is a good start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13149.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have it right here for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=32.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=614.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=615.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=616.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's what my sentiments were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=618.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that the biggest concern we had when this came in front of this body is that, especially at the time during the pandemic, we were seeing the effects, the negative effects with what was happening in our country affecting our brick and mortar businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=636.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as we continue to work out of the pandemic, and here we are, we're finally safe, hopefully,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=645.01s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're seeing businesses thriving, especially in the square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=648.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the number one goal is not to allow<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=654.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the food trucks other than what we stipulated in the guidelines that Council Bears expressed that it was for special events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=664.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, but the concern was that there are special events that come up and sometimes the council won't meet and it leaves organizations in limbo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=674.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's giving the right to city administration<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=678.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and the Board of Health to give that permission and take it off the City Council plate for those purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=687.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't want anybody to miss out on an opportunity, but at the same time, my number one goal from the beginning was protecting our brick and mortar businesses, especially in the climate that we're in right now here in Medford, where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=703.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we have, we need to keep and what we need to grow on the brick and mortar businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=710.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we're bringing in food trucks from outside the city and allowing these organizations to roll up, we're going to really taint what we're looking for, and especially most of our squares and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=729.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and bringing more solid businesses to the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=734.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I agree with Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=736.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we agreed on a good plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=740.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for their purposes of making sure that no one is left behind, but at the same time, still protecting the brick and mortar businesses and not allowing the full-time or a specialized area that some communities do have that maybe their businesses thrive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=756.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Until I see our brick and mortar businesses thriving and people rushing to come to Medford and opening restaurants, I would hate to give a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=766.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a food truck provision to come and go as they may please and take business away from what we need to grow in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=774.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=942.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, I know other communities use, I can understand that too, but so leaving the permitting process with the health department to make sure that we follow those guidelines, but taking it away from the council to make sure that it's a more streamlined process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=960.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know other,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=962.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: communities use the communications department that does all the special events for the city, or even the parks and recreations director, and allowing that purview under the guidelines that we've given them, that's pretty simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=981.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that if the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=984.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Board of Health doesn't want to do that because it's out of their purview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=986.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=988.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we have other departments in the city that perform permitting processes that, given the guidelines of our ordinance, I think this shouldn't be a heavy lift.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=999.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have multiple departments here that we can delegate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1005.427s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the permanent process to if that's the only issue, I don't see why we can't just put that on the city administration to appoint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1015.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the best practice that they follow, because they run road races, they run special events, they do parades, they do walks around City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1024.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't perform those permits, someone that does that in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1028.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would recommend, Madam President, that this question be given to the administration to pinpoint the department and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1040.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: allow that department to follow through with the permitting process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1044.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1045.477s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1152.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let me finish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1155.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can this, we're making this very difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1158.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's one day special permits for special events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1161.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1163.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not special events four days in a row, unless<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1166.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the city that allows a permit if they had, let's say per se, a carnival in the city that lasted two or three days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1173.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're just protecting the long-term permitting process of a food truck anywhere in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1183.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've already decided we're against that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1185.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're protecting our brick and mortar businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1187.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know, this isn't a heavy lift.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1190.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To me, it's very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1192.088s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The permitting process goes to the administration to assign someone to do that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1196.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Health department assigns that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1198.93s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it's something that we didn't put in the ordinance that says that it has to be in a private, in a public way, then we can adjust that, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1208.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Other than that, I think it's that simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1211.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We do not want food trucks in a designated area anywhere, at least for now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1217.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: at least this council does, I'm speaking for myself, but until we have security and growth in our business community, allowing food trucks is only gonna hurt that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1231.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's my philosophy, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1992.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1995.805s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just as a resolution, I think, can we, I'll be asking this moving forward, that can we also have a report of the billable hours from KP Law to address situations like this to the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2012.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm going to be asking that moving forward until we have a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2021.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This this is a type of ordinance that is done within days in the in city halls all over this Commonwealth with the city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2031.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2033.764s">[Scarpelli]</a>: nothing personal, I just need to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2036.247s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Moving on, this is gonna be a common cry from Councilor Scarpelli till we see a city solicitor, that we get a report back of how many billable hours it'll take KP Law to address these concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2049.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2072.115s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, here's what I've got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2074.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, the council, the health director, the interim economic development director, any departments, the administration, if necessary, come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2556.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Vice President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2589.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=19.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=312.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=313.514s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm gonna speak more of a personal level,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=317.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've known Henry a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=318.695s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Henry and my dad were very close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=321.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I remember many a night in Boston Ave in West Medford with Henry, my dad, and Mr. Caggiano just hanging out and drinking homemade wine and telling stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=333.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you just realize, I often talk about when great residents pass on, who steps up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=341.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's refreshing when you could talk about a resident like Henry Miller and his lovely wife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=347.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what they've done for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=349.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's not someone that sits back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=351.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He sees an issue and he attacks it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=354.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he's always there to lend his word, whether you want to hear it or not, whether you like it or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=360.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate his friendship and we should all be honored to have residents like the Miller and family here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=369.096s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=390.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I found them in order and will approve, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=439.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, I think that we've already, I think coming from Representative Dash, I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=446.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: would sum it up for us and give us a brief synopsis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=449.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we've already gone through this, but I'd appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=516.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I make a recommendation that we table this until October.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=521.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: until date certain, which would be the date of November 28th or meeting that close to that day, whether it's the 1st of December, if that's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=540.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=540.636s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=549.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=869.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=871.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Bears, for bringing this forward because, you know, listen to everybody's points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=876.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It is a complicated situation, and I think that this brings me to my point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=880.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've talked to a couple of business owners that people aren't realizing some of the traffic calming measures that we've implemented<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=890.928s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll give you an example, one of our local businesses had five delivery drivers that were always on the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=899.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what they're finding right now is he had to let go of two delivery drivers, but the outside agencies, Grubhub, all the other automobile delivery services,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=912.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they've increased, he said, over 75%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=916.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what they're doing is they don't care where they're parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=919.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're still parking in the bike lanes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=921.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're still parking, you know, we've lost control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=924.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the reason why I bring that up is because I think it's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=927.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we move forward to make these decisions, and I appreciate Councilor Bears bringing this up, because I have neighbors calling me about that whole neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=934.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: where it is a cut through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=935.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was no different than what a couple years ago was Fulton Street, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=938.969s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was a Fulton Street area, the corridor, and people have just forgotten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=941.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now they're so fed up with it that they're just living with it by now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=945.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The issue I'm seeing is that it's good to do initial conversation with that traffic engineer, but I think we need to start involving the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=954.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I know that I got a few phone calls the other day with the whole idea of eliminating left-hand turns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=961.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, people calling me saying, well, where is that going to now lead the people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=965.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're going to lead them right into their right turns into their neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=969.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're, instead of going 50-50, their discussion is now you're flooding that area with 100% of the traffic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=977.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the truth of the matter is, there is no communication with the neighbors in those neighborhoods that are affected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=985.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate it, but I think we need to move forward with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=989.913s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I support Councilor Bears' initiative in getting our traffic engineer and working on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=995.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that corridor, but at the same time, I think that we should do this shockingly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1001.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I love the word transparent because it's never used in this community, but bringing the neighborhood into the meetings, bringing the neighborhood into the meetings with the traffic engineer and say, okay, what would one solution that you think, how would that solution affect<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1018.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: other situations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1020.264s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're not seeing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1021.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you know, just today to get emails and phone calls from from residents and business owners saying, you know, George, I know the sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1029.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't know what it checks a certain box.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1031.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the truth of the matter is, his business has increased automobile traffic that are parking, there's no enforcement use, we all see it, lift, whatever they are, whoever they are, they all they pull over wherever they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1048.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they pull into bike lanes, they block driveways, and they do whatever, they are now dictating what happens on our streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1056.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm gonna second Councilor Bears' initiative, but I would really like to see more community participation in these decisions so we can really get a true outlook, outline of what everybody sees, the people that live there every single day, and how one issue<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1076.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: one solution can affect another and just at least vet that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1080.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1787.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1883.756s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Vice President Bears?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1884.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1917.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1917.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just to share with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1919.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know I've received multiple phone calls, especially Ward 6, that we did get an email from the chief of staff, and I'll read that if that's okay, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1929.663s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1930.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Dear President Morell and city councilors, we recently learned that some addresses who are requesting early voting ballots have received more than one ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1941.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A short while ago, Steve Smerti and I met with elections to better understand what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1948.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, the uh...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1951.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, this process is not, it happened, there's still checks and balances that are in the system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1960.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry, my email is breaking up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1962.69s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In the system that would prevent someone from being able to physically cast multiple ballots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1967.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there are fail-safes to make sure that you cannot vote twice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1972.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Specifically, there is a unique identifier assigned to each voter and only allows them to cast a ballot once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1979.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we learn more about how this happened and steps that are going to be taken to avoid this from reoccurring, we will update the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1987.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that what I appreciate going forward with this resolution is the first thing is just to express that multiple phone calls that are very, very concerned with voter fraud, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2002.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the conspiracy theorists are going crazy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2005.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think my concern right now is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2009.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've seen some pretty drastic issues in the last month dealing with this election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2015.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One being that I believe the ballots, there were misspelled names and they had to redo ballots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2020.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe that's one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2022.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now with these ballots, it's not a few people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2026.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I guess I got a phone call from one person that said they requested two, they got eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2031.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is scary for the sense that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2037.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's gotta be some people held accountable for this situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2043.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this administration is fluffing this over like it's nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2049.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's costing the city a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2051.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's begin with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2052.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if they're giving away ballots, that's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2056.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If the misspelling ballots and then the ballots have to redone in a rush order to make sure that we can have a true election, this is a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2066.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So perception is reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2070.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just, I brought this up just to explain it, understand that I've talked to a very knowledgeable former elections coordinator that told me that George is no way that, you know, what people are saying on the streets, that that person is gonna take eight votes and they're gonna go to the ballot box, they're gonna mail eight votes for so-and-so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2092.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And rest assured, that's not the way it can happen that way because of the fail safes that are on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2098.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2099.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want to make sure everybody knows that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2101.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same time, I think we have to realize something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2106.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're two weeks away from a very big election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2110.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we've had two major flops with this election process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2116.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It doesn't look well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2118.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It doesn't look like it's being handled by a leader in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2125.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, we're moving forward for two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2127.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just pray that we're kept in the loop with everything that's happening because again, unfortunately, I was gonna bring this forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2135.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm glad we got the email beforehand because I believe it was only one district, one precinct that really-<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2145.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2146.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2146.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2146.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2147.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but again, I think moving forward, we need to, we need to buckle down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2152.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, this is, this is, you know, you see what's going on in this country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2156.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Every, the issue in this country is in what's inflammatory is voter fraud and everybody's going crazy about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2164.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not doing ourselves any favors in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2168.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just had to, I had to share my frustration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2172.079s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had to calm some people's nerves and understand publicly that there are fail safes in place, even though they're getting 10 ballots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2179.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm sure I'm gonna get text message and emails later saying, oh, no way, they'll find a way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2184.963s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But there isn't a way that they can use all eight ballots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2190.945s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but again, moving forward, I think we really have to tighten this department up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2196.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it starts with the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2198.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that it sounds political, but truly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2203.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's the CEO of this community, and this is happening under her watch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2208.453s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something has to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2210.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate it, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2534.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2535.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Bears brings up a great point, not to be insensitive, but we're two weeks away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2540.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who else is supporting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2544.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we have an elections coordinator who's not here two weeks before the election with these issues, who's that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2553.311s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That is true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2553.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's frightening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2554.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who's supporting that department right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2557.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do we have any information with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2567.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2569.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I didn't want but I appreciate because I think it is so sensitive right now, that it is heightened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2576.223s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the fact that who's supporting, you know, I don't, you know, we were very fortunate under clerk, he, you know, we had a great team together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2587.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and Councilor Bears is right, that's something we talked about at budget time, of the reduction of staff, and situations happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2598.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Every employee, they have the right, if they're injured, or sick, or hurt, that they need to take care of what they need to care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2604.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't wanna be insensitive to that at all, but the truth of the matter is, we're still two weeks away from a very important election, in my eyes, because I'm running.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2615.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, you know, I think it's important that I'd like to, if we can, I'd like to make a motion to see, can we ask the administration, are they supporting the staff, even if our director is on remotely, having people in the office is so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2640.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, is this somebody that are they working with maybe getting someone in for the next two weeks and three weeks to try to make sure that we're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2647.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're, we're filling the gaps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2657.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you tell me what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2662.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to say she hasn't been in or I think it was just like, she couldn't attend tonight because I'm just, and I'm just saying, if this is something that's longterm, we really need to find a way that we have assisted, we get assistance to that office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2755.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3742.548s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, and in a municipality, anytime there is any any pay that was that was distinguished during a certain time when a retiree was on duty, they would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3757.051s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's automatic, this is confusing me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3759.353s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe it's clerical error, but you can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3763.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not fair labor, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3767.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, it's definitely a fair labor act issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3768.621s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, you're talking about, again, our working men and women in our community, they're telling you that the money that everybody's getting, while you were there too, by the way,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3781.169s">[Scarpelli]</a>: through the through the worst time of our hyperinflation, you were there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3787.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3789.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know if the President can reach out to the city administration to get an answer by as soon as they can to get us an email that the chief of staff can inform us why this is happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3801.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you know if there's anybody else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3803.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that how you're the only person?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3813.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe anything that's negotiated... Right, I was active in negotiations, and I worked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3818.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Anything that's negotiated during the time that any retiree was still in place, they would be... I didn't retire, I actually resigned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3826.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Excuse me, or resigned, doesn't matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3827.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As long as you're working during that time, you are giving the same amount, same treatment, same incentives that they received.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3842.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Shockingly, we have another issue with our labor question with our working men and women here at City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3849.764s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Shockingly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3851.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can, I think we need to get word on this and get get it back to us as soon as possible because if, if we haven't, if we have one that's one too many, it was city employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3873.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, well, we can see that, but, you know, rumor has it there's a great team somewhere in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3878.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't seen it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3879.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, I think that, I don't know who to ask because I don't know what department's in and out, but- I'll reach out to the chief of staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3884.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can go HR, chief of staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3898.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, and then ask if there's any other employees, because I bet you there's other employees that just washed their hands of Medford and said, what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3904.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Typical Medford, they walk away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3906.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if they earned it, they deserve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3913.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not worth it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3914.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not fair to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3915.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You deserve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3916.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3916.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's get some answers, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3918.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then if we can, I'll put it on as a resolution for our next meeting to make sure that we follow up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3922.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3922.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good luck, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=11797.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=12844.099s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=946.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=946.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=1566.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=3101.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Check, check, okay, good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=250.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=252.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a first-generation U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=256.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: resident and Method resident, I was born to Italian-born parents who grew up in northern Italy in two little towns in Calabria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=271.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they came to this country, the greatest country in the world, to make something of themselves and for their families and start<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=280.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the legacy that they would be proud of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=282.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They came to this community and they loved Medford and appreciate Councilor Knight, excuse me, Councilor Caraviello for speaking earlier, but you have to understand there's still so many Italian Americans in Medford that were raised like me and have parents like mine and the sacrifices they made and to be just part of that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=307.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that history and that pride of being an American citizen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=313.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's funny, my dad, while my mother raised, well, she parented four children on her own, while my dad worked as a member of Revere Sugar, he worked at a meat packing company and at glass cutting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=330.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: company while going to Don Bosco High School to learn English because, as he said it, it was his honor to learn the language of the great country he moved to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=344.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that stands for a lot of Italian-Americans, proud Italian-Americans that live in Medford today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=349.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And just to acknowledge that fact that this is a good time to mention what they've done to make Medford what it is today, whether it's the arts, whether it's education, whether it's, you know, in the, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=367.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the political field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=369.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have Italian Americans, greatness all over this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=374.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate is bringing this forward and acknowledging this this time for the Italian Americans of metric.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=381.575s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=626.364s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=626.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council cover will bring this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=628.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that again a great method family when you talk about, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=634.613s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our friends at Alexander's again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=637.035s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Another another small business that is quick to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=644.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this death does hit South Medford hard, and the family of Alexander's just doesn't, it spreads throughout our community, so condolences to the family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=656.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=726.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hi, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=726.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Ribeiro, how are you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=730.953s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, this is a transfer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=734.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's going over to, you're taking over?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=737.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: From the Catracalla family?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=739.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is good news because there was a big question in that community, that neighborhood that we hope it was staying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=747.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is great news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=748.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you could just tell us a little bit about your concept and what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=772.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's great news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=773.258s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I see everything is in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=775.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, I know that, are you familiar with the hours of operations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=780.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And any, you realize that hours of operations that was granted to Bocelli's has to stop with them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=786.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=787.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then any extended hours, you have to come back for a special permit?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=790.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=790.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so I know my fellow colleagues have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=794.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see everything in order to move forward, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=832.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hi, how are you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=834.91s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So a new business and on High Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=837.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is very exciting, especially when you see said to me, what is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=843.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Maniscalco?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=845.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Rudy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=845.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=845.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So why don't you give us a description of what we're going to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=874.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, I can only imagine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=876.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this looks, I mean, everything is in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=879.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Your hours of operations, if you could just share with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=892.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=892.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, Madam President, I also see everything in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=896.107s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=897.888s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My colleagues have any questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2204.52s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President, and thanks for presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2207.621s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For one, Councilor, I've had a serious issue with how the community, how this community, our leadership team, really puts together the vision of our growth and development plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2222.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We say we have a comprehensive plan, but it is all over the place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2228.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To me, there are so many questions with this building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2232.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A, you're on probably one of the most busiest intersections, one of the biggest concerns of traffic in this community, huge issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2242.088s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How many people do you plan on occupying this building on a day-to-day basis?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2265.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Possibly 80, 100 people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2267.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there's only 23 parking spots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2270.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It abuts a neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2334.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2337.417s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As you can see, there's no guarantee for any business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2340.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if you last five to 10 years, the next business comes in and has no philosophy or belief in the same as you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2347.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, it affects our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2352.423s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please don't take this personal, because I would love to find a location for this type of development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2357.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2359.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we've turned a few away that has really hurt us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2362.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think the biggest issue I see<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2366.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is we don't have a true development plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2370.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You saw how it looks there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2372.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It looks out of place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2375.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a beautiful building, but it's out of place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2378.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have a community of two to three family homes no more than 100 yards away from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2384.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're talking about an intersection that has been habitually taken advantage of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2389.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're talking about a neighborhood that has felt that they have been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2394.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they have been treated so unfairly and overlooked so many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2398.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's a lot of variables that has nothing to do with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2401.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I want you to understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2402.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that when we talk about development and you look at the plan of Mystic Ave, man, I would love to see, I mean, the idea can be sold so easily when you're building<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2415.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: four, five, six, 10 similar locations, all the way down Mystic Ave, where there's establishments to eat, go for a drink, go for shopping, to live.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2426.107s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a community, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2428.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a community building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2429.888s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then when you're trying to sell the concept of 100 people in only 23 spots and thinking that now it's not gonna affect it, everybody's gonna drive a bike or a bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2438.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We wish that could be the case, but that's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2441.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At least that's what the neighbors, the neighbors that we deal with every day in that community, you have to understand, they're scorned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2447.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're part of this community that have been bypassed in many different levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2453.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As I'm sitting here right now, I'm getting text messages of people that live right on that road that are disgusted that we're even talking about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2461.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's a shame that, and I'll say it publicly, I think this is the concept, this is beautiful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2466.969s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That building is beautiful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2469.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, I think the idea of it, you know, when you see neighboring communities, like I'm sure you have, you see the assembly road, you see what's going on in Malden, you see what's happening in Everett, you're seeing this type of development grow together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2483.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we have a unicorn sticking out of an eight-story unicorn sticking out of probably the most densely populated traffic area that we've had so many issues in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2495.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I personally, not anything you did, but what this administration has done when we talk about development and growth, not having a true picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2507.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If the city sat next to you, stood next to you,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2511.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the development department sat with you, and they said, George, this is our plan, and this is what it's gonna look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2517.814s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I sat with a gentleman years ago in a disgusting field in Somerville, and he opened this door, and he showed me this full life-size model of something called Assembly Row.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2528.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And his vision was talking about gateway communities, talking about how when you enter Somerville, this is what it's gonna look like, this is what's gonna grow to this, this is what's gonna grow to that, and guess what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2539.171s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2540.636s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just this great little shop area now has buildings for health care, buildings for corporate development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2549.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's grown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2549.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People, a tea stop right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2552.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So of course you don't need parking there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2554.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you see how crazy it is there now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2556.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is what we're not having in Metro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2558.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just personally think that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2562.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you're a catalyst to say, okay, here is the perfect development team that wants to come back and talk about Lincoln, talking about taking care of the community, talking about parking issues, talking about environmental issues, looking at the sciences, and let's use them as a catalyst to say, okay, this is gonna be here, and this is how we're gonna grow that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2581.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If that was presented today, I would say to the neighbors that, hey, you can't question growth, but all they're seeing, like it was just said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2590.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's just standing out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2592.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It just doesn't belong there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2594.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there are too many questions right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2596.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why I wouldn't be able to support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2598.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's not, believe me, it's not personal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2599.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that your concept, if it rolled down the street with five other buildings, with the concept of this is what we want from Mystic Ave, we're just not seeing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2610.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not seeing that from the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2611.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And for this Councilor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2613.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For the neighbors that have reached out to me that are nervous about these issues of parking, sense of community, sense of traffic, sense of lifestyle change, they think this one building without understanding the concept after this building and what that means to their neighborhood is what's giving them the fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2631.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that has opened my eyes to say, I can't support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2634.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I hope you can understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2636.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I just hope the city opens their eyes and says, how do we help our developers get the support of their council by presenting a plan for the city that's gonna show this area, by the way, probably the last of the Mohicans, the last area close to Boston that we can build on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2655.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know how important that corridor is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2658.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That corridor is huge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2659.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The last corridor leads into Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2661.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we know how important that land is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2664.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But without a plan from the city and from what I'm hearing with neighbors and their issues with what we talked about, and even before you were here, God, it took us years to put in a crosswalk right at that set of lights because of the dangerous area that it is and the heavy trafficked area that it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2686.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I hope you can understand that's how I feel and I appreciate you being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2690.142s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Could I make a couple comments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2691.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4345.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just moving forward, I heard some things that my fellow council said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4351.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They sound great if there was a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4355.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One of my fellow councils sounded a little desperate today, and I truly don't think we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4358.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is an opportunity for us as a community to really set the groundwork for what one of my colleagues said, to really rejuvenate a corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4369.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And from another one of my colleagues said, really set that gateway, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4374.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've obviously developed this, you've seen it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4377.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so I'm sure that, I'm not asking for your comment, but I'm sure that you can see my point of view when we're looking at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4384.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: smart growth and development, and what we're seeing is spot growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4390.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a comprehensive plan that really is not involved comprehensively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4396.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that our director is on the call tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4400.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is there a diagram, is there a vision of the Mystic Ave Corridor that Office of Community Development<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4410.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4411.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I would like to see the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4411.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh peers across the Commonwealth set the groundwork the table to show Councilors in their cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4418.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What that would look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4420.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I would tell you if this was the beginning of this gateway in the beginning of this, this open corridor of beautiful, uh, open space with with smart<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4439.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the water and electricity, whether we have the traffic and parking concerns answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4446.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are things that have been concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4448.969s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They haven't been answered for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4451.487s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, and I love the idea that you want to vote for it because we put this in place for this purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4456.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't put it in for this purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4458.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We put it in for this purpose to start the development process so we could grow an area, not just pop up one building that neighbors are directly affected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4468.92s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as a matter of fact, what neighbors are they?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4471.041s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're not the neighbors on Lawrence Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4474.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're not the neighbors on Grove Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4476.165s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're the neighbors that we talk about every day that are always impacted negatively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4481.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this building's gonna come right up in front of their homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4485.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Their buildings, this one building is gonna impact an area that traffic-wise has been stressed to us before these gentlemen even came to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4495.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what I ask our director, is there a plan in place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4500.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know there's a comprehensive plan that's out there and that we reviewed, but is there something that we could see tangibly, hold on and look at and say, wow, look at the beginning of the growth of this corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4584.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4584.98s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the answer is no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4585.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there really isn't something there yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4587.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So why rush?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4591.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4591.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I remember in a little community next door, they settled for this company called IKEA to go in the middle of their plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4603.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then once it blew up, what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4606.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Once it's really took off, what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4608.221s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They had to reach out to this company and say, we have to move you because the vision has changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4614.663s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No disrespect to anybody here, but we don't have a vision yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4618.764s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All we have in Wellington is somebody that wants to build there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4622.805s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4623.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All we have is this organization that wants to just build on Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4627.827s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's do it then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4629.839s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't see anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4630.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, we have one bite.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4632.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're the only, only community left that abuts Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4637.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is valuable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4638.842s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't, we're not begging for anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4640.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is valuable, valuable development space that we should grow with responsibility and make sure we have all the factors in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4651.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We already said it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4652.407s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have all the factors in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4655.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna prove this without knowing if it's gonna handle the safety of that roadway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4659.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if it's gonna handle the traffic of that neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4664.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, again, it's nothing personal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4667.705s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something I've been saying, whether it's you or any other company, any other development company that's here right now, we need development seriously bad in Metro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4677.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done nothing in the last four years, nothing, zero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4681.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But because of that inability to grow,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4687.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we've now left ourselves in a pretty valuable situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4691.065s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So as our director just said, if we can wait 18 months, we're gonna have a better opportunity here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4699.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At least that's the way I'm looking at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4700.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe I shouldn't say verbatim, but that's what I just heard, that they were off at 18 months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4705.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So imagine if we wait 18 months, what the vision and what answers we can have to make sure that Florida fits everything we want for those neighbors that again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4716.164s">[Scarpelli]</a>: are always the ones that people don't look to support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4721.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know because I'm getting the information from them on a regular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4727.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, listen, I don't wanna be the catalyst and stand here and say, follow me, but you have to understand that this isn't personal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4736.548s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is one Councilor that's fighting for the neighbors of that community that still don't know what that card is gonna look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4744.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All they know is we're putting an eight story building jammed into a little area of the corner with no parking and still have issues with traffic, safety,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4756.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in infrastructure issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4758.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=77.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=78.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=79.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=81.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just wanted to send congratulations to one of methods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=86.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Greatest couples.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=87.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You could still see them driving down Lawrence Road or Winthrop Street in their Cadillac going really slow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=96.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Mrs. Brady.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=97.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, they're a great example for all of all of us as they're celebrating the 70th wedding anniversary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=105.436s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, two amazing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=108.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: amazing people that have done so much for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=111.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, the Children all involved in Medford, um, whether it's coaching or, uh, um, giving back to their community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=123.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've done an amazing job and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=126.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: great Medford people and just wanted to wish them a happy and 70 more years on their wedding anniversary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=215.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he outlasts you at all the polling locations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=731.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One question we had, what are the other restaurants doing in that area?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=736.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's very similar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=738.105s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Ours are very similar for what this business is asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=743.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything is in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=744.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've had no complaints to date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=747.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I wouldn't hold this off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=751.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that if we can, we usually do some sort of review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=755.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: maybe a 30 and 60 day review to see if it's had any negative impacts to the community, the neighborhood, but I would move forward with this in favor of that, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=855.824s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=951.477s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=952.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=952.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that when the request came in for the new ownership, change of ownership, nothing changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=962.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But unfortunately, at the time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=965.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that with new management, the prior permit went with the owner, so we requested for you to come in and you've done everything that's needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=976.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we had one, as we went through the process, just one thing you should take note of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=982.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=985.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: there's we haven't had many complaints at that area we'll ask for another 30 60 day review with the new ownership but at the same time there was one question about some cleanliness around the area especially in the later hours when other businesses come in the next morning there were some things that that were left you just want to make sure that that area is maintained<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1006.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there's some oversight there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1009.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Other than that, with the 30 and 60 day review, I would move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1013.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything is in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1015.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, this has been an existing business for many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1020.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the hours of operations, it wouldn't be fair to change those now for what was established for many years in that location with the same business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1798.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1799.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And thank you for this new initiative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1802.539s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I revert back to what we've been talking about for four years now and the lack of a true comprehensive plan of what vision<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1812.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what our city's true vision is, and when we talk about development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1816.159s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talk about all this, we see all this movement, like the spot development, whether it's looking at Mystic Ave, whether it's looking at the Apostle at Wellington and the air rights, whether it's looking at Medford Square, which we have, I think we already have hundreds of thousands of plans that are already written that we haven't looked at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1837.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think what we're doing right now is we're allowing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1843.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the city and really one department to make a decision what's greater for our community without the true input of what the community wants and the visions of what they see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1856.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've been screaming this for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1859.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's funny that we're a few months away from an election and all of a sudden we're being talking about Method Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1867.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: truly, I can't support this for the fact that we've been asking for a true comprehensive plan of what we want to do as a community, what direction we want to go in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1876.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we've been talking to Director Hunt and her department about putting in teams to come in and go to neighborhood by neighborhood and giving some direction of what we see and what we think Medford needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1893.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because right now, we're a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1896.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can't even drive into Medford Square without sitting in 45 minutes of traffic to get from one side of the city to the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1905.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So until, I appreciate the input of the knowledge of acquiring what the DIF is, but I think truly until we have a true comprehensive plan of what we envision Medford to be,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1923.18s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think this council should approve any sort of ordinance that approves anything until we understand what one piece will do to the other piece of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1934.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still haven't had these talks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1935.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't had, have we sat down with the mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1938.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Has this committee sat down with the mayor and talked about a comprehensive plan of what direction we want the city of Medford to go in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1945.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1946.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't, we're a few months away from election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1949.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We wanna talk about redoing Medford Square, cause it looks good on a flyer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1954.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just think that we need to slow down and do this the right way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1959.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I say this again, I remember when this disgusting area, when I started working 15 years ago in a neighboring community that people used to laugh at, it was an armpit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1972.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now it's one of the most popular,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1975.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: most exciting spots in Massachusetts to go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1981.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and that's Assembly Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1982.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now that's turning from Assembly Road down to Lowell Broadway, into Union Square, around the Highland area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1990.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a plan that they had in that community with the neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1994.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would sit in community meetings and we would look at what impact we would have with fire, police, recreation, what happens with traffic studies, everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2004.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We would sit together and we would create a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2007.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's how we grew that community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2009.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's why that community is so, so strong today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2013.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And why they have so much money they don't know what to do with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2016.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then guess what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2017.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A neighbor commuting next to them said, hey, that's a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2021.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's follow that same idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2022.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They got a little help with the casino, but now you're seeing that grow, that area grow, and it's growing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2030.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't see that here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2032.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because we don't have a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2035.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There isn't a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2036.258s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or if there is, it's a secret.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2039.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I'm not gonna move on to any, I stopped voting on money papers years ago because we still don't have true numbers of what the budget, the budget that was voted for this past year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2051.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We were told by the finance director those numbers were not true, but we still voted it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2056.456s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not going to vote on any money papers, and I'm sure not going to vote on any development issues right now until we sit with the mayor and understand what we have for a true comprehensive plan to see what direction Medford is going in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2070.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do we want to be Somerville?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2071.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do we want to be Winchester?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2073.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do we want to be something in the middle?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2075.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2075.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because right now, Councilor Caraviello has said it for years, we're the last piece of dirt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2085.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that developers can use now, closest to Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2088.264s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody else is dried up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2089.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They can't touch it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2091.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is valuable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2093.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To jump into anything because we got a grant for it, that's not responsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2099.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think that's responsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2101.11s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we need to see the biggest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2102.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Caraviello brings up a great point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2105.372s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Where does this ordinance, how does this play a factor in Wellington area?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2110.574s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How does it play a factor on Mystic Ave?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2112.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How does this play a factor in other areas in our community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2115.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And why wouldn't we use it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2117.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is a conversation that we're not talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2119.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're talking about things in little bunches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2122.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's do this little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2123.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's do this little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2125.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And nothing is truly getting done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2127.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why we don't have a true increase in our new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2132.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't see any of that, like neighboring communities have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2137.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have a true understanding with whatever growth we have, what it's going to do to our public servants and fire, police, DPW, and our school systems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2148.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are things that should be talked about as you start this process in Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2153.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2154.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we're putting the cot way ahead of this horse, saying, hey, let's get this done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2160.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: without understanding the true direction that we're going in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2162.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's why I appreciate the presentation, but I couldn't support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2168.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3251.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3252.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, this is a lively debate that I think it's interesting and it's informative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3258.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, it brings us back to the original question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3262.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this would be a great opportunity to use a great tool in our toolbox if we knew what the plan is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3270.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I love the idea that we want to work on Medford Square right now and use this tool, but understand something, without a true plan about moving one street and moving another street, how that affects the plan just right down the road on Mystic Ave or just down the road on Riverside Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3291.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or just down the road in West Medford Square, or just down the road in Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3298.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there are so many, if you look at what we're talking about here, it's a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3302.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a great tool in the toolbox.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3304.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The only problem is we don't have a toolbox yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3308.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one has anyone talked to anybody here because I haven't talked to anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3312.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I haven't sat with the team and said, this is our vision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3317.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a true comprehensive plan that the community is involved to sit down and deliberate and share their thoughts and where method's gonna go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3331.436s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor is putting thousands of committees and boards together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3338.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and these little bits and pieces like getting bit in the ankle over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3342.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It sounds great, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3344.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's a start, but start for what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3349.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What is it a start of?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3351.518s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because when you start something, there's a vision, there's a finale.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3355.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you have a starting point, your destination, your journey takes you somewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3363.666s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With this starting point, we don't know where it's going, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3367.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3368.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I all agree, we all agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3370.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a good tool if you had the opportunity to understand what we're looking at in totality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3377.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3380.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think it's just narrow minded that we're not thinking of the big picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3384.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're moving and changing things for the sake that you don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3389.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We keep talking about underserved communities and underserved parts of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3393.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know the impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3395.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: By changing this ordinance, you don't know the impact that's gonna have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3401.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You don't know the impact that it's gonna have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3404.73s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And has this plan talked about what happens with our infrastructure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3409.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have we talked about what's surrounded it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3411.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have we talked about the fire, police, teachers, the school department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3415.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I got a text this morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3418.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Schools are adding more kindergarten classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3422.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Classes are getting filled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3425.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and just keep adding it with no direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3429.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, this is a good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3431.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I agree with my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3433.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's a good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3435.165s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you had a plan that we can say, this is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3439.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the plan in Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3440.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is how it's gonna roll into probably one of the biggest opportunities we have, and that's Mystic Ave, especially along the highway side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3452.159s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have so many opportunities, but we don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3454.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right now, it's just people talking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3457.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's people talking and no one's, but there's no one leading us and saying, this is what we should do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3463.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's, we talked about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3465.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This council has talked with the development director and we've talked about putting in, you know, getting a zoning consultant in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3472.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've talked about getting a team in so we could sit down to see what zoning we want from Medford, what growth we want from Medford, what direction we want from Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3481.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if we keep changing these little pieces,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3486.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I use the parcel land we voted for in Wellington.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3491.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still have the air rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3493.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody keeps talking about the air rights with the T. Well, I found out the other day that the T wants that land.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3500.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The T's, and who's gonna get it first?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3502.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The T of the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3504.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who do you think's gonna get that first?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3507.756s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are the things I'm saying until we have focus on this in the back door, the T is coming in to negotiate what they want at Wellington station, where that could be a huge gateway to our community, what we want to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3520.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I appreciate everyone's input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3524.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a, it's a, it's, it's, it's a respectful debate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3527.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's, it's bring some make some great points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3529.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All I'm saying is I agree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3531.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That is a good tool, but I don't agree that we don't have a plan<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3537.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to use this tool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3539.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One part of the community that's small minded, that's narrow thinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3543.231s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to understand what we're looking at the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3546.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5131.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5133.427s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I was appreciate you mentioning that be nice that two years ago, we used to have a city solicitor that we can have here and help us as we go through this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5145.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had no idea that KP law would be here to help us along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5148.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we're talking about a very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5154.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, different situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5156.929s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, and I think that all we're asking for right now is just the opportunity to go to the next step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5163.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you know, the questions that people have in neighborhoods is, you know, as valiant as your, your, your, your heart and what you need is something that I would support in a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5175.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5176.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, this is something you took a chance on that land, but as your family grew,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5182.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to be a strong member of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5183.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, we've had a lot of obstacles and hurdles come in the way and you still want to be a strong member of our community with your family, and, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5190.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we should support this this evening and move it along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5193.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that they'll be hurdles along the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5195.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They'll be neighbors that are going to be mad about breaking ledge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5199.364s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They'll be neighbors questioning parking, and there's going to be questions about affordable<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5212.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If that's the question that we're just trying to move something down the road so we can maybe help a family that's in need right now, I think that we'd be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5224.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'd be speaking for myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5228.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would be foolish not to support a family that is looking for that support in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5234.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, we're not giving approval to build the Taj Mahal all we're looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5238.945s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council is asking for the family that we help them move on to the next step and then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5244.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we go from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5245.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's a no brainer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5246.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would move, um, if there is a motion that we need that I would move that forward this motion forward to, uh, to the next level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5254.794s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the house family can see if they can, um, support their family concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5259.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5362.096s">[Scarpelli]</a>: point of information for the ASKP law that if we amend this, that it would go with just the Alves family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5368.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it is transferred over, then that would, that restriction would have to come before the city council again at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5375.16s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I think that's an easy ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5376.52s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5392.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if we didn't want some developer to come in and put a ton of... Or we allow it to what the Alves family, the existing owner right now only.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5447.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, Matt, if we can, for clarity purposes,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5451.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for the simpletons in the room like myself, to the attorney, is it possible to grant the Owls family only for this purpose and not for the property or future property owners?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5473.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5486.64s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5487.02s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, again, this is just to build the process to go through the next step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5562.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One information, and again, but this is my, this is dilemma, the chicken, the egg kind of my, my concern would be the Alps families taking all the risks they're paying all the upfront they're doing, they're moving this for their family forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5580.888s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, as they move forward to restrict it and limit them for what they can, they can make on that part of their property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5589.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's a slippery slope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5590.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's already limited to none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5594.368s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I'm saying as you move forward, you also have a family that they just explained how, you know, as their family's growing with some need to restrict their possibility of greater growth to support their family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5609.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's, you know, that's a question that I'd have with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5615.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, that's why we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5739.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information, I know, but you're making this as if these were developers and I can understand that fight, but these aren't developers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5748.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are residents that have lived in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5751.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so I think there is a difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5754.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and I think the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5757.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the situation plays a huge factor in my decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5761.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I wouldn't, like I said, I would move approval for the deed restriction to be lifted so we can move forward with this and that it stays with the Alves family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5771.855s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That if it's changed after that, that then it has to come back to this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5776.796s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5778.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5779.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5966.005s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5966.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wish we had that much fire for developers that are destroying our communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5971.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5974.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'm hearing right now, this is the process to move it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5979.079s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then we could discuss with the fire department about what's needed or if it's even possible to move forward with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5987.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is a simple ask that would move this family's worries into a better direction and we'd get some answers that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5997.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Moving this to another meeting is just,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6003.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: making this longer than it should considering all the processes that you just talked about can be moved into the next phase as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6011.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe I don't think this is anything that that's groundbreaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6017.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if we vote this forward tonight, that can't be adjusted as it moves forward for all of the different hurdles that residents have to go through when they're looking to, I believe it was support a family member, not moving him or them to outside services or into housing, but they want to look to take care of their own<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6042.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: on their own property and the property that they're requesting and without the burden to anybody else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6050.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's valuable and I would still support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6056.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I have a motion on the floor, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6059.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6905.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6908.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's come to my attention that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6911.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: our turf fields are in disarray.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6914.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And although we appreciate all the hard work going into all of these grant funded parks and playgrounds, I think our city administration has forgotten about the existing fields.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6929.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is something that I've been putting on the agenda for years, hoping someone would listen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6937.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, when I'm gathering from some parents, they're a little nervous, especially what's happening in Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6944.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The field is a turf field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6946.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The field does have black pellets, but the field hasn't been tested for GMAX.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6952.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now what the GMAX study does is it should be tested every year, this is what we do in my profession, on a turf and natural surface fields to make sure the density is safe after a long period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6965.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The Field of Dreams was started back in early 2010.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6969.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're now coming on to 2024, and the life expectancy of a turf field that is maintained properly, that means to come in and groom it on a regular basis, that means on a yearly basis, coming in and doing a deep clean, that means taking the pellets up,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6991.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: re-grooming the surface and then re-entering the pellets, which, from what I gather, we haven't done on a consistent basis here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7002.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What was brought to my attention, the way I brought this up, is that as soon as someone says safety to me, I have to present it in a resolution so the city can get back to us in a timeline that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7018.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: God forbid somebody gets hurt and those tests weren't done, then the liability, and if the attorney's still here, this would be great because I know if the city solicitor were here, I know that that would be something very important to stress the fact that getting that test done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7035.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, what I request is the city administration to have a licensed turf<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7046.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: contractor come in with a GMAC study for turf, not natural surface.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7051.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're two different tests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7053.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they do a test at Edgley Fields behind the high school, the fields at Hormel Stadium, and from what I gather, the field at the Brooks School is absolutely deplorable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7069.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's probably one of the most used playgrounds in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7075.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know our school age kids at the Brooks love that field considering what they had years ago and the mud bowl that they used to have to and then bring it into the school and it started destroying the floors at the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7091.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The community really put a good effort, but they forgot again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7096.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: an existing playground and park and Metro completely forgotten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7100.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unless you can cut a ribbon, unless you get a big grant to do it, unless someone does something that does some work to do that stuff, we've completely forgot about our regular fields, our fields that are still existing, that our kids are on every single day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7113.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7115.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would recommend, I would make the motion that we ask the city administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7121.304s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know if it falls under the facilities manager.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7124.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did we hire a facilities manager?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7126.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7127.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe that facilities manager, because at least in my role, we have a facility manager that actually oversees the parks as well as the actual buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7136.247s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If that falls under that person or the new, I guess there's a new director of parks that we can get a report back<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7145.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7146.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Kids are on those fields today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7148.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would hate for a kid, a young person to fall tomorrow at a game and smash their head on a on an area that hasn't been tested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7157.553s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we are held that first of all the safety of that that that young individual and then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7163.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what can happen later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7165.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a father of a son who saw a neurologist on a regular basis because of concussion issues, I take this very serious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7177.544s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one of the things, one of the most important pieces as we've gone through studies and now part of a working program that my son is actually involved in, that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7191.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: realizing the fields that he was playing on caused the concussions, not the head butting, not the physical bump to bump, but the actual falling on the turf as a goalie onto a turf that wasn't tested properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7208.164s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that we need to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7210.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We, I didn't realize until parents said, you know, have you gone up to the soccer field, soccer game, that these fields are terrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7217.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It looks like all the pellets are washed to one side, that, you know, that they're not safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7224.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I was a proud member of that committee that built those fields in 2010.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7230.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we asked for is putting a fee aside, an identified fee with every renter,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7237.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And over that 10 years, we would be able to replace that turf.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7240.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Obviously, no one followed through with that control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7246.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think the city management, the administration has to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7251.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: report back to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7252.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to, it could be done in two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7255.429s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's important that it's done in two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7257.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that they need to immediately go to all the fields, get the certified turf pro to come out to do those GeoMAX studies, and then go out to, especially from what I'm hearing at the Brooks, that the carpet now is, it's coming up on the scene.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7274.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now again, in my profession, a little maintenance,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7279.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to those fields, it's simple as this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7283.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Vacuum in the pellets, adding liquid nail down, patting it back down, and then putting a weight on top of it for 24 hours, and we don't have those dangerous issues anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7295.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then re-entering the pellets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7300.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's simple, but no one's doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7303.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we need, you know, I'd like to get a report back in two weeks if the clerk can make that as part of the motion, because it's brought to my attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7314.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now that it's brought to my attention, I think that we have to move on this quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7318.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And believe me, I would hate, I would hate to see what happens if they have to close those fields.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7325.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because we didn't do the preventative maintenance that we typically haven't done in our facilities so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7335.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I hope that answers that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7338.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope that you understand that, Mr. Clerk, and thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7378.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, especially in Somerville, because of the growth, and we're seeing that in Medford,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7385.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: natural surface fields have to have a resting period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7390.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to maintain, thank you, to maintain a natural surface field in the East Coast right now, it's impossible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7398.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unless you're an affluent community that has the ability to have six natural surface fields and rotate those fields.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7406.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you, I was directly involved, again, because of my son, the biggest concerns are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7413.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, the toxins that are in the pellets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7417.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we've done, we've had some major strides with looking at more environmentally safe products.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7426.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We tried coconut husks, then we realized we had kids that were allergic to coconut husks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7432.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what we've done in Somerville is now we use a soft wood pellet<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7437.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that has to be maintained on a daily basis because when it rains or wind blows, it pushes the pellets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7443.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it's safer for the environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7447.362s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's needed because we don't have many fields in our community that I work in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7452.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And believe us, I think we, I personally, I agree for a son that played Division One soccer and played soccer his whole life, I understand having natural surface fields.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7464.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what we all want but unfortunately in the east coast especially and being a city like Medford that's community like metric it's very difficult to maintain all of the youth activities and sports and um and do that i know that you know we've been very fortunate that you know that um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7483.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've had an athletic director that he's always been on the forefront of making sure that these tests are done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7491.035s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate that, but it's the trend that we're seeing, not just at the high school, we're seeing it all over the city and having the tools and understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7502.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And back in the day, there was always, I don't even know if the battle is over, who has the high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7508.466s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it the city or is it the schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7511.69s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't know if that's ever been, been, you know, delineated yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7516.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but again, like Councilor Bears, I know I could talk or buzz it off a meat wagon, but yeah, I wish we could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7522.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My preference is a grass field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7524.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, it's very difficult to have a grass field and use it the hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7530.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have one grass field in Somerville and we kept it at the Argenziano School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7535.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're ecstatic that we kept the grass field and we've had to condemn it because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7542.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, the dogs, um, dig up holes now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7546.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now there are so many, they call landmines, park landmines all over the city, all over the field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7552.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had to close that field down and, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7556.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, it's not, you know, like I said, we want it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7559.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We really do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7559.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We want one natural surface fields, but it's very difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7586.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, we can combine them if we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7598.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can't, if I, I'm sorry, Councilor, I just, I don't wanna, I just got information that the field was tested and they do it two times a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7606.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's good news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7607.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's great news that I appreciate the information that the information that I received was wrong and I don't wanna spread misinformation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7616.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's great news and we appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7620.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7661.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information, again, that poses another question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7665.115s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it the PACS department that rents those fields, or is it the Brooks School that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7672.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we should police that better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7674.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have two fields in our community that I work in that are only used for U-12 and under.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7681.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: no adults can be on those fields and SPD know that if anybody's on there or the neighbors know they call recreation we send somebody down and we send PD down they just right from the car say please get off the field you have the permit and and that's probably the reason why it is this yeah and I say I you know I've gone there before and said that and I was I won't tell you what was said to me but um if you know that what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8140.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8142.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8142.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I appreciate your hard work because I know that that's the reason why I brought it up again, because it seems to fade and it's not fading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8152.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's getting worse with the rats and the rodents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8154.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8157.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's now creeping into parts of the community that you wouldn't typically see rodent infestation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8163.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're seeing them, you know, typically saw them around the sewer systems, but now you're seeing them in the ledge areas in different parts of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8172.293s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8174.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to really have the voice of our public health, our city DPW director, and really sit down and share with the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8186.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we've made some changes that we asked for our health department to want private property if you see a nest or colony or whatever they call it now, but people don't know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8201.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had a neighbor call me and they said they can't do this because it's on my neighbor's property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8208.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, no, we now have made some changes that we just have to get permission and we could stop those nests that are maybe on your neighbor's property, but they're coming into<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8223.221s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was, a neighbor sent a video from a home at Felsway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8227.423s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I tell you, I thought he got it from, I thought it was a video from a movie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8233.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he had a train of rats walking down his garden wall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8240.91s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he showed, they went right into a hole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8245.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it was, to me, it's just, we need to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8250.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: something that I know that can't be fixed in one day but we need a plan that involves every corner of this community because it's coming from everywhere you know you're not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8262.01s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, you're seeing it in West Medford, you're seeing it in Wellington, you're seeing it in North Medford, you're seeing it in South Medford, you know, you're seeing it in the Heights now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8269.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, you know, when you see it in God's country, that's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8285.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a great selling point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8287.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But thank you, Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8540.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm going to have to, um, if this is, uh, to speak on any changes to solar in, uh, as part of the discussion, um, I'd have to separate myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8553.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I do now own a solar company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8556.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, so I'd have to step away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8559.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8560.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8561.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: George Scarpelli does care about the environment, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8564.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why I'm going to separate myself from this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8568.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9035.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First, I'd like to move approval on the donation, but just a little bit on Kevin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9039.544s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Kevin and I are colleagues now in different communities, but we often<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9043.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh, collaborate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9044.459s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, um, I don't think people realize how lucky we are to have Kevin here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9049.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, the adaptive program, I know I've been trying very hard for years to get it off the ground, and Summerville making sure that, uh, we are full inclusionary, making sure that all of our young people and adults have an opportunity to participate in multiple recreation opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9066.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, uh, you know, when you have, uh, a leader like Kevin,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9070.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: who presents these programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9073.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know he works very closely with partners across the state, and now you're having different organizations donating, and thank you for that organization to donate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9084.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's very kind of them, and I know it's gonna go a long way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9087.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd be remiss to say I'm a little jealous tonight because this, I believe it's this week,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9095.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Coming up soon, Kevin was asked to be a representative, I believe, to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9102.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: be the keynote speaker at the Recreation on the Statehouse and Kevin will be speaking on recreation and that's a huge feather in his cap for what he's done in a very short time with very limited basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9117.768s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To be honest with you, I can't tell you, I won't tell you publicly what our department and I won't tell you that I have 12 full-time employees and 100 part-time employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9129.313s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and to see what Kevin does with only three full-time employees and only a few part-time employees I think it's a huge feather in his cap and I think it's something has to be acknowledged publicly that when you are asked to speak at the Statehouse and out of all of the recreation departments<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9151.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: across the Commonwealth and having our director be that speaker, I think it should be mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9157.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not jealous, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9158.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not upset.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9160.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not, I mean, just because he's probably stolen a thousand different ideas from me doesn't mean that it shouldn't be me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9167.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But on that note... Do you have a professional crush on Kevin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9170.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm joking, I'm joking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9172.52s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I do I do but again I appreciate Kevin's hard work but I had to mention that Kevin I'm sorry I know you get you get a little embarrassed about that but when we call you out on stuff like that but again when you have such limited limited funding and limited staffing but still do what you do I think it's a has to be mentioned when you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9197.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as celebrated like you are right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9199.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=61.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=64.041s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I apologize, I was talking to Councilor Villes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=70.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked knows my fault.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=72.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, is that Mr?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=75.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I apologize for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=77.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, we just recently lost another pillar of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=82.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A gentleman that, um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=84.963s">[Scarpelli]</a>: gave to the youth of Medford as a hockey coach and always happened to go to his services the other days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=94.331s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's Mr. John Garrity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=96.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Garrity was one of my favorite parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=101.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: His son Jay was my captain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=102.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: His son Chris played for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=107.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was always willing to help, never a negative word, whether he thought I played his kid too much or too little.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=114.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was just a good sounding boy, a Method legend in his own right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=120.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Listened to some stories the other day and hearing the stories on the playground and on the ice and playing pond hockey really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=133.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: summed it up what kind of person Mr. Garrity was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=135.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was a tenacious individual who loved life, loved Medford, and loved his family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=142.91s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that with the passing of his son, Jay, I know it was very difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=149.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Jay was a very big piece in a lot of people's lives, but I'm sure when a dad loses his first son, I think it must have played,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=159.913s">[Scarpelli]</a>: very big part in who he was after that and I know that he was a rock for his wife and I know that Mrs. Garrity is one of the leaders in our community in making sure that we don't forget the issues of drug addiction and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=182.779s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the Garrity family really keeps that on the front page and making sure that they're solid advocates for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=190.842s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we did unexpectedly lose Mr. Garrity a few weeks ago and just wanted to send our condolences to the Garrity family and he will be missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=203.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=382.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello and Knight for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=384.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that another great family metric, not just a camera store, but Hunt Drug now, if you wanted lessons, if you wanted to do different trade shows, the farmers are always willing to even come into the community to run programs for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=405.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=406.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, with, you know, Gary and I coach, I was fortunate enough to coach a great athlete in Gary Fava.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=413.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think he's missed a three point shot to this day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=416.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think Larry Bird's the only person that rivals him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=419.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that, you know, it is an amazing story of a local family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=423.969s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that have done amazing things, but what I really am impressed about is how they always give back, whether it be the veterans or school programming, and it's something that they never forgot their roots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=436.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want to congratulate them as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=437.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1688.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1933.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As such, move for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1936.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I second that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1987.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll present if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1991.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are projects that are already in place, and these are just the additions to finishing projects, something that's why we voted for the CPA, the great project, so move forward to approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3403.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information, Madam Mayor, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3407.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think what you're doing is unbelievable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3411.071s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What you're doing right now is a good example for the rest of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3414.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have to have a task force, just people caring about the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3417.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to hear that about, you know, Emory Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3419.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's people that are reaching out to us that unfortunately we don't have the court enforcement department we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3425.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3426.698s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5189.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a few different issues when it comes to our handicapped community and the lack of respect, whether they were having a city event and they're blocking handicap ramps or issues like what we're hearing tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5204.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, I know that the, I know that Neil Osborne used to have the position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5217.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is so frank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5218.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Has anybody can we actually make a motion to send that to Francis as well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5222.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think this is an issue to with the Disability Act that it's not just the T issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5228.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's just not, you know, a situation with with, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5234.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, Todd Blake, but this is also something that legally that the city has to get involved in, and we can send, you know, our enforcement agency to look at that as soon as possible to see if something could be remedied sooner rather than later, because if we wait for the T, they'll be building a blue line going through Metro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5256.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we could do that, I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5260.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5815.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5819.209s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to say it, but I'm going to say it, but I told you so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5824.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had an opportunity this budget season to hold the mayor's feet to the fire, and we didn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5830.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The answer to Councilor Tseng's resolution is very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5833.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's called a city solicitor, an assistant city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5839.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's unheard of in the state of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5842.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the city of this size, not having a team of city solicitors representing the residents, the council, of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5856.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're finally getting some redacted bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5860.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe it was last month, maybe you can correct me, I believe it was over $100,000 K.P.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5866.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5866.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe this month, last month that we just got, a slow month,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5871.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe it was another $60,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5872.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct me if I'm wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5876.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is money we're paying to a law firm that doesn't have to answer to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5885.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is what's frustrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5886.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are basic necessities we need that every city needs to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5895.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even tonight, some of the resolutions we're going through, we're talking about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5898.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm afraid to open my mouth because we have no legal representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5903.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because one one of our residents came up and said, Well, you're starting to pick on people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5908.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't disagree with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5910.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the fact that we don't have legal guidance to say careful how you say this, because you could be sued, because that's happened to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5919.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did we not forget that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5922.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're still in court with it with the BJ situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5926.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5930.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for bringing this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5932.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, for the neighbors, what's going on in that neighborhood is ridiculous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5937.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, again, the fact that we don't have code enforcement officers is another big issue, but we wouldn't know that because we couldn't discuss these issues at the budget hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5955.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the mayor got what she needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5958.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She got her four votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5961.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now here we are again, bringing up these same things and sounding like a broken record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5966.453s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I will tell you, I, on the school committee, we realized we had the toughest mayor that negotiates in years, and Mike McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5978.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when we needed things done for our school department, the school committee stood together and would not vote a budget until we got what we needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5990.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know people don't like to hear this, but that's politics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5994.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's part of the whole gamut of why we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6000.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This mayor is doing whatever she wants to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6004.761s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't see any benefit for our community, whether it's neighbors with Airbnbs, or whether it's a simple question that people, no one's picking up the phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6017.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm frustrated, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6019.373s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not as animated, because I think I'm getting tired of being so animated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6023.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, this is a very simple issue, very simple solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6028.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hire a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6032.716s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hire an assistant city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6038.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In most communities, that's like saying, breathe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6044.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7035.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7037.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think it's time to maybe make a motion that we become a little creative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7042.071s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that working with the building department, the inspectional service department, maybe working with the unions, maybe we ask the city administration and the mayor to sit down with those unions like they do with the police department and bring in retired police officers and maybe pay them to actively<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7063.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to go out and do, you know, assist with the code enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7069.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, you know, especially with our retired police officers, I think that might be an opportunity that we can think outside the box.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7077.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, you know, other communities use grant writers, bringing in grant writers and use grants that they would write to bring in money to our community and pay them through that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7089.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe there's an avenue there that they, you know, having some incentive that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7093.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we can, you know, do a few things at once where we're sending more people out, qualified people out, to understand our code enforcement and start, like our neighbor said, is start policing it better and giving them the avenues that we haven't given them at budget time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7118.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to make that form of motion that we ask the mayor administration to look into that process to try to immediately enhance the code enforcement office, both with the health department and the building department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7549.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, I think anybody that can be trained for that, Councilor Knight, that works with the union and the code enforcement department right now that can do something that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7560.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: can assist with these concerns and issues so we get ahead of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7981.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we could amend that too, Councilor Knight brought up a good point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7985.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Per diem payments<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7990.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to assist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7993.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, if you can add that to that amendment to that B paper that add that or either word it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8003.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8003.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8007.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As she's been doing, as the mayor has been doing multiple times in multiple positions in City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8012.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8950.663s">[Scarpelli]</a>: President, I appreciate bringing this forward as a strong union supporter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8956.424s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I support anything dealing with unions, but I,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8962.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would be remiss if I didn't bring up the fact that we're talking about, we're talking about RAs from Tufts University.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8969.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if I recall back, we talked about our own unions being affected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8975.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and Councilors that are sitting here talking about the effect that it had, you know, on the process of moving forward on a nonunion contract is because maybe we need to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8988.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to help things going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8990.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Remember those conversations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8992.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a fire department that hasn't had a contract in almost 800 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8997.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have secretaries that didn't have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9000.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a contract for six years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9001.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're talking about the RAs at Tufts University, a contact at Tufts University today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9006.613s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And boy, I tell you what, correct me if I'm wrong, free room and board, free meals plan, stipend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9016.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when I talked today with the representative of Tufts University, that's what they told me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9020.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not to say, I'm just sharing to you what they've told me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9024.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm just, and you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9026.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what I'm saying is this, understanding that, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna vote for this because I think any union, any person that wants to work together as a union and have representation, you can never deny it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9042.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I just want you to realize and understand<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9044.953s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's a good point to bring it forward that we have unions right now in our own backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9049.316s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My father always told me, don't worry about your neighbor's backyard till you clean your own backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9054.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 800 days, 800 days without a contract for a firemen and women.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9059.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They sat through the pandemic, the first ones they applauded how great they were, how amazing what they've done for our community, going into the homes where people are dying and putting their lives first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9072.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm using this, yes, I'm using it as a platform that I hope you understand why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9077.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's for the fact that we have unions in our own community right now in Medford, hardworking men and women residents that live here all year round that haven't been treated fairly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9091.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, two wrongs don't make a right, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9093.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm going to support this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9095.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's a very important paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9097.289s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's why I share what the representative from Tufts University told me today, so we can all understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9104.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the difficult part about negotiations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9106.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You hear what you want to hear, what they want to say, to make it sound good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9110.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But who's affected?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9111.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's the employee, the worker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9114.313s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I think we need to look at our firefighters, because I think, listen, unified message next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9121.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What can this mayor do to support our firefighters?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9126.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Update us right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9128.868s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the negotiations now are now in arbitration, it's out of our hands, but what else can we do for our firefighters that we're showing them the unity, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9140.29s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That they're standing together and saying, what are you gonna do for them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9145.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=958.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=962.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You made a great presentation for the city of Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=966.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You said Broadway five times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=970.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is what we've been talking about here in Medford, with the lack of the movement with our zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=980.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: consultant to look at what Medford wants to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=985.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so I just think that you said some things with the neighborhood, but I know the neighborhood on the Medford side has a real problem with this area right now because of some fears and because of lack of true understanding where we're going in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1003.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The spot development, we're seeing that happen all over the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1007.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But these are the issues that I find being a problem when the council for the projects has mentioned how it appeals to Broadway, which isn't Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1024.453s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I tend to be a little leery, that's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1028.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1145.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would really, again, when you're talking about a project like this and what it affects and when we're doing it, where we're not having meetings, I think that's a slippery slope again, councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1158.842s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would recommend that you wouldn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1523.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1525.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you're taking over the boils?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1527.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1529.423s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So Madam President, I see everything in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1532.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Before I open up, there is one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1535.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You were applying for workman's comp.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1537.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that completed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1540.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It says that you were going to apply for your insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1548.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1551.159s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President to the clerk, if the gentleman could just forward you that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1556.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would move in favor, as long as you have that document in hand tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1562.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to hold it up, but if we can do that, if you said you have it, just send a copy, then my recommendation would be to move and approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1570.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as long as the clerk has that tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1577.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1578.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1578.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1578.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1668.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, can we just dismiss 23-386 please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1690.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1691.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sure that everybody's heard and everybody's, it's not just in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1696.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a pretty severe issue, all over the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1702.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, you're hearing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1705.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you're hearing that now that you're seeing this rat infestation, not just in where they traditionally would find them, you know, close to restaurants or close to water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1715.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now you're finding them in areas like the Heights where most of the homes there are ledge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1724.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so it's starting to become even more disturbing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1728.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that the Board of Health is super busy, but I think we need to find<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1735.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, an avenue where we're putting together a serious team that's devoted to this issue right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1743.796s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's what we're seeing right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1746.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, residents contacting us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1749.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then I know that the Board of Health is responding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1754.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: piece mail, I know that something was sent out, and it was forwarded by one of the residents, one of the residents that reached out to me, and who requested this resolution be brought up that now the what we've been talking about for a while is having the possibility of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1774.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The Board of Health, as long as the homeowner is willing to allow them on their property, they're willing to do some abatement on private property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1781.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In the past, that's been an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1783.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know this council moved forward to try to find a solution where we have the Board of Health work together with residents because one of the questions back maybe two years ago was that you could see the nest<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1798.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but unfortunately the exterminating company couldn't go one foot to that nest that had the issue because it was on private property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1808.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we need to do a better job communicating with not just people that are complaining, but I think the community as a whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1819.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then really look at some sort of a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1821.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1823.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody's saying that, well, some of it's development, the movement of the streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1827.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Here's the thing, we haven't done much development and we haven't really fixed many streets and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1833.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when you're seeing projects like tonight that are coming up, we're gonna see some more movement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1839.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna see some more, we're gonna see greater projects and we're gonna see the earth being moved in a greater capacity, which means<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1849.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: more of that rat infestation moving from, you know, from one area to the rest of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1857.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, we do have a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1859.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the resident that contacted me, that the Board of Health moved to support that neighborhood, but once we heard that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1872.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the feedback I got was this isn't just in one neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1876.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This neighborhood was in the Heights, by the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1878.981s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But then I got phone calls when I put this resolution up, I had phone calls with, I had phone calls South Medford, I had phone calls West Medford, the Hillside, I had phone calls in the Wellington area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1893.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it was, it really stirred the nest, to say the least.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1899.745s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we really need to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1902.187s">[Scarpelli]</a>: really be proactive right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1903.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, when you're talking about the summer, in a few months,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1910.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: rodents are going to leave the exterior of our neighborhoods and now try to find homes and businesses to infiltrate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1922.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think if we can, I know that we put it out there, I would make a motion that we have a meeting with the Board of Health and any other department that needs to be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1934.671s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1936.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, whether it's DPW or code enforcement that we bring all the parties together to try to find a way to put a program in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1950.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I'm not gonna, I know neighboring communities, I've talked to neighboring communities and they've had remediation plans that don't, that go, they're pretty deep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1962.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It doesn't look at just,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1963.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, baiting catch basins and putting in traps, they're really looking with different entities to bring in to help us stop the reproduction of the rats in their nests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1977.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I know it was a little winded, but I think this is serious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1983.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that it's coming up a lot and we don't hear any solutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1990.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would make the motion that we,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1993.663s">[Scarpelli]</a>: contact the board of health, the code enforcement, the DPW department, and someone from the mayor's office for communications to try to find a way that we send out a detailed plan and try to at least get the information that's needed to help this process along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2010.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2389.666s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2392.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As I'm going through the, everything looks good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2395.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, what are your hours of operations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2399.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're keeping the same operation hours as current.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2406.01s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that that's my question, my fellow councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2408.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe that when we allow a special permit for extended hours, it goes, is it, do we see any restrictions with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2417.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I, cause I don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2421.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, so seven o'clock to 11 o'clock, is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2424.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2426.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, so that's the issue, cause we allow a certain,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2433.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: hourly certain hours and then to go to the two o'clock request at 1030 to 10am 1030am to two you have it stretched off and the requested hours that asked you have to come back for a special permit for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2449.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, as we approve this, the hours have to change so 11 o'clock until the special permit is heard is on the petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2459.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It says requested hours 10 30 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2461.929s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then it's crossed out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2463.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You had two a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2465.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then below it is seven a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2467.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to 11.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2485.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2485.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'm telling you, you can't do that until<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2489.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The permit that's requested in front of us is a request from 7 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2493.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to 11.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2494.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To extend those hours, you have to come in front of us with a special permit for extended hours use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2503.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: By changing over, the ownership changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2507.65s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The vote that was taken in the past is dismissed, and now it starts again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2529.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2534.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, if we could do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2535.041s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't wanna hurt you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2535.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just wanna make sure this is, you get everything you need in place so there isn't an issue later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2544.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2545.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would move forward with the petitions request right now in favor and the petitioner contact the clerk in the morning for the extended hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2755.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, were there any other clauses that aren't in this that any stipends or anything else that was added to this that we're not seeing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2767.571s">[Scarpelli]</a>: COVID money or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2802.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, it's okay, I just, I trust you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2804.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we have the retro, that's involved as well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2809.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, I would waive any time restraints.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2812.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think these employees have waited long enough that we move forward and move this through as fast as we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2820.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I move approval, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=346.842s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=434.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, I looked at both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=438.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I did, I found them all, I found them in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=443.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd second the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=517.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=518.705s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=520.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Due to the rain, my schedule was diverted to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=524.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm in and out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=525.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I apologize for my absence in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=528.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But yeah, if I know this is exciting because I know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=535.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sushi is one of my family's favorite foods, but we wanted to make sure if the petitioner could give us a little brief description of their business, and then we can move on with my comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=571.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=572.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, just a couple of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=575.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We do see everything is in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=578.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The petitioner did everything they needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=580.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything is signed off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=582.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are you familiar with our hours or operations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=609.621s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=611.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the hours of operations that you're looking for, I know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=624.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=627.91s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I do see everything in order, and if my colleagues have any questions, I would move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=667.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, you can meet with the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=668.487s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that would, that might help you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=698.486s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=700.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=723.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you again, Madam President and the Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=725.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I do have all the paperwork, everything is in order, but if the petitioner could give us a brief description.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=733.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that boba tea is very, very popular, but just a description of your process would be important, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=770.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=771.913s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I see everything in order, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=777.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=778.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My colleagues have any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=840.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=841.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I'm glad to see with such changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=844.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we heard some sad news yesterday about a few establishments closing on Middlesex Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=851.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the very popular site of Tiki Island, I'm glad that there's someone taking this over and the reputable<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=863.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: owner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=863.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is all of the paperwork seems in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=866.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that just understanding the hours of operations that was an established business for a long time, and understanding the amount of employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=875.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that if we just got a brief description of what we're doing, and then just answer those questions, and then open it up to our call my colleagues, that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=929.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have done some little research and she is a reputable owner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=933.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we appreciate the opportunity to keep that business going, the Tiki Island spot going with such an owner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=943.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that the hours of operations, I'm trying to find it on the sheets that I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=951.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that-<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=968.949s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But that's what I just wanted to make sure we had that because I know a lot of the permits leave with the existing owner and their application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=978.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I do see everything else in order, Madam President, I would move approval after any comments that my colleagues might have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1018.407s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know council because was saying I think the Buddha is very very important that they keep it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1089.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1092.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't wanna waste anyone's time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1095.261s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm gonna be popping in and out, so instead of going and asking for individual votes to move forward, I'll text Councilor Caraviello when I pop back in, so I don't waste anyone's time, because I have to pop back into a program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1111.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=218.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, Madam President, I think that when the students did come up, you could see the excitement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=223.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'm proud of is really we sent a challenge out there and how everybody rallied financially to support<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=232.429s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this group so they can go and represent Netrid at that championship level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=236.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that, you know, they deserve all the credit they received from us, but it's glad to see that this community really supports our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=247.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=299.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, I can approach the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=321.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=324.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see a few friends here tonight and I'm glad they can make it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=331.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it was a few weeks ago, we had a very scary and horrific situation and dangerous situation occur over at the Tufts pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=342.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And something that would have really put our community, I think, in a real tailspin, and it would have affected so many lives in a negative manner, especially the young person that was drowning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=357.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I heard this situation, I was fortunate that my daughter is a lifeguard and she's trained by the best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=365.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I always thought, as the assistant recreation director, I have 40 lifeguards, I have two pools, and wanted to make sure that our staff is trained the correct way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=379.191s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's funny, because when I called Kevin and I said, Kevin, I'm going to put this up, he says, don't put our names on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=385.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not about us, it's about the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=387.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it wouldn't be fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=390.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if we didn't acknowledge yourself, Kevin, and Danny, folks, for your leadership in what you do for our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=399.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People don't know, I asked Kevin to come over and train my lifeguards in Somerville a few weeks ago, and I appreciate he did that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=406.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there's a reason for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=408.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's the best in the state at what he does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=411.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And for what happened that day,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=415.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, I had a great conversation with my friend Osman and said, you know, what happened and how graphic the whole situation was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=424.293s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you hear a kid drown, a kid who's drowning, what do you think?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=428.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's like, oh, he was flailing his, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=431.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To hear the whole description of,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=434.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, getting the call and the lifeguards all running into action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=437.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, and Osmond seeing the young person at the bottom of the pool and how, how was it called?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=442.331s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was, uh, he was pinned, I guess, face first on the, on the floor of the pool and everybody went into action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=450.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=451.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's something that needs to be told, and it needs to be elevated, and our lifeguards and our staff need to be congratulated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=461.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know the whole story, it's phenomenal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=464.821s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The buzz went around within 15 minutes around Medford, how Osmond went right in the water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=470.29s">[Scarpelli]</a>: did exactly what he was trained to do, bring him to the top, turn, the backboard was on site, staff was there, they took the person, the young person on the deck, everybody's in action, everybody, I know that the pool manager right away knew her role, the fire department was called, and in typical fashion, Osmond said to me, he says, no, Mr. Scapelli says, the firemen were amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=495.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's what the whole team, they all knew what to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=497.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because when I talked to the fire department, they said, no, no, it's a young person who jumped in and brought, all we had to do was get there and then do what we're trained for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=506.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's save a life on the deck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=508.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So between Armstrong ambulance and the fire department and Kevin's training,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=516.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I really wanted to do tonight is just acknowledge you as quickly as we can, because I know a lot of you young people off to college and we won't see you for a few months, but we contacted the clerk and he put together a citation for you that, you know, this is probably, I've given out a thousand citations, champions in sports, academic awards, music awards, right, drama club,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=545.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this is the most amazing citation that we're giving out tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=550.423s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm so I'm so happy for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=552.805s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because what you people did, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=556.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know chief chief just walked in, I said, I know, you know, give him kudos and his staff for what the fire department chief<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=564.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know you don't like the accolades and that's your job, but the fact that the firefighters and the lifeguards work together to save a life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=574.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so what we did is we put a citation together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=578.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It reads, the Medford City Council takes great pleasure in presenting this council accommodation to, this is our manager at the pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=589.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: From what I'm told, she's like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=590.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's like the den mother, and she's taking care of everything at the pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=594.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's Danielle DelBene.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=596.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And for your quick and heroic response and saving the life of a drowning youth at Tufts Pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=602.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you can come on up and take a citation, Danielle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=616.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then if you can, everybody knows how Zach likes to be taking pictures with everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=620.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're just going to take a big picture with everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=626.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=630.148s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You don't like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=631.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=634.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Next, we have Sophia Purifuri.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=654.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have Ellis Vasquez.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=675.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Coleman Jones, is Coleman here tonight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=678.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=683.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Arias Bravo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=708.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it Aja Bravo, oh, how is that I Tell you what, this is this is Kevin again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=735.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Osmond McCormack.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=753.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can, if everybody come right up front, I'd like to take a picture so we could send this off to the newspapers and make sure that everybody realizes what you did and how special people that you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=765.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So come on up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=993.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thanks, Chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1227.261s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1228.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I, you know, to that point, I know that I see it firsthand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1232.186s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when it's pouring outside, and Gianna asked my wife to get eight beach towels, because they have training and we said it's pouring, and it's 52 degrees out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1243.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we said, What is Kevin thinking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1245.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1245.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I take that all back, have whatever I was going to publicly tell you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1251.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is the reason why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1252.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And Janet, just like probably the rest of the lifeguards, they go gladly because situations like this because and people don't realize it's just not a it's just not a clean, safe pool all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1262.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1263.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: all of our lifeguards also train with your staff and yourself at the pond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1267.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's a difficult, especially with bad weather.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1270.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, and it's two different types of positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1275.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these kids really commit themselves and your staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1278.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, we appreciate what you guys have done and you made us look really, really good in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1284.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know there's one family that's very, very happy today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1286.582s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1287.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1946.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, just for clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1947.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This was just for at the time was for over 300 units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1950.911s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It wasn't mixed use correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1952.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My refresh my memory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1976.041s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate that you're here, because I think this is the question that I had back then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1980.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, especially with that area and getting a lot of feedback on what's happening there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1985.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what the T's interpretation of what their wishes are, and the rumors that what they want to do with that space and the airspace of that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1996.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's a lot of variables that are in place there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2000.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: miss out they said so I'm, I'm just a little concerned that what question I had back then was, what is our vision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2005.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, if you can share something with us because when you look at neighboring communities, and you know look at Linfield look at assembly row, look at station landing when that was done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2015.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was done with a comprehensive plan of what that whole area was going to look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2021.297s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In essence, we're looking at one piece of what else and I think that's what, you know, people are asking for and personally myself as a gateway entrance to our community exit to our community, you know what, what do we see there what we envision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2358.779s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so I appreciate the answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2360.92s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the biggest concern that I'm hearing from the neighbors<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2363.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And personally, I think that, you know, I was fortunate being a member of a municipality that was actually directly involved as we talked about with this new zoning consultant coming in plus the team that will be going out to each neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2378.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's important to get, you know, as recreation, I was in all meetings as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2383.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have to go represent recreation at the different neighborhood meetings to talk about the vision of that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2390.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that it's nice that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2392.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You, you explained it perfectly and I completely understand, but if we keep doing the spot zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2399.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's really not a big comprehensive, you know, master plan that everybody wants to share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2405.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that you get the word out as best you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2410.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: neighbors from that area, when you're talking about that area, they really, when we talk about this project after we voted the last time and they said 300 some odd units, what are we going to do with that neighborhood?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2419.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was nothing to calm them to understand what, you know, you're talking about Rivers Edge, you're talking about what's happening down the street in Everett, and now we're adding 300 more units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2431.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think having the community input, that's why I implore the city, the administration, to really, and I can make this form of motion, to give us an update where we are with the hiring of our consultants as well as partners so we can work together to get this done because, like you said, waiting a year and a half<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2452.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're not gonna wait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2453.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But imagine what we've already lost because we don't have a comprehensive plan, because we don't have the tools in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2459.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can get that going, if we can put that out, we'd appreciate it, Mr. Clerk, Madam President, and thank you for your answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2475.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just to share, I appreciate that, but again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2478.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when it's affecting neighbor direct neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2481.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand we post and we do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2483.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2484.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But you know, as well as I do, unless people are directly impacted, and they know what's going on, that they really don't know what's going until all of a sudden shovels in the ground, like no one told us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2493.65s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's not true, but it's what's then promoted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2499.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just wanna make sure that it's mentioned, it's not your fault, I know you do what you're supposed to do, but I think having this piece in place, and as we talked about, putting that piece with the zoning and having the team that's gonna go out to the neighborhoods and really get what everybody's input, I think that's what a true partnership is with the community and our zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2519.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2521.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3582.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that looking at the map, it looks like really the only public interruption is going to be on College Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3589.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I see that everything's been signed off and everything's approved by the engineer and the city electrical department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3596.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't see anything that will prohibit this council from voting, so I'll move to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3935.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3940.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I received many phone calls about a recreational vehicle that was parked at Medford High School for some days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3947.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I quickly called the superintendent and we had a great discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3952.763s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the understanding was that the word was that it was the registration came back to a school team member and the questions and the concerns of the neighbors saying that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3966.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, there was special treatment, that this isn't right, this is a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3972.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So instead of...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3975.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: continue with the back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3979.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I contacted the superintendent and what she said in her response, she sent this today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3984.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll read it if I can, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3987.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just for clarification, the superintendent did say that I am providing the following information in response to the listing of a motion on tonight's city council agenda offered by city council, George Scappelli, regarding the use of parking facilities in the grounds of Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4002.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The owner of the recreational vehicle currently parked in Method High School received permission after making a request to the high school principal who has full and appropriate authority over the use of school grounds, including parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4015.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The vehicle is set to be moved from the school grounds on or about July 14th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4020.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In the past,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4022.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With the explicit permission of the school department and buildings principal, school parking has been made available for use by individual Medford residents, other city departments, including the Department of Public Works and Public Safety Department, public and private contractors for temporary parking of construction machinery and other entities and organizations, including film crews working in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4046.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In each case,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4048.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the school parking space will not in any way impede or interfere with student employee or public access to school facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4061.159s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please feel free to contact me additional information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4064.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is exactly what the superintendent did say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4067.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, um, that's all it just clarification that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4072.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If this is the case, then it's given permission, then I think that's a new point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4078.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just wanted to make sure that I shared that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4081.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People have their own opinions one way or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4085.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, if residents are seeking permission to park a vehicle at the high school, there is an avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4091.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why I was asking for policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4093.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that that's probably the biggest<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4100.518s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I get out of this conversation and this resolution is if we can, just if this is common practice, which I don't disagree, we've seen commercial vehicles, we've seen other vehicles parked there, that the policy be made public because if this is an option, because we do have residents that from time to time have a very difficult time parking their boats or recreational vehicles or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4126.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, and sometimes during, you know, during for months now, this isn't again, this isn't all summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4131.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, as long as the policies, it's written, it's it's in, it's transparent, and I have no problem with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4140.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4228.745s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, if I can, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4231.907s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I was a strong, I was against the budget and anything dealing with funding for the city, especially after our hearing a month ago and the discussions of understanding that the numbers that were in the budget that were given to us weren't correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4252.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And until I see otherwise, I know Councilor Caraviello did his due diligence by reaching out to the company that provided those numbers to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4263.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They were very clear that the numbers that the financial director mentioned that this company was fraudulent in putting the numbers out, they were wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4275.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think Councilor Caraviello can speak to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4278.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They told us that those are the exact numbers that the city of Medford gave to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4283.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I will not support any money paper dealing with this year's budget because we still have many questions and many concerns of where this funding is coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4296.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5611.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5612.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President, for allowing me to speak on this because I did talk to the superintendent and I want to read.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5617.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that one of the one of the students, Stevie Rayner, he's who contacted me directly, wanted me to say say hi to him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5625.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he said, you know, and answer these the concerns that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5630.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, it's funny when things go out, and the discussion was that they're opening all the coaching positions for Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5638.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know this isn't a privy of the city council, but this is a forum that, unfortunately, as quickly as the word can get out, because this is an important topic, I talked to the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5652.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The word was on the street, and the superintendent and I discussed it in depth, that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5659.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We are now putting in a policy in the middle of the summer that will now open up all the coaching positions and the athletic director, the big question was the athletic directors were not involved in the hiring, that the process is skewed and this is, you know, witch hunts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5681.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: talk to the superintendent, the superintendent reassured me that the athletic directors are in full involvement with this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5691.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They will be on top of the situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5694.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that and I shared my own personal opinion as a 32 year coach and athletic director and understanding the process that I shared my concerns that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5705.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's where we've got some phone calls that during the fall season, the fall season starts in a few weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5710.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the process is in place right now to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5714.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: have a committee put together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5716.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the rumor was that it was gonna be just parents and kids hiring coaches, not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5723.821s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The superintendent and I shared what we do in neighbor community where I'm part of that as a former coach, I'm also involved in the hiring team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5734.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's between six to eight individuals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5737.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not two or three people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5738.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not people that are on there that don't like a coach that's sitting in the position right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5744.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a position where we have the athletic directors, the assistant assistant athletic director, the the athletic trainer, you have two sitting seniors or captains that are coming back that season, and alumni that played that sport.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5760.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You also have a parent and you have either a teacher in the school or a coach that's in the system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5768.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so it's a whole, it's a whole committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5770.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a true committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5772.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that, um, you know, that's, that's what we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5775.917s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's, it's very important that every school in the greater Boston league does that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5780.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I talked to, uh, athletic director Maloney, he met with the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5784.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They had a great discussion when I was told that the process is exactly what, what I just said, that that's the hope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5792.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, let's, let's, you know, not jump ahead of it, not,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5798.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it, you know, because kids are nervous, and I expressed the superintendent in this way, because of the fall season is what I'm a little concerned about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5808.423s">[Scarpelli]</a>: By the time the committee's put together, by the time the interviews are done, you're looking probably the middle of August, the season starts the third week of August.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5819.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Using football, for example, if the football coach is let go and a new coach comes in, you are giving the student athletes that have been involved with this coach the last three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5832.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is every sport, girls' soccer, boys' soccer, golf, volleyball.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5836.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: coaches that involved last two months with the student athletes working camps, giving back to the community, kids getting in shape.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5843.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The other piece that was was brought forth is you have coaches from colleges that are talking to student athletes, and they're discussing the possibility of being recruited and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5854.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to make a coaching change this quick might be detrimental for their future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5858.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the superintendent understood, we agreed to disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5862.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that, you know, I think the process in place is a fair and open process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5867.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's just like, like she said, it's an anomaly, because you have to start somehow, you have to start sometime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5873.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my wish was starting for the winter season, if this is a process we move to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5878.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I think the answer is very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5882.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5884.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The athletic director is involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5886.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a true committee, from what I was told by the superintendent, of a varied amount of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5891.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not just two people, a parent that doesn't like a coach, or a kid that doesn't like a coach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5895.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate letting me discuss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5899.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think publicly it needed to be said, because I don't think there's a forum, as we get closer to the season, that I think the kids wanted me to give an answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5908.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Their parents had reached out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5911.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate it, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=448.466s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information, Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=450.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think what Amy's talking about is these positions were all voted by members of this council, not unanimously, but it was voted by members of this group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=458.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what she's saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1027.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Amy Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1029.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand your frustration, and but again this is the fundamental issues we're having<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1035.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and society, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1036.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody wants to talk about supporting the union.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1039.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It sounds good, it looks good on your paraphernalia you're gonna mail out that you're supported or you're whatever for this, but I want you to realize, and I want my fellow councils to realize, this is something I've been saying from the beginning, any money paper that's come, unless it was urgent, I voted no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1058.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any vote for raises for non-union employees, I voted no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1062.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I implored, I expressed that to my fellow Councilors and they passed, unfortunately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1068.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I voted no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1070.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I will tell you is the other issue that I see, it's pretty damaging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1074.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you look behind you, I don't see one male.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1078.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't see one male employee that hasn't got when they need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1082.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know this council in the past have talked about the rights of women and making sure there's equality here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1088.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't see that either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1090.636s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So here's the thing, I'm not afraid either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1092.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I lived in this community my whole life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1095.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been an elected official since I left teaching in 2008.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1100.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not afraid to say what I have to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1103.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what I'm sad for you is you're being used as a pawn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1108.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unions are being used as a pawn, whether it's the lieutenant governor, whether it's the governor's office, whether it's state representatives or whether it's this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1117.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what can I tell you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1119.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can't tell you anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1120.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're going through horrible negotiations because nobody is standing up for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1124.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1125.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right now, I thought today, when I came here, I said, well, this is the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1130.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've talked about a council that have worked together pretty closely in the past year, making sure good initiatives get passed, even without any of the tools that were promised us last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1141.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is the time, when we vote later, you're going to realize where you should focus on, where the city should focus on, where unions should focus on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1151.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I'll be honest with you, if you keep giving and you keep giving, what is she gonna do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1158.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's gonna keep taking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1159.466s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Until what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1161.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You say stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1163.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Last year we said stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1165.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And at least we were heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1169.29s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At least we were heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1171.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With the presentation later with the budget, I know Councilor Caraviello has worked extensively in putting some numbers together, that when I think that people hear it, and if anybody would vote for this budget after you hear these numbers, it'll be appalling for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1187.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what I could tell you and your fellow colleagues that are getting the short end of the stick again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1195.051s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is all I could do is apologize from one city councilor to one department in the city that keeps us running every single day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1201.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I apologize that you haven't even have to go through this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1204.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a disgrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1207.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is sad for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1272.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You wouldn't know what compound is because you weren't given a raise for six years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1275.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that actually explained to you later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1276.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You wouldn't know that, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2307.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President, I appreciate the time and I would just tell you know, everybody has their own opinions of what they have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2314.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I too was a member of the negotiating team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2317.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a union members in the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2319.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I then battled for contracts for teachers as a city school committee member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2326.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm on the negotiating team municipality, neighbor community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2329.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm a union member, my parents have been union members their whole lives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2333.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One thing we've always learned and we saw it play out right in front of us when the country was going to close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2339.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2340.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Each party stood strong until they figured out what was best for what their needs were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2345.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here we are right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2347.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we've all agreed behind this rail, that making sure fair labor practices, making sure that there's equitable, equitable pay when it comes to our non union or union employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2358.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said that every single time a vote came up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2363.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if we stood strong, Amy, my belief, if we stood strong on the no's all the way through,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2371.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: then it comes to the position where we have to do the right thing for everybody or nobody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2375.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So right now, this is why the city is so divided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2378.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why morale, someone told me the other day when I mentioned it after I've talked to many different department heads, believe it or not, that morale here is terrible, and I can see why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2387.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So all I can say is this, what my fellow councilors saying, they're not wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2393.47s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2394.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is our power.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2396.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you, the power that we have today to vote yes and no for the contract, for the budget, just like we did last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2405.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just like we did last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2407.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we thought we won last year, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2409.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We thought we finally got what we needed to make this body work better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2413.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2415.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not one promise was fulfilled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2416.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2419.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No different than what you're going through so this is going to be a very interesting evening tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2423.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the community will see where we stand as a, as a council, where we stand and where we want the city to go, because if it's, if it's going to be, you know, pick and choose, like, it's being done on the city side with non union and dividing us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2439.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we're gonna see that here, then we're in a bad state for the next few years here, if that's gonna be the case, that stays the trend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2446.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I apologize and I told you that, and I appreciate you for coming up, I really do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2452.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know what, they have to see the people that it hurts, because I don't think people see, that's the other piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2458.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have a newspaper, people don't see it every day, what they see is fluff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2463.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A lot of people like to see the fluff and the happiness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2465.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What they don't like to see is what's happening right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2468.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You standing up there and saying there are people, there are ladies, women behind you that work hard for the city that are hurting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2474.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I just want you to know, I know the president has given us more than enough time to talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2481.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2482.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But there's nothing else we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2483.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2484.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2486.571s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3308.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3310.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3311.794s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Chris, again, I want to take the time to I know we expressed it as a council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3316.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to thank the Football Association and the high school football team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3319.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But whenever you think you guys are done, what I saw, what I saw and what I heard with the Kiwanians and feeding the, helping with the food insecurities and working together with Chelsea and making sure that again, Medford stood above it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3336.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I want to applaud the members of your team and the coach and staff for really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3344.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: really looking at what being a high school athlete is truly all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3347.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not, you know, if we looked at the wins and losses, that's, that's pretty small way of looking at this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3354.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the way that this football team, our football team brings so much pride to this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3360.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And for me personally, um, I just have to applaud the association coach Curly and his staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3366.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And most importantly, the kids in that team, cause they, they really, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3372.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: really standing above and showing what true superstars they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3376.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, thank you very much for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3581.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3583.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Some tragic news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3586.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, when Chris brings up<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3588.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: people that have given to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3590.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a gentleman who kids grew up in Medford, coached his youngest son, watched Freddy Rita give back to the kids in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3606.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when people weren't supposed to give to this much time and effort for certain type of kids,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3615.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Freddie would go and find the kids that couldn't afford a pair of cleats, or a pair of shin guards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3621.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he would make sure that he would buy those cleats and buy those shin guards, and then he'd put them on a team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3627.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then when at the time there was, you know, this infighting with method you soccer, and some people thought that kids in need really weren't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3636.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: getting the attention they deserve, Freddie and some others, dedicated members of the community, decided to start a new league called Method United.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3645.963s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they did that, not because of ego, but to make sure every kid was represented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3652.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it worked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3654.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what happened after a few years, that group then became, came together again as a true Method youth soccer organization that we see today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3663.613s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A true vision of what the demographic of what Method truly looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3672.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The canvas that is Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3674.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And Freddie's love for the game of soccer and Freddie's passion to help kids was evident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3683.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Freddie's a great story because I saw him a few weeks ago at a baseball game and we were talking and I didn't realize Freddie was an orphan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3693.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, there's no way that an orphan has the ability to raise such an amazing family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3699.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what he did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3700.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He raised amazing children and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3704.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: His wife, Adele, is just one of the best people that I've ever met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3708.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And unfortunately, Freddy lost his life mowing his lawn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3715.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's something that I know my family, myself, we're gonna miss Freddy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3721.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was very special.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3723.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we send our condolences to his family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3725.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was one of the great ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3727.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4378.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4379.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4380.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4381.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, Daniel, thank you for being a tight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4383.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How was the participation with the, uh, in these meetings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4387.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do we have a lot of community input?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4389.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, is that something that's that was that that was different?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4394.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, it was not as normal as usual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4423.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So not a big turnout of negatives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7208.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I just have some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7210.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7210.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know we can answer these questions, Miss Desmond, but I think that the points that were brought up that I want to bring forth as we move on, I think that we're, I think,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7226.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: any community that has a reputable establishment like raising canes to come into community I think it's a plus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7234.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I also think that the most important pieces is understanding what the neighbors that really about that location, and how that affects them and I think that that's why these are the questions that I have right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7247.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, I've gone back and forth with different neighbors, and they've called me back and forth, and the talk of using Dunkin' Donuts as an example, being open, having the drive-through, and so on and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7259.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that what's different with this is when they bought their homes, it was always an establishment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7264.695s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was Mr. Donut, Dunkin' Donuts, there was something always there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7267.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is an establishment that's coming in with established families and homes that are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7271.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just want to just express what neighbors have called me about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7277.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One being, you know, the issues are going to have a noise, adding patrons at one in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7284.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: usually they're not the quietest people in the world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7286.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, you know, you look at other takeout locations, you look at, for instance, Wendy's or Burger King, really don't about a neighborhood in that sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7297.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but we've also had issues with noise in those locations, but now coming into a neighborhood and understanding that and presenting that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7306.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The other piece is the actual air conditioning units and the nerve,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7314.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's been mentioned before being on the on the subcommittee and chairperson for lighting and signs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7318.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7340.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a very tough time and making sure we abide by these certain issues and blinking lights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7345.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's great that we did these traffic mediations and all this stuff, but all you did now is we've added more lights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7352.34s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've added more lights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7354.362s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So understanding how that is going to work with the neighbors and the people that have maybe a bedroom that abuts it maybe even 100 feet away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7364.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7365.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7367.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know the traffic issues, the way the design shows I, I don't, I don't see a real issue with that with the flow that it shows really directed people away so I think that that isn't a big issue I don't I don't think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7381.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But then I don't know if people have told you in that area we have a huge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7385.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: huge rodent issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7386.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now they're nervous that holy cow, we've had this rodent issue in this community and no one's responded to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7393.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one has come back to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7395.671s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they looked at different, they looked at stop and shop and different, you know, facilities that have food.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7401.035s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now you're bringing that 100 feet, 100 yards away from their home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7404.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: an eating establishment so now the nerves are heightened, and I just wanted to bring that up as, as we proceed through this process that these are really the contacts of information I got from from residents in that area so, and I know you know, I'm sure you agree with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7420.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are very sensitive topics and they're very valuable but it's something as we move forward that I wanted to make sure I made after your presentation I brought that up because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7430.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the residents that reached out to me, I told him, listen and watch the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7435.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why I asked previously to Danielle, if there was really public participation, her comments were well, here's today's public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7443.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that tells me we really didn't do much to really even though there were a couple of signs and we hit some of butters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7450.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The neighbors that I've talked to said they really weren't informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7453.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, that's neither here nor there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7455.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not your fault or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7456.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the city clerk this other reasons, but I just wanted to share that with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7513.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so I know that we've gone through this before with other facilities and other establishments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7521.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not, it's really aesthetic, it's not really set to hinder the decimal system, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7528.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Decimal level, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7542.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7543.792s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we've had some studies in the past that have shown that if it's not made as a deterrent where the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7557.159s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the make of it isn't made to hinder the noise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7561.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It really, whether it's going up or down, this is, again, this is something new from the neighbors that live across the street on the other side, having, they don't know that until it's done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7571.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's why it's coming up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7573.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is there a way that something that's aesthetic that can also be, you know, protected by, you know, with the noise level that they could do both?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7583.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7586.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that something we can look at?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7587.64s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know that this is these are things that the neighbors have asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10060.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council night, but the restriction with the trash pickup.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12249.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's point of information question would be to my fellow councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12252.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At the beginning of that you said the leadership, how and when was this leadership taken, and we're all of this council privy to that discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12265.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so the President and the Vice President met with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12270.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you saying you had you met with the mayor and you had the agenda that you and the president had to present to the mayor without the input of fellow councils, five other fellow councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12281.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that true?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12289.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12292.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did this leadership team meet with this council person and say, we're going to the mayor as our leadership team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12299.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did our leadership team come to this councilor that represents the people of the city and say, we have a plan that we want to present to the mayor as a councilor, do you agree?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12309.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you give me that opportunity?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12312.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12313.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12314.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that this agreement you have is fraudulent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12318.764s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It doesn't, it does not encompass what this, you can't put, you can't say, Madam President, that the leadership of this council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12328.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: eliminating some Councilors in that decision and say that this isn't a fraudulent decision that you've made?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12339.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it smells, if it walks like a duck, and it looks like a duck, it's a duck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12347.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I call into question for what you just said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12350.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12351.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information, the Councilor came into this chamber, looked at me and said to me and my fellow Councilor and said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12359.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talk with the mayor and we have an agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12363.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who is weak?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12364.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I'm not weak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12368.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I'm not weak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12369.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this council to say that my leadership with YouTube, and you represent me one Councilor, I don't care about anybody else right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12376.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You represent this council, you never you to never talk told me about this presentation, you were going to give the mayor and what what negotiations you were going to have with the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12387.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you're telling me the mayor met with YouTube, and you had an agreement that you think that you were going to work out to give her the votes that she needs to pass this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12413.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So on the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12414.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And because of open meeting, we're not allowed to have a conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12417.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Excuse me, excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12419.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He has the floor originally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12437.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, did the leadership talk to counter Caraviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12442.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a question I have, did the leadership talk to Councilor Knight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12445.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did the leadership talk to Councilor Collins?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12449.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did the leadership talk to Councilor Tseng?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12451.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And did the leadership talk to Councilor Scarpelli?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12454.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did the leadership do those things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12455.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if you did,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12457.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and without consulting maybe two or three or four and not all seven, then I'm going to have a problem with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12463.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm going to make sure that we look into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12465.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if you did that, if you individually talk to each Councilor and presented a plan that went to the mayor to negotiate something without all of us together, I find it to be a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12485.316s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Villes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12486.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You said leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12487.717s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What are you asking about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12489.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just asked you the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12490.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you talk to Councilor- Did I violate the open meeting law?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12493.698s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, no, did you meet, I never said that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12495.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said, I didn't say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12497.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said, I said, did you individually, I didn't say violate an open meeting law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12502.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you individually meet with other councilors to present a plan that you were gonna bring to the mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12509.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Be careful now, because there are ways to find things out now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12512.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the question I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12516.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you meet with other members of this council one on one didn't not saying you violate any open meeting law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12523.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you meet with other Councilors and present the plan that then went to the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12530.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12531.907s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you talk to Councilman Caraviello?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12534.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you count Scott's concept?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12547.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because why do you have a meeting with us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12548.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why did you put this up in a meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12550.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These discussions occurred between other meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12553.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, it doesn't look good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12556.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It doesn't make it that this council, all due respect, this council's worked hard to work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12561.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this council has been standing side by side with all of these negative initiatives that we will follow through, we'll continue with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12569.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because there's a lot that's gonna be said tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12571.821s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to go through that and then make a decision after talking to only three Councilors or two Councilors and then going to the mayor personally and negotiating something for what's best, the leadership for what's best for us in this city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12585.331s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You didn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12587.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nobody consulted me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12587.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: From what I gather, nobody consulted Councilor Caraviello or Councilor Knight or Councilor Collins, as you said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12595.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I find that a real problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12598.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12599.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12628.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then I moved to table this meeting for another next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12632.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13335.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not done yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13336.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not done yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13338.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if you're interested in... It's a question because I'm sure this point of information is simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13343.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The question is this, does this body, the city council, are we not supposed to do what this council just said yes or no, what you just said, are we not supposed to be including what you just said, I'm bringing it to you as the first opportunity to you what I'm saying is, our duties as city Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13367.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: supposed to be given the respect of what you negotiated with as a normal process as a city councilor and that's what we want but you didn't do that that's exactly what we get we're gonna get that next budget we we get it anyway we don't by law we get it anyway obviously councilor collins was next to be recognized<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13781.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That'd be nice if she was that was a question I was going to jump in if I can matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13784.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13786.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can you tell us who's on the call as department heads?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13804.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The superintendent isn't on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14235.779s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is, this council is gonna vote on a budget today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14239.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we talked about, there was some changes that were made that really made you think of, this is what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14245.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I asked my fellow councilors to listen to what we just heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14250.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna take $500,000, $600,000 of ESSER money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14254.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna settle the budget on an election year to make everybody happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14259.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then next year, the teachers that you talk about, the kids that you talk about that you love,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14265.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna be in such dire disrepair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14268.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know how we're gonna dig out of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14271.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what's frightening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14273.065s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Understand what we're doing right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14275.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Caraviello presented the numbers that came out of the budget book.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14278.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate the numbers you shared with me, because these are outstanding numbers that when we talk about funding for this community, of funding for a budget, of funding for a prop two and a half, of funding for these different projects, understand this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14295.148s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Planning and development $703,000 budgeted 226,000 was used 32% was the budget was spent 32% we spent police 14.3, we spent 7.4 51% of the budget wasn't spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14315.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: DPW 12.9 spent 6.7, 52% of the budget wasn't spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14323.088s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Fire department, excuse me, after DPW, these are the big five right now that we're bringing up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14328.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the total expenditure is we're looking at, we're talking millions of dollars that have been mismanaged that we could have used<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14340.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we could have used to fix these gaps in the library, to fix the gaps in the school department, to fix the gaps on the streets and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14349.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Instead, this council voted for bonds, 2.5 million, 2 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14355.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We voted for bonds to do the work that was already in the budget, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14359.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are your numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14360.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are the numbers that came from this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14364.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To see that we over-budgeted this much money is a gross, a gross mishandling of our city's funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14373.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not yours, not mine, this community's funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14378.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is appalling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14380.148s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about millions and millions of dollars that we didn't use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14384.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So listen, I'm looking at apples to apples before we got this information, before we got to finally sit down, because when you get the budget book on the Friday or Father's Day weekend, it's really tough to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14396.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when we get to this point and we talk about what are we doing, in most communities, as you brought up, Madam Chief of Staff,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14405.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In most communities, like tomorrow night, I'll be sitting in Somerville, it's called Cut Night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14410.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Every department head will be here to support any questions at the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14413.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the respect they get.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14416.437s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The biggest budget line we have is education, and our superintendent isn't even here to answer a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14423.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I had other questions that was brought to my attention after looking at the capital plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14428.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For instance, the neglected fields behind Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14433.035s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that have been out past this day over five years, that if we end up doing a study, which happens every year, it should, and it shows that that field is unsafe, we have to close two of the most important fields down the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14446.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't see anything, which is a huge revenue generator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14450.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what I was going to ask the superintendent tonight, but she's not here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14455.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are serious issues that we don't have any department head in front of us that we can ask these questions, because I would love to talk to the department heads, because I'm gonna be honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14466.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've talked to some department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14468.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've talked to people that are in the know, because believe it or not, there are still relationships here, and they're petrified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14475.427s">[Scarpelli]</a>: George, don't ever speak my name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14477.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want you to understand that the confusion they have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14483.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with the way we run a budget, they're very confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14486.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because when they do their lines, and they then match up what's presented to them, they're totally confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14493.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I bet you what, if I do a Freedom of Information Act, and I ask for any communications between department heads to a director of finance, we're gonna see some questions that department heads are very confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14508.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we talk about this budget, when we've been talking about this budget as a union, we've been talking about what the mismanagement has been with this council for months, if not a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14519.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For what we've been promised, what we weren't, remember that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14522.613s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Remember, I'm gonna not say the council's name, but remember, I will never let that happen to me again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14529.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor lied to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14530.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will never let it happen to me again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14534.005s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She promises everything last year at one o'clock in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14536.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We get nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14537.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Here we are today to consider that you're going to vote for this budget with these questions befuddling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14548.168s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these are serious issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14550.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are issues that this councilor, I'm going to reach out and find out on what avenues we can take to do a deep dive in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14558.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we do an audit, but this is something that frightens me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14562.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if Councilor Caraviello said it's a pattern, this is one year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14565.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it's a pattern for three years, what are we doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14568.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a gross mismanagement of our city funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14572.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a gross mismanagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14574.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14576.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Take a deep breath, go sit down with your budget book, because when I asked this question, if this was real or not, it's in your numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14584.824s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's in your book.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14587.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are not just a couple of percent, because I've asked a couple of finance directors in neighboring communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14592.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Rarely you look at an overage about two and a half to three and a half percent, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14595.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what they look at, usually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14597.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the gap that other communities they say that they put into, about two and a half to three and a half percent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14605.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 32, 51, 52, 57, 59, that's only five departments that we over budgeted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14613.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if this council wants to vote for this budget, when you hear these facts and say, this is better for our community, think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14622.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Think about it, no matter what was said or what was negotiated, think about what the numbers in front of you say before you vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14628.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I tell you, if you support this with this information in front of you,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14634.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope everybody's watching, because remember, you vote, and you represent every member of this community, and you're their fiscal watchdog.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14644.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why I appreciate your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14646.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we talked and you gave me this, I couldn't believe it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14648.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I went back and I looked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14649.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not a really numbers guy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14652.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I went and sat with a few people that I can talk to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14656.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they couldn't believe it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14667.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If this is gonna be, if tonight's gonna be a gotcha game or you win or we win, we all lose if this budget passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14672.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all I have to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14673.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14676.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just if they have a response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15199.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can, so we have other questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15230.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The question was that we have something public that the mayor is agreed with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15235.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did she not publicly give us other issues last year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15239.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do we not have other public issues last year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15240.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is this what you're going to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15319.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, that is true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15321.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you point of information point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15326.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, with this information you just gave us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15329.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You just openly told us that the numbers we have aren't true, how can we go to this budget should we vote on this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15403.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is Councilor Tseng-Wook done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15448.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry very, very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15452.407s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I find it that it's in doubt that we have a software that the finance director has concerns with and would presented a budget that I find that it's on a slippery slope right now to make a decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15465.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I also think that my fellow councils are making a decision because publicly things were promised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15473.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As if we weren't remember when we were promised the city solicitor, we didn't get one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15478.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: last year when we were given a city solicitor, and we were given the other options that we sat here for and waited for and we got, we never came through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15485.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want you to forget that I want to make sure it's on the public record that I said that, because the reason why my fellow council said they were in favor of this budget because whatever was whatever was discussed and agreed on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15500.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's discussed in open, and it's been, it's public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15504.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15506.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what we've never been lied to before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15511.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, the reason why I say this, and I know, listen, we still have questions that still haven't been answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15521.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I asked for a copy of the consultant<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15526.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: who put the safety of our kids in the high school on the forefront of his report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15533.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've yet to see that report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15535.768s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All we know- The Welsh report?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15537.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, it hasn't been discussed in the budget that even though we haven't, the $900,000 was asked because of the report coming from the school committee, the $900,000 was asked in that report<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15552.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to make Medford High School safe and efficient moving forward, like the addition of principals, like the addition of more paraprofessionals, like the addition of monitors, like the addition of security systems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15568.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now we're gonna vote on something without taking that consultant and not honor what they've said and agree that we'll let ESSER funding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15581.076s">[Scarpelli]</a>: fix the deficit that we all so strongly were negatively against because of this factor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15587.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because all we're doing is pushing this down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15590.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And openly, Madam Mayor, Madam President, this looks like, as long as it gets through this budget season, because November is a very important season, that let's not worry about that now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15601.509s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's just get through the season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15602.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's get through the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15606.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what I see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15607.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just wanted to share that with my fellow Councilors, and I would yield now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15623.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, but the report, we want to see the report, because what I will tell you- I didn't get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15627.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, but what I will tell you too is when I talked to the teachers that were actually interviewed, they were so impressed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15635.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: by the consultant and they had they they finally felt like they were listened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15640.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But after the meeting that I missed on Wednesday, unfortunately, what I found out from some of these teachers that who, by the way, who are now gone, teachers that have been in the system for years who left, they've had enough, they moved on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15651.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's speaking freely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15653.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when they tell me that come September, if these things aren't in place, we're going to be in the same situation of fear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15664.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and safety concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15666.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what they've shared with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15667.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just wanna share that with you because I haven't seen anything about increase in principals and assistant principals, and we're talking about whatever, and if it is done the way it's funded right now, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15680.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam Chief of Staff, the way it's funded, we're looking at $600,000 right off the top next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15686.177s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So whatever we're gonna implement, it might be good for a year, but then it's all gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15691.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I just don't think that's a sound<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15695.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: fiscal responsible decision we can make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15697.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just don't think so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15699.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15702.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, if you can, I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1313.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, I thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1315.096s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we've been getting messages back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1317.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is the reason why I asked for the extension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1321.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate you working with the neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1323.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, we know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1324.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know the neighbors are very happy with the the rules that you're putting in place your employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1330.169s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1331.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But so let's just so we can move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1333.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you're asking for the extended hours until 12 o'clock just for Fridays and Saturdays and Wednesday night and Wednesday night special<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1348.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is exactly what I was hoping for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1350.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we're looking at the conversation we had back and forth with both everybody talking in favor for you and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1359.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the respect that you have for the neighbors, the neighbors they have for you, my friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1363.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would, I know we still have to move forward, but so to be clear, it's Wednesday, Fridays, and Saturdays until 12 o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1371.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1371.98s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're welcome, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1375.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, what the question was, if it was going to be, you know, if we were gonna deny it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1382.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, in what grounds do we have to deny the special permit?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1386.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that with this resolution, I know we'll hear from the residents, but if we don't see any conflicts, I appreciate the council for being here, but we wouldn't need their involvement because that answer would be new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1401.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1414.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1513.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: D'Antonio, if I can, I know I asked for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1517.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for this meeting specifically because I didn't think that this was just the issue with just with oasis I think the enforcement was big so I recommended that we had legal counsel here, the police chief, the DPW traffic commission, I mean the traffic director as anybody else here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1539.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We should, I think we asked for the parking director also.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1541.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the parking director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1545.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I do not see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1546.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not the building, but really is really having.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1579.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, well, I'm a little disappointed because we asked him to come tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1581.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that was one of the reasons wasn't just, it wasn't just the community members and the business owners to talk and glad you did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1589.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the other reason why we call this because it was concerns of other issues that I think the enforcement was bringing in the negativity of the business owners<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1598.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: where we have to make sure that there's a plan in place, whether it's signage, whether we talk to the traffic commission, and do residents only from certain times or set up, you know, patrols in the parking lot area, and around the same time is the closing of the establishment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1616.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is the these are the questions I wanted to ask<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1619.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the the departments that are relevant to get us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1623.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1638.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so I think that'll be something we'll have to follow through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1640.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think for the neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1642.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the feedback that I got back from the neighbors was that, you know, really, is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1648.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is giving South Method the respect that they deserve and the residents there that they deserve, and making sure that there's some sort of a plan that the administration can work with the traffic department, the chief of police, and making sure that they step up dedicated patrols if that's what's needed in the evenings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1665.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think the piece that bothered me the most, the phone calls that I got, were the elderly neighbors that said that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1673.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the blocking of the driveways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1675.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to say that it was Oasis's fault, I didn't believe that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1681.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that the issue really is having the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1688.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1689.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that we need to, you know, I know it's not a popular thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1693.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when you throw a few tickets on a few cars, and somebody gets told because a senior citizen can't back up out of the driveway for an emergency reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1701.842s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's more important to me than any anybody's uncomfortable situation of going to get their their automobile out of impound because they didn't park and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1711.666s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a reasonable area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1712.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's something down the line we need to really call for a meeting, whether it be a committee of the whole or subcommittee on public safety, and really bring the neighbors back out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1722.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1818.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's part of the discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1821.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The part of the discussion with the owners, we're going to place signs not only in the facility, but also as they walk around toward the public parking area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1829.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe it's going to be in a few different languages, just for our Portuguese speaking patrons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1836.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1837.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's the, you know, and I appreciate that the general came up and talked about, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1857.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe community development?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1858.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1859.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1859.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1860.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To reach out to Bocelli's and I think Mace Cafe stays open a little later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1865.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So maybe reaching out to them, form a motion that maybe that the liaison to the businesses can reach out and see what they can do to make sure that they can post some signage or, you know, for their patrons to also respect that neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1881.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Could you please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1882.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2063.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not extended, correct, because that goes with the owner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2065.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So all this is just changing of ownership from one subway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2070.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2070.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2070.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The subway and Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2072.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2072.719s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2072.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is that you have only five employees that work for you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2097.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, I see everything in order, all paperwork's in order, so I would move approval after my colleagues have any comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2244.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2245.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This came about when the resident came to us who's been on the list, who lives in a private way who who's lived there for a long time in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2257.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: she planted a tree, a rooting tree in front of her establishment, her home, and she sat on the list for three years and was informed by a city engineer, I believe, and I was hoping he was here, but obviously he's not, that the city engineer has now followed through with the hard line, which is a law that the city does not maintain private ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2282.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will tell you I received many phone calls concerning public safety when it comes to these decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2290.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can understand when it comes to doing these bigger projects and understand our rules and regulations when it comes to private ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2297.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We understand that one of the biggest reasons that we don't receive enough funding from the state or the federal government is because Medford has, what people don't realize, an abundance of private ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2311.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it really hurts our bottom line when it comes to road work in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2316.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if you talk to most people that own homes on private ways, they have a lot of pride and they maintain their homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2324.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this one person who has a very dangerous lip now because of a rooting tree and has been on this list, had now been told that this would not work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2335.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we need to clarify this because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2339.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The truth of the matter is, if someone does still trip and fall, the burden falls back on who?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2345.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not the resident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2347.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It comes back to this council and the city and legal action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2351.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if you see those suits that we've had in the past, 3,500, 5,500, these all add up to a pretty good number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2356.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But more importantly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2364.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I fear that it's going to be that elderly person that walks down that private way, smashes their head and God forbid passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2373.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think this is something that to just be passive about changing this rule as a new new city engineer, and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2383.191s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I wish he was here because I'd like to ask him some questions that the residents that did reach out to him from what I've been told was that it was very arrogant in his presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2394.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to me as a city employee, municipal employee, that person works for the residents of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2400.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's the biggest piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2402.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we need to have guidelines set by this administration, really informing the people in the private ways of these rule changes or not to rule changes, but the the the persistence of following those rules now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2418.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, I got a phone call from another resident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2421.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he said, Well, George, we live over here near Arthur Winthrop Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2426.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My neighbors and I, three years ago, followed the rule and we brought in a hot top company because the street was deplorable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2434.764s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they talked to these professionals and said, because this isn't a major way, you should use this type of top, this type of patch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2443.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They repaved the whole street on their dime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2446.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They did it right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2448.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then they're upset now because during the Winthrop Street project,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2454.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The city diverted all of the traffic where?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2459.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Through this private way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2462.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, because of the hot top that was laid, because of the trucks that drove down that road consistently, their street is now in disarray.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2473.316s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So their question that I wanted to ask the city engineer, if this is the case, what fair is fair, is the city now liable for repaving that street?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2485.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's a logical point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2489.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, when you're not talking, you're not communicating with your residents, this is a huge concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2496.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these are the things that are open-ended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2498.636s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I would make the motion that we ask the city administration to please set up guidelines to re-educate our constituents on the follow through now of our new engineer and the policies that they're now following through or not following through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2515.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and the fact that what if the city is diverting the public traffic into their private ways and destroying these roadways that have just been paved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2529.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I like to get these answered for these constituents because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2535.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The next step is they said they would come here and the eight people that I did talk to said, you could use my name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2540.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, you know what, let's see what the answers are in the follow through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2545.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I will tell you, for the residents that are listening,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2548.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is very frustrating for us because we ask these questions, not because we want to be rabble rousers because that's because this city administration has come up here and said, well, our, our, our directors, our directors in different departments are actually afraid to come to city council because of backlash or aggressive behavior.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2567.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is what we're putting office we're putting office to be their voice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2573.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's not an easy place to stand, but when you were elected or you're hired in a municipal field, that's part of your job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2581.763s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's your, that's part of your job requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2583.544s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Come here and answer these questions so residents can understand what the process is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2626.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we need more communication through the administration to really let our constituents know of these processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2636.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When no one comes up to answer these questions, everything's left open-ended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2640.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the frustration gets to a boiling point where we're seeing good people in this community putting for sale signs and moving out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2647.922s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that I hate to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2650.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And all it is sometimes is just simple conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2653.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You saw what we did tonight with a very, very, very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2658.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: productive business in our city and neighbors that had an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2661.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They got to sit down together because we opened the line of communication for them and they found the best avenue for both parties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2668.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these are the things we need in our community and I think the city administration is really failing us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2674.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3174.747s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, I think that the goal for this is really to educate the constituents, and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3184.842s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so I would like to see a community hall with those residents of private ways, get the word out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3190.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate Councilor Knight and Councilor Bears sending that information, but when you are living to a certain standard here, and you've grown up in a private way or lived in a private way, and all of a sudden snap a finger, the way that you've lived your life, things have changed now, whether it's right, wrong or indifferent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3216.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The residents that live in those private ways have to be reeducated and really have to acknowledge what needs to be expected as they move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3231.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If this is the way it goes, like Councilor Knight said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3235.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the I don't blame the city engineer in any way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3238.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I question his his behavior or his tone with what residents have told me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3244.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you know, I'd like I said, if he was here, I'd love to ask him but but that's the what I question with our our city engineer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3252.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, my question is really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3254.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you're making changes, sweeping changes that are really affecting our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3259.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And especially when it comes to public safety, when people are expecting their sidewalks to get done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3266.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because imagine if, like Councilor Knight said, you have a sidewalk that's panels lifted, you have an elderly parent that lives in your home with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3276.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're expecting the city to make these changes because they've been on this list, so they wait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3282.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now all of a sudden they're told that after three years you're top of that list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3285.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They know we're not fixing it because you're a private way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3288.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're changing our policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3290.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3292.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we need to meet with all of these departments and really set the tone with how to reeducate our private way residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3301.02s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then maybe they have to answer some questions about legitimate questions that were brought about on detours and sending heavy trucking that ruined a street that has just been paved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3313.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these are legitimate issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3316.169s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=129.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3315.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3315.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First of all, what I'm hearing is, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3321.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: from consensus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3322.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, there's a lot of people that say that our friends at Oasis are hardworking people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3327.705s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I do hear is that there is quality of life issues that deal with someone in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3335.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I find it hard to believe that it's all Oasis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3337.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I find it very difficult to believe that we can say this is all Oasis's fault.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3342.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think again, I think that this is the Antonio brings the point that's very important here is the enforcement I had multiple neighbors call me this week about this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3355.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it didn't just start it started with Oasis but then it continued on about the lack of enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3362.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in the streets of South Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3365.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what I see that are issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3368.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I do think that there are compromises.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3373.69s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As I did my study, I looked at the restaurants and the different bars that are open in the area, and there aren't too many that are open that are budding neighborhoods like Razo's or Bocelli's that are open till one o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3394.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's something we have to wait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3397.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I think where we're talking about many people have come up and said that legally we have to really what my recommendation tonight so we table this until we have a committee the whole meeting then maybe we can what that happens we can ask legal representation to me with the council to give us some direction and what we can and what we can't do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3421.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll give you some examples we.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3425.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't approve a gas station from BJ's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3430.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we gave the wrong reasons why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3432.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then what happened was BJ's came back because we didn't have legal representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3436.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They sued us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3438.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They won.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3440.362s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had to go back to court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3441.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now guess who's suing us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3443.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3445.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The residents are suing us because we're stuck in the middle because we don't have legal representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3449.51s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't had a city solicitor in a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3452.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're not lawyers, we're elected officials that are trying to do best for our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3458.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that we've got a report from our building department that our code enforcement officers are doing the best they can, unfortunately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3471.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the size of the city that we are now and what's going on in the city, only having a few enforcement officers, it's very difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3479.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3481.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Parking, we know that's a huge issue, huge concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3485.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have family members that live on Princeton Street that call me all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3488.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They think because I'm on the city council, I must own a tow truck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3492.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I understand completely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3495.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, this is a parking lot that is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3501.272s">[Scarpelli]</a>: open to the community, and there are no limitations other than making sure commercial vehicles aren't parked in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3509.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I, you know, is there something that the residents can talk with the owners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3515.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we table this and come back and say well, maybe there's something that you're looking at, maybe Friday, Saturday and Sunday till 12 o'clock if there are church groups that are coming in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3524.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe there's some kind of compromise that, you know, we'll can all work together to see what we can do what's best both for the business owner, and for the residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3533.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, I've worked directly with a few people that are sitting in this auditorium about Oasis and their lack of cleanliness and they don't put the barrels out and the trash truck comes at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3545.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to be honest with you, they've done a great job since we met with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3552.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I haven't heard the same complaints from different people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3557.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's maybe one or two of the same people that are complaining.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3561.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and maybe they have a right to, but the truth of the matter is they're doing the best they can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3565.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, the alternative is imagine if they're not there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3570.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're seeing empty storefronts everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3574.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's what we're concerned about as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3577.16s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So trying to find that compromise, I think might be the way to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3581.02s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I'm not saying we should or we shouldn't because legally we don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3586.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my recommendation truly is going to be to table this until we have a committee of the whole meeting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3592.427s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with city administration, with all the parties involved, our code enforcement team, our representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3609.436s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My motion, table this until we have a better understanding legally of where we can go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3616.839s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We all have our thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3618.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We all have our thoughts if Oasis was maybe a couple blocks away where it didn't, but a home, homes, they would say no, they're thriving, we don't want Oasis to leave, we need to have them, give them anything they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3632.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, but then you have residents that are saying, listen, I mean, we had issues with, first it was, I remember the first phone call I got was the trucks are revving their engine in front of a window, keeping their engines running while they're running in to get something to eat in front of a resident's baby's bedroom window.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3650.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we stopped that completely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3651.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We ended up moving with the city and Oasis, we ended up bringing in planters, gigantic planters, so they couldn't park up on the curb.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3659.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's just discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3662.293s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe it's just a discussion we can have again, and see what we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3666.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I you know, and I'll do respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3669.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You don't have control of your clientele, but you do have control of your people that work for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3674.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if you guys if we can all sit together and try to find a way that we can fix that, and help the neighbors and be part of the neighborhood community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3682.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if it's something that we're bringing in the traffic enforcement saying, well, we need resident parking only.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3688.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the nights that we're going to that we would allow Oasis to have a certain extended hours of operations that we make sure that there those parking spaces are open for residents at 10 o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3699.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's got to be something that we can work with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3701.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I'm only saying this as a way<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3705.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to a final answer that can help everybody here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3708.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I that's why Madam President, if I can, I'll make the motion that I feel we need to table this and move this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3716.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have all the representation at the table, including a legal representation that can guide us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3721.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I hate to do it, by the way, I voted, I voted against everything that had to do with a representative for from KP law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3730.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we're paying them hundreds and hundreds of dollars just by picking up the phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3735.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hate that we have to ask them, but because we don't have a city attorney in the city for a year, I think with this situation, I think it's warranted because either way, I don't wanna make a decision either favoring or being against without knowing the true ramifications legally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3750.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I hope you can understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3752.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's why I make the motion that we table to a committee of the whole<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3756.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that, you know, we can even make it within the next 10 days if we can, that we asked the city to the mayor to have legal representation, be present to answer our questions and hopefully we can make a reasonable decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3770.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And maybe in that time, maybe the respected owners of Oasis who I feel that every time I've talked to them, they've been very, very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3778.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've been very, very welcoming and understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3781.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we have people that are definitely committed in our South Medford community, that maybe there could be some kind of discussion that we can say, hey, let's find, let's find a common ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3790.69s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then let's, let's revisit this when we can a community of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4893.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the respect Councilor Bears, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4898.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I just want to, I think that one of the biggest pieces, I appreciate the owner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4903.651s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's a great compromise, but I also think that there are,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4908.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: bigger issues here that that the city needs to address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4912.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, the traffic, the traffic issues, the, we have our special services department, they're all here and I know they work probably at hours a week, but they've been sitting here for the last three hours and having them understand the process<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4932.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and what their relationship with Oasis, so we know how you've been in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4938.913s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think they're, you know, this isn't beating a dead horse at all in my eyes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4942.016s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is trying to get the best case forward for something that, again, I, as one Councilor, don't feel comfortable making until we have legal support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4956.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like, so again, I, you know, I would, I would still like to go to date certain for our next open meeting to extend it there that we can ask a representative legal representative, I think the owners of Oasis and here's the thing on the people that are against it and the people that are for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4978.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we don't find a compromise, someone's gonna lose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4981.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that we need to maybe find some, some common ground that maybe in two weeks we come back keep this extended for two weeks, and then put it first in the agenda, ask those questions and then vote on it, because I, you know, I, I feel that I can't speak for anybody, but I feel that the majority of the council is in favor of it, but I also think that this is an opportunity for us to meet with the administration,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5005.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: bring in the MPD, bring in the traffic, talk to Inspection Services, ask DPW about the upkeep and what's going on there and about signage for the parking lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5016.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and permits for maybe the drivers that can park there until 12, and then close it and resident only that could park in there then tow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5024.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's other things we can use this meeting for to find the best avenue for the community and self-medical, including Oasis, because this isn't going away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5033.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we give them the permit three days, guess what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5037.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The self-med residents are gonna come back and say, Oasis is doing this again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5039.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5041.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5042.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But let's try to solve this instead of just pushing it through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5045.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's wait a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5046.364s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's bring everybody in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5047.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's let's have the parties work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5049.945s">[Scarpelli]</a>: See what's best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5050.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Come back to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5051.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's put something thoughtful on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5053.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have to talk about it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5055.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Listen, I'm sure you don't want some of the emails you get from some of the people that email you every single week about issues in South Meffin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5061.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We could sit everybody at a table to figure things out right now to get a better understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5067.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would welcome that, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5069.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it's voted down, it's voted down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5071.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But that would be my motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5073.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5084.582s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our next regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5198.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5199.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Ask the people, ask the people, the neighbors at BJ's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5203.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, but the good advice we got there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6014.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6015.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, moms demand action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6018.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I remember a little organization when I was young that started up by their moms was a program called SADD, and it virtually eliminated drunk driving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6027.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's something that, luckily, it's just second nature for our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6033.29s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They just, we don't see that anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6036.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as much as we used to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6037.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that, you know, being Councilor, being Councilor Tseng is one of his teachers, I remember going through those training sessions and bringing kids into the into the lockdown areas and going over this and watching how crazy it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6050.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then here we are today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6051.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, my daughter's 18.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6053.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's graduating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6054.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the whole process is second nature to her now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6057.541s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's sad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6058.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's sad that they have to live this life this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6060.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I appreciate when moms take take action like you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6064.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6065.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: do just a little piece that makes such a big impact, because studies have shown a lot of gun violence death, especially at the youth level, comes from kids taking their parents' guns and playing with them, and self-inflicted, or taking them to school and hurting others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6081.171s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, to reiterate what I said, thanks for bringing this forward, but keep the good fight going, and whatever we need, the council's behind you 1,000%, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6487.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6490.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6578.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can, can each of the members that are here, can you come to the podium?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6581.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you can, I know that we don't want to, if you, I think everybody should know who they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6587.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if you just give your name and the year that you are currently in right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6606.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm Matthew Harrison, I'm a junior.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6609.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Congratulations, and again, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6616.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The reason why I asked you to do this is twofold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6619.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we have our athletes, after they win a championship, we ask them to come up and we recognize them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6623.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we have our leaders in the theater, our arts, we ask them to come up and identify them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6629.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think it's important that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6631.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You started now a legacy and now it's a tradition that's going to carry on because I hear we're all into classman so we're all coming back next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6639.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have a dynasty at the vocational school so I will share something with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6646.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I will start it off by the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6648.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the trip to, I believe it's Colorado, we're in need of some funding, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6653.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think, so I'm not going to say how much, but I'm going to start, I'm going to ask the community if we could find a way to help, just reach out to the high school or or the clerk to see if we can reach out to anybody who'd like to donate to help with their cause.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6667.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm going to donate, I'll be the first one to donate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6670.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll talk to Mr. Campbell, one of the parents, to help out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6673.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that, you know, to get the ball rolling, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6677.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you deserve to be in Colorado to represent the city of Medford and our schools and such an honor for you to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6684.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6858.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I did, I know Mr. Puccio is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6862.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that, let him speak, but I think this is an amazing event, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6946.716s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6947.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First of all, Miss Butcher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6948.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6949.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, um, there's still a little undertone of disgruntled Italian Americans in the city method for reasons I won't bring forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6958.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But these are the events that bring everybody back and put everybody in the right frame of mind, and we really appreciate you taking the forefront and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6974.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's wonderful, you know, with this wonderful event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6979.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I move approval with the food truck and ask my colleagues to support as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6987.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7675.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: development is progressing method, but I'm just a little leery that this type of zone changing for individual parcels is what really affects our community in a negative way in the sense that, unfortunately, we don't have a true understanding of what a whole picture looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7697.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, when you look at neighboring communities and they said, we'll use, we'll use assembly row.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7702.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was a whole vision that wrapped around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7706.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I don't feel comfortable doing is approving his zoning change right now for one building right now, and not knowing what the rest of the picture looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7715.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was fortunate enough to start with Mayor Curtatone and working with him and seeing what he did when<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7721.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh geez, Ikea had the number one spot back in the day in assembly row, then all of a sudden the vision started changing and started conforming and they had to find a way to move Ikea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7732.177s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My whole, my reservation with this is really making these spot changes in zoning to accommodate certain groups without truly understanding, and I know we have a long process to go, but that's probably one of the most dangerous<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7749.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: intersections in the country, and the residents in the Wellington area that people seem to forget about, where you're gonna be bringing in, how many units is that right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7762.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7763.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now imagine adding that much without understanding the true impact with the whole community there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7771.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7771.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's where my reservation comes in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7773.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So believe me, I love the idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7776.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I see if there was a comprehensive plan to see what it all would look like together, and that's what I'm sure in your profession, you see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7784.407s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's why you're here right now because we have such an outdated zoning format that you have to come up and ask for this ridiculous format so I just have to be honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7795.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I love the idea it looks beautiful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7797.779s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just right now I.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7800.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, again, that the understanding of what the true impact means the rest of the growth there and what impact it brings to, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7811.353s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, the negative issues it brings to that Middlesex area, the Wilmington area, I couldn't support it unless, you know, we had our Office of Community Development and people sharing, I don't know if Alicia's on the line, just even understanding what the vision is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7829.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, again, that's, we call these, you know, what was the big thing back in the day is gateway communities, gateway entrances, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7836.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a gateway that's coming in from Everett Rivera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7839.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a very important piece right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8181.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8181.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hunt, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8183.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We appreciate all your hard work and we know you're super busy,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8186.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: moving forward, I would love a conversation to share that vision with us so we can all celebrate in what we're trying to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8196.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is what the biggest concern we're having with the administration is understanding that obviously the zoning isn't going as quickly as we want it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8206.233s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the representative to your words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8208.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it meant a lot to me, understanding more what you're saying as our leader in the office of community development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8215.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that maybe if you could moving forward is, you know, share those ideas with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8221.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it would go a long way to at least moving my decisions forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8226.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And because that's the issue is we do need housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8229.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The issue is we do need the development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8232.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need the new money in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8233.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's something we've always been,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8235.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: crying out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8236.18s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same time, I think understanding what the vision is, and understanding that we could be great partners in this, at least all of us, not just individual Councilors, but all of us to make sure that we're all celebrating in this and moving something like this forward, I think will be helpful in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8254.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8255.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would move, Madam President, that we move this to the next step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8324.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, for one Councilor, I'd rather you be a little premature and reach out to us for the fact that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8331.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've worked with other communities and seen what they're doing, and there's a partnership there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8336.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sure this was something that the city was working with, must be months now, because this doesn't pop up overnight, and you got it last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8345.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my hope is only that you share these visions with us so we can help move things forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8353.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think it's negative in any way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8355.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't try to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8356.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not trying to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8357.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if you can, just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8360.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, be a little premature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8361.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd rather you be a little premature because it would help us moving this forward a lot quicker and understanding it, at least a big picture and a better vision to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9885.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a former negotiating member of contract as a teacher and a active member of a negotiating team municipality, that is absolutely appalling what I just heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9900.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That just tells you, and it should be a shot across this community, of where we are in the leadership of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9908.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now it's sad because we're gonna get phone calls tomorrow saying, what are you doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9912.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't political.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9915.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I keep telling people we don't have a newspaper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9917.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have an avenue to share what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9920.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the only forum right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9923.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you were here earlier that six o'clock meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9926.692s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was it was our council's wish list go over the budget, our hopes and budget for the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9934.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I was so demoralized as I got went through that mental process to see what I needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9941.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9944.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's you're always overlooked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9946.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're saying that you're not getting paid, but I want to ask you a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9950.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have plenty of staff in your offices, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9952.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9953.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, you don't, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9955.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's abundance of employees that are DPW and your secretarial team way understaffed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9961.02s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you're not only are you not getting paid what you deserve, you're doing the job of two to three people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9967.364s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here's the funny, here's the funny piece cause I can see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9970.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9971.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We vote no on the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9974.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In 45 days, they have to pass it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9975.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They have to run on a different budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9977.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Guess who'll have to do all the work to get the new budget prepared?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9980.051s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The secretaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9983.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9983.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what's so moronic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9987.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's scary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9987.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I, for one, as a union member and part of a municipal team,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9995.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have not voted for any money paper, let alone increases for the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10002.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have they gone back to the administration, taken down salaries?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10006.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have they done that to the administration staff?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10008.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because they're okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10012.099s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, for the ones that are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10015.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just find this very, very frightening that people have to understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10020.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In a normal negotiation, you have a representative from the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10024.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And a lot of times when you're at a crossroads, then your mayor steps in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10029.928s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A lot of times when I sat in negotiation, you had city solicitor who would come in, the representative from HR or your HR director, department head, who's in administration, working with each individual unit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10044.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and you find that common balance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10046.526s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You look and negotiate for trading language for percentage, trading longevity for other options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10056.575s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is how you work it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10058.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What my frustration that I need to share with all of you is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10063.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We truly don't know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10066.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the financial outlook of our community in a few weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10069.494s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know where we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10070.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't seen any projections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10073.016s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't seen any pre-budget stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10075.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't seen anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10076.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All we hear are rumors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10078.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We hear that the school committee got probably one of the biggest budget pieces in the community, the biggest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10086.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We were told that they got a letter, the school committee got a letter saying that we're looking at huge cuts and layoffs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10093.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the teachers called me and says, well, is this why we got what we got for percentage so they can cut everybody?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10100.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what I fear, what we don't know, we don't know what the budget's gonna, I'm afraid of as bad as it is in city halls, bad as it is out in the streets and the roads and the parks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10115.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know where we are, but I will tell you,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10119.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in negotiations as a school team member, as in negotiations in a municipal department where I work as a city councilor, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10130.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Fagli, I understand exactly what you're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10133.761s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm willing to stand with you and say, hey,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10137.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's start off this budget meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10138.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's start this process off by saying, hey, if part of the budget process with the city council isn't making everybody whole and making sure everybody's on the path to make sure that they're supported and they're shown the respect they deserve, I'm willing to stand with you in any day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10158.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10159.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm willing to do that any day of the week with all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10165.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10168.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Where, what I'm, what I have, my disappointment, my fear is that we don't know where the climate, financial climate is in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10179.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know Councilor is saying, we would love to, I agree with you, let's use that 25 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10184.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we have a resolution out asking, where did this 25 million come from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10189.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one's told us yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10191.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10192.051s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the fact that they have KP Law and everything,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10197.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: issues at the school department, handling personnel issues, school department, handling negotiations here, fighting for taking away 40B projects and development in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10210.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10212.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't a political ploy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10214.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is me venting and talking with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10217.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the city, how do we move forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10219.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hate talking like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10221.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hate being negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10222.69s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want solutions, but I'm telling you, your frustration is our frustration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10228.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We tried to hold a meeting with the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10230.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council President worked her tail off to make sure that she worked with the school committee so we can sit down before this budget season to talk about what's happening at the high school, security issues, future budget concerns, other issues that we need to talk to so we can sit down in a room and work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10246.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We got word back that the mayor didn't want to meet with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10250.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We got word that the mayor didn't want to meet with us because she was afraid of the dialogue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10255.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's the mayor of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10258.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's funny, know what I'm hearing from people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10260.368s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know the only way you can reach out, George?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10262.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Start a Facebook post.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10264.171s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's start a Facebook newspaper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10266.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's whatever she puts out, you know, with Run Like Girls or any of the programs or whatever fluff that's going out there, the signings and the ribbon cuttings, let's put it to what's really affecting Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10281.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I'm afraid, July 1, I'm afraid July 1,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10287.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to be talking to parents about classroom sizes being too big.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10292.579s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to be talking about special needs parents of their children that can't have the services they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10297.98s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to talk about the three DPW workers in the parks that have to cut down to two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10303.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to have to talk about the 80 police officers that they have to cut down to 75.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10306.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's my fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10308.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10309.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one's dispelled that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10311.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one's told us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10315.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The only time we have anybody from the administration here is the chief of staff to call us bullies and tell us that, you know, sticking up from here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10322.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're wrong, she's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10326.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In the meantime, we're falling apart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10329.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're falling apart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10331.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You saw just what happened today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10334.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had questions with legalities that should have been taken care of in five minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10337.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we had someone, it would have been done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10339.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't had a city attorney for a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10341.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know what the dialogue is from the main, the administrator's office, is that it's very competitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10348.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just so I've talked to, I've talked to eight city solicitors sitting at a table at a memorial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10355.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I asked them, jokingly, hey, come to Medford, we'll get your top dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10362.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they were like, George, not if you gave us the key to the city, that place is a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10369.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's not just here, it's everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10372.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So long story short, I don't care that I'm venting anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10378.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At least I get some sort of satisfaction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10381.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I get yelled at when I get home by my wife, but I'm telling you, we appreciate what you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10385.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're gonna support whatever you ask me to do, I'm gonna do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10389.651s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I'm at that point, if you're frustrated, I'm frustrated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10393.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I grew up in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10395.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I did everything I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10396.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I got four jobs and bought a house in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10399.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I did whatever I could do to stay in the city, to make my kids go to the public schools in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10405.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've gone through McGlynn and Burke and now Lungo-Koehn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10410.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10414.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to hear the dialogue that her mission is to clean up city hall, holy cow, if that's cleaning up, I'm frightened to see what's next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10424.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I apologize, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10427.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are tirades that I'm getting sick and tired of myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10430.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I say it, my ears hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10434.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it has to be said, because you know why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10437.311s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the regular person that all they have is this evening to watch us talk, they don't truly understand what's going on in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10444.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10444.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11803.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for being here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11808.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want you to know for one Councilor, whenever you're standing in front of us, there's a sense of legitimacy and honor when you're here so I appreciate when you're representing any client so appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11835.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I, you know, you've been here, you were here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11837.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, our biggest issues is making sure that we make the right decisions legally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11842.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that understanding that this process and what it's intended for is what, you know, getting phone calls from people asking, you know, what is this for another auto body place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11853.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that having that clarity, just making that part of the record, if we could,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11858.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that this would be only an auto repair, and the license will stay with, it won't carry on to any, the new owner, that'll be identified just for this owner, and that if it's, she moves on, that the permit would die with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11877.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if that's legal, I can't believe I'm gonna ask your opinion as a legal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11883.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I don't want to hold anything up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11888.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11889.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we want to make sure with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11890.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then I know that the fire chief did put down that, this is a confusion piece, the legal piece that I have, no obvious violations observed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11900.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But then he leaves a note, this is not ready for final inspection yet, 424.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11908.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you know what that is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11973.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so I know that I appreciate that for the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11975.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11976.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I have been getting phone calls from representatives of National Grid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11981.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I guess there's some sort of is the city engineer on online?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11989.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so I know there was there was concerns about, you know, the National Grid<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11996.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what they're putting in for service and approval isn't what's to the acceptance of our new engineer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12006.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't know if they're falling into that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12008.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's a question I was gonna ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12020.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, so they haven't come to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12021.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12022.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12035.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12036.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's not coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12037.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It'd have to come in front of his body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12038.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have no, I have no further updates on that one because.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12042.29s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why I just, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12046.671s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Clerk, I didn't wanna put you in the spot, but I hate that we're holding businesses up, not just this one, but with national grid that maybe, I mean, it's not gonna help sway me in any way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12057.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm gonna see everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12058.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would move forward approval as stated with those pieces in writing that making sure that it's just a auto mechanic shop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12069.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And obviously the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12072.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that the permit stays with, that disappears with the... With the petitioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12079.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much, Mr. Beaton.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12272.045s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, that's the questions people were asking that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12274.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, with the private way, physical both ways now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12279.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Massive amount of traffic that's rolling in their roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12283.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are the questions they're asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=656.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=657.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=659.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=661.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: there's not much parking in front of Bank of America as it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=665.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the traffic study showed that there's no traffic issues or concerns, but how many automobiles would the lanes allow for the drive through?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=679.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I thought my first impression would be around the back of the building, but being on the side of the building with the lack of, you have handicapped parking in front,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=687.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just don't want to hinder any lines that would hinder any parking for handicap accessibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=731.839s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, I know what the problem is that the printing doesn't show I was I looked at it reverse so I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=738.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, I don't see it being a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=739.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=794.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do I have a motion from the council, I would motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=799.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The only thing I would ask my colleagues I know that when we do special permits we asked for maybe a 90 day review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=806.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that it's just protocol that we've<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=812.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to approve and support this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=813.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see everything is in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=815.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't see the biggest thing in that area is traffic concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=818.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't see any traffic issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=821.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so I would think to improve and then again, visit any concerns if there's any issues in 90 days for a full review for full approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=834.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to waive it if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=1085.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You don't have to be nervous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=1087.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You don't have to be nervous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=1113.953s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=1114.814s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How many employees will be working in the business?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=1118.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it family only?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=1120.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, I mean- Okay, I see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=1124.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see all the paperwork is in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=1126.705s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And before I move approval, I know maybe some other councils have some questions but for one one council we appreciate when families come in and start neighborhood businesses like yours and I think it'll be a huge benefit and a little competition on Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=1143.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for the juice, the juice wars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=1148.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know as if a bulb had just opened up, so it's exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=1152.02s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we welcome that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=1154.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would move approval with any questions of our colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=1239.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see everything is in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=1242.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I do know Jeff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=1244.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People aren't familiar with Jeff's business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=1246.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've been a very reputable and upstanding business in West Medford Square with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=1255.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: many people supporting him in that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=1258.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're excited that he's moving to a location that's recently been closed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=1261.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as you know, when something closes in Method Square, we often hold our breaths to see how long they're gonna be open storefronts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=1271.692s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Jeff and Ian have taken an opportunity to go in and you can see the work they've done already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=1276.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Very vibrant yellow door out front and welcoming everybody in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=1280.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're so excited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=1281.514s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, how many employees, John, would you be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=1285.756s">[Scarpelli]</a>: have any questions or comments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=1286.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Close to like 10 10.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=1288.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=1289.099s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, uh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=1291.541s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The hours of operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=1293.202s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=1294.663s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You understand the hours operations are and in any extended permitting, just come back to us and get things rolling with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=1301.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But, um, again, it's another, um, new business that we should be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2071.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpellillo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2072.526s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2073.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that one of the biggest concerns was making sure any of the outdoor dining areas are accessible for our handicapped and mothers with strollers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2086.695s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that having the inspector in place and being the overseer is going to be the important piece to make sure that all of those areas are protected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2098.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2520.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2520.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, to the public, I know that I've talked to some people in the streets and some residents that want to point fingers at different members of this council for the reason why the budget process isn't moved forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2534.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will let you know that Council President Morell has worked diligently with the mayor's office to try to get a schedule for our upcoming budget meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2546.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If anybody's familiar with what happened last year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2549.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We actually didn't see a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2552.814s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We both came in and may I had to come in at one in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2556.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to negotiate an agreement so we can get something passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2563.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that what I find a little nerve wracking right now is that they're having open dialogue with the school department and the school committee about a very dire situation that's been publicly spread that the mayor is looking to cut<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2584.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the education budget and look to let go of teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2590.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that to me is frightening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2592.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to the fact that no one from the city administration has even updated this council to let us know what is going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2600.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This has been happening for over two to three weeks now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2603.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This issue is happening two to three weeks, and no one<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2608.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: from the city administration has told us what's going on, either to calm everybody's nerves that there might be rumors or that what was sent out by the mayor's office to the school committee that we are having serious financial issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2624.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, we wouldn't know because we still haven't seen, here we are, middle of May, we still haven't seen financial paperwork of what's going on in a day-to-day role here in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2638.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that people, it's easy to say when you run to some people to say, oh no, this isn't the administration's fault.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2644.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't the mayor's fault.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2647.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is this group's fault.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2648.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is this person's fault.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2650.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2652.29s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right now we have a president council president that stands independently and works with the administration to try to get a schedule, so we can be informed so we can make the rational decisions needed for our constituents that have fallen on deaf ears, we've called for meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2669.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: over two months ago to talk about budget concerns directly with the school department that's dealing with something very serious, which was security issues that was brought forth that we needed to support our school district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2681.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2682.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the Council President again worked diligently with the school committee, the word came back and said the mayor was looking for a date, and then it fell in the mayor's desk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2692.73s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I know the sounds let's beat up the mayor, what this sounds like is logical information so everybody understands where we are today financially in the city, this council doesn't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2707.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know what's going on financially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2710.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All we hear is that there's a letter floating around with the school committee, and they've had multiple meetings to discuss issues and concerns that we're in dire fiscal issues that are gonna lay teachers off, that are going to cut the school budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2726.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, here we are, May 9th, I believe, and we know nothing yet, zero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2733.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No conversations from financial director, no conversations from the chief of staff, no conversation from the mayor's office, no conversations from the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2743.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I wanna make this public because I'm getting tired of talking to members of this community that just wanna stick up for people that they believe in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2752.763s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Understand something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2756.105s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's okay to look at an elected official and say they like them as people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2760.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I agree, I like a lot of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2762.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when you look at the positions that we're in, for instance, the mayor's position is the CEO of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2770.907s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That means they're in charge, they're the boss, they're the buck stops with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2774.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when we don't get information back, it's glaring that we don't have leadership that we need right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2784.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I'm frustrated, I've said it a thousand times, I'm frustrated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2788.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm frustrated for the fact that no one is telling us what's going on, and we don't know what's going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2794.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm going to guarantee you, we're going to sit here again on June 30th, and we're going to look at each other like dummies and say, what are we going to do now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2802.963s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And someone's going to come to the podium at one in the morning and say, I found $12 million again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2808.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I found it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2809.714s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm going to give you what you need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2811.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we vote on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2812.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2813.096s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We wake up the next morning and what happens here we are 10 months later, we still don't have an attorney for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2819.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still don't see a facilities person that's actually working for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2822.822s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still don't have the things that we asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2826.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the financial documentation from the financial director that was given to us from the previous financial director with the same exact software.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2835.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't, we can't get it from this council, this leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2840.289s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, Madam President, I apologize for going on, but I'm tired of people on the street blaming fellow city councilors and their party affiliation on why things aren't happening in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2853.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Things aren't happening in the city<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2855.304s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because of one person and one body, and that's the mayor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2861.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And believe me, it has nothing to do about liking the person personally, because I think she's a fabulous person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2867.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've known her a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2870.717s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as a leader of the city, I don't know why we're blinded and what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2875.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The frustration is real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2878.764s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm a city councilor and I haven't talked to the mayor's office or the chief of staff in over a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2885.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4287.486s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4287.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4289.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did, did you say that our engineer, did he put that in writing, or did he say that he called me on the phone when I spoke to that way he spoke he spoke to me Yes, those were his words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4345.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now the area you're talking about, is it posing a threat or will it pose a threat?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4349.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for residents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4382.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, of course he has a record for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4395.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, our problem is we don't have a city solicitor that we could speak to because I find this a bother.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4401.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, it's dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4402.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, and we also talked this council's also talked about the because we have so many roads that are private, we lose a lot of money that that are directly assigned from the state and the federal government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4420.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because when they look at Medford, it looks like we have X amount of miles of road because we have so many miles of private ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4428.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's something I believe we brought up in resolution to look into the process of taking back those roads and those streets for the fact that it would bring in more money to refurbish our communities, you know, dire need for the reconstruction redevelopment of those roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4447.165s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that's something that you know, we can revisit as a council later on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4496.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's a law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4497.274s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know that we know that that's the city's law, but which is that private ways what we can do what we can't do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4504.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, I have neighbors that live in a private way that pulled their money to resurface their whole street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4509.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know there are different rules and regulations, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4512.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think when it comes to safety, I think that might supersede any issue or concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4517.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why we've been told that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4519.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, we've been told that so I don't know what if it is exactly that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4542.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're saying is this council is supporting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4545.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the fact to look at changing all our private ways to public ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4554.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that for your issue right now, I think that we need to have, you know, somebody from DPW to go down and look at that, that area where you're talking about and to address safety issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4568.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if it's safety issues, I believe that supersedes any<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4588.272s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So maybe we could do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4589.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why don't we, why don't I make a motion that, okay, so what I'll do is we'll put a resolution in, I'll talk to the city clerk that will ask the residents to come up, the city engineer and a representative from the city that could come up and speak to safety issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4606.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can't speak on the law unless we, as a council, put something forth, which that might be something we look at, but I think right now in the urgency of this issue, that if it's a safety concern that we bring the people together<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4617.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in the resolution at an open meeting, so we can get to the bottom of this, because what I don't want to hear is God forbid tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4643.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the city, which to the benefit of the city that we're all streets and you get the revenue from the state, and we all get the same services and again there's a catch 22 we asked for this already, but because we don't have a city attorney that works with the council, we can't get the work done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4659.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we want it done, we have to hire KP law that works for the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4664.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and give them thousands of dollars to come back and give us the mayor's response of what the answer is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4672.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's hope so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=6774.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=6776.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think Councilor I appreciate brings forward it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=6779.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First of all, what's frightening is we don't have an IT department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=6782.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the first thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=6783.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First thing is that we have someone that's working I believe per diem or on a contracted basis, but we don't have an IT department, which is frightening because we can't get the answers we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=6795.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=6797.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: appreciate what you're saying, because people have also told me in situations that the city has gone out and asked for different feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=6806.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a group of educated method residents that send their feedback<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=6815.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And with those numbers, our city officials gather that information, which that's all they have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=6823.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they have to make the best decisions from that group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=6827.258s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we realized is that that group doesn't truly identify the true demographics of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=6838.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think if you would probably look at most of the surveys that go out,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=6845.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and that are replied to are really from one administrator that works her tail off to do the best she can to get the information to the people that are directly involved because they're interested with her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=6860.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's no fault to her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=6863.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's doing the best she can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=6864.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's doing her position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=6865.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I look at the rest of the city saying that when we have issues like bike lanes, for instance, when things go out, who responds?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=6874.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the bicycle commission people in the bicycle world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=6876.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=6877.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what the demographic looks like what's being said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=6881.544s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's no different than when you're trying to put a project in an area of low income.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=6888.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when the people surveyed are the wealthy homeowners in that area that want that development or they could sell their homes for big money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=6897.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it just doesn't get to the people that really live in the community and have no other option<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=6903.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but to live in that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=6905.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I applaud this resolution and I think this is a huge problem when you look at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=6913.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a disparaging lack of true community involvement because we don't have the tools in place to get it out in, you know, maybe different languages or reaching different demographics or, again, so again, I rest with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=6932.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=7304.613s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've been here for 18 years, I didn't realize we had a sign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=7965.553s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think Council President, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=7967.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor and Councilor Bears, but I think that appreciate Councilor Caraviello to bring this, this motion forward, because I think that what he's seeing, because he is a councilor that's been in the forefront of smart development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=7982.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's what's key.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=7984.099s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=7986.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you find developers going to Councilor Caraviello and talking to him because he has an open mind and he understands that to move the city forward, we have to look at the smart development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=7999.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that what scares me is you see businesses, big plans that have been put out for, I mean, we'll use CHA, the process that they were going to build at the site of Century Bank has now fallen through, I heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8015.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what that would leave us is, boy, wouldn't that be a great new car dealership added on that block?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8024.088s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And by right, that's what we're allowing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8026.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I understand Councilor Caraviello's aggression when he talks about a moratorium, and I appreciate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8036.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the the fear of moratorium and the open-mindedness to say, okay, let's not look at that, but also look at, let's change that word, but also look at the dire need of making sure that, like Councilor Beo said, is understanding getting that process in place and looking at our zoning as we go<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8058.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: looking right away I think that's a great idea that Councilor Caraviello can sit with your subcommittee and look at specific areas that we see right now are you know as well as anybody where they're ready to pounce and look at those rules and come back to a community the whole meeting that we all work together and look at those zones that we can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8080.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we can make some changes right now because I understand what you're saying because I think the residents like Council saying said, they're a little nervous, because they haven't had opinions, the whole idea that we're excited about why it's why what we've talked about in very important meetings we talked about the zoning consultant coming in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8099.304s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The key is bringing in a team that's going to work with the community to set up meetings to get the ideas of every set every community separately, just like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8108.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I remember working in Somerville 15 years ago, being part of the recreation department, sitting on this community meeting saying, this is what's gonna happen in Union Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8117.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What's recreation gonna look like if we do this development in Union Square?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8122.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And having the neighbor's input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8123.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm excited about this process, but I appreciate Councilor Caraviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8128.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is, I think, a very important resolution for the fact that if we don't make a move soon or quickly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8137.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And obviously, we're not getting the support from the from the from the city and the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8143.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like that we can put our minds together like Council be as Council saying, and look at some avenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8149.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I applaud that moving over to a subcommittee and moving this forward so we can see some action right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8155.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we don't see<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8157.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this development that can come in and stick there for the next 100 years without any movement and probably suffocate that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8168.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because it is, you listen, they tell you about the gateway of your community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8171.368s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a gateway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8172.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mystic Gap, for instance, is a gateway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8174.311s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The Century Bank area is the gateway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8176.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is where you come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8178.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That could be a perfect site for mixed-use area that we can really do some great things and bring in some real revenue to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8185.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we don't hear anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8186.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't see anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8188.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All we see is failures because I get phone calls from people that were involved in that saying, hey, just a heads up, CHA is backing out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8195.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I really appreciate Councilor Capiello bringing this forward, because this is probably one of the most important people pieces that people don't realize of the growth of this community moving forward when you talk about funding mechanisms, when you talk about lack of basic needs that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8213.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this is the new revenue that can help us fund that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8216.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, council, I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=78.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=79.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=80.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Covell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=80.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Council cover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=81.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll bring this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=82.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that, uh, it's been a very difficult time for the value family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=85.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that Steve not only just lost mom this past week, but lost his sister a few weeks ago after brave battle of cancer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=94.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, Stella was an amazing person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=96.584s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you knew her,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=97.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: walking the halls here at Medford High, you really, you really know, knew someone who loved the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=105.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had the privilege of knowing Stella as a member of our congregation at St.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=110.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Francis of Assisi and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=113.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: mom and, um, and, uh, and stellar and the rest of the mother's club at ST Francis really made an impact in people's lives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=122.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, uh, it's, uh, she's definitely a person we're gonna miss here in Medford, and we send our condolences to Steve and the rest of the family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=129.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=709.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=710.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a little nervous about now the Uber Eats and all these delivery services, the park on front and run in, and what it would cause for that neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=722.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So is there parking there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=760.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, that's a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=761.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I understand that if that was 10 years ago, but now with all these delivery services, that's something that when we look for these types of permits, it's something that I have to wait for the fact that they're not gonna park and then walk over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=778.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're gonna put three or four deep and run in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=782.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I would hate to put any limits on anybody in their business, but that's my concern right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=788.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But thank you, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1326.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How many employees are employed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1329.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1329.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is a business that runs successfully in neighboring communities, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1335.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a business that also runs in a neighboring community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1342.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I think this is something different and if it brings more people to the square, I think it's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1351.313s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I might find myself there one day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1358.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody can use some help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1359.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So anyway, so I wouldn't seek to move approval, but I know it's public hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1737.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I see everything is in order and the petitioners already explained the questions on employees, how it affects with parking, everything is in place and in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2870.168s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2871.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And Henry, especially in such a volatile time in our country when it comes to voting issues, I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2879.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, having you and your commissioners involved really put should put everybody at ease.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2886.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The commitment that all of you put in to such an important aspect of our process really should make everybody in the city proud and feel at ease in your efforts because I've known you many years and there isn't a more thorough<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2903.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: person or leader in our community so I thank you and the team behind you and all the supporters and helpers that you do have so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3439.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3440.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Commissioner Driscoll, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3441.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that this is something that you've been very transparent, and it's always a pleasure when you have the actual commissioner and his team come with concerns or issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3454.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3455.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've got, we've had a few emails and concerns about lack of lack of community input which I don't see, I didn't see where that that fell into place I think that you've been so transparent in that format and really involve the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3471.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I think that any housing right now in this format is so needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3479.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And anywhere we can find the space to make sure that we can enhance housing for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3486.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a demographic that has been missed, I think that is a huge win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3491.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we appreciate, I appreciate what you have done as a leader and moving forward to make sure that Medford has options for the people of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3502.768s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I thank you for your commitment and I applaud<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3506.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: your efforts and how you presented this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3508.911s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't something that you hid behind a desk and all of a sudden it came out and you know, the commissioner shows up or send someone there just to approve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3517.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It takes takes questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3519.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've always been here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3520.514s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what's always been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3521.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I tell you sometimes it's not comfortable, but you've always stood at that podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3527.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3529.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And also bringing your team and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3531.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: them willing to sit there and stand beside you is a huge testament of who you are as a leader.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3536.839s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, like I said, we've been talking about affordable housing and housing for seniors and like, and I'll repeat it just because I think it's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3547.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not ideal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3548.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not a penthouse on the water on Mystic Ave on the Mystic River, but it is the step in the right direction and I applaud it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3557.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3558.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you very much for the kind words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4971.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4971.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, thank you, Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4974.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is a direct correlation of the lack of partnership with the mayor's office and the situation where we are today with really being left in the dark and so many issues, but most important as this speaks to it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4990.922s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the lack of representation to assist us in making us, giving us the support that we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=4997.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And some people might say, well, why is this important?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5001.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the important this piece is bringing back full circle is the meeting that we had that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5008.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we had no guidance and then were sued by BJ's and then went to court and now here we are now I believe that it's now the residents are coming after this council and that all stems from one simple issue and that's not having legal representation here so again and that that goes back to not having a working relationship with the mayor's office so I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5037.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like I said last meeting, we'll belabor the process of the conversation again, but this is something that really, as a unit, I'll support the most part and look forward to putting this back in other elected officials' passwords of true transparency and letting the residents of our community vote to show us that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5067.563s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this is the process we need to go in because we really need to move the city in the right direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5073.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think this will help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5074.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President, I would second the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7608.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one know for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7668.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President, and on both of these orders, I think that I implore, and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7676.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: have my fellow Councilors understand the temperament that we're in right now the climate we're in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7681.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I received phone calls today I don't know if any of you have also from the school department that the mayor has already shared a very dire situation on the school side, that there will be cuts and layoffs on the school department, and believing that the administration's have a meeting here tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7702.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to rethink that and try to focus on how we're going to stop such a drastic move.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7708.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, again, to my fellow Councilors and to the public, I've been imploring all of you, without understanding the budget and without understanding what we're doing with the money in our community, please don't vote anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7727.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: money papers because we don't know where this is going to go when it comes to the presentation of the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7734.548s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I beg of you to please consider that I've been saying this and it's coming through fruition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7741.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: from what teachers have called me, and they're appalled, and they don't know where they're going after what was supposed to be good faith negotiations and understanding the climate financially this community, and what is being told to me by the school department of teachers in the school department that they've been told that there will be cuts and layoffs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7764.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So every dollar right now we should really consider whether we're approving anything, dealing with money anything right now, until we have further understanding of what is going to happen in our community, when it comes to budget time because of the lack of information that have been shared to this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7784.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've been pushing money papers through because quote unquote what you said was, we still need to do the business of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7790.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what we're doing is something unknown and what might happen is whatever we voted for is going to cause drastic trickle down effect in other areas in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7802.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is why I've said it, and believe me, I hate the fact that this looks like it's going to happen, that the budget is dire, that there are severe consequences that are happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7817.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I just, you know, I can only hope it's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7820.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But since we haven't had any information from anybody administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7825.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can only go with the people that reach out to me and share information, and that came directly from the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7833.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, this is where we stand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7835.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have your own conscious to vote on this, but understand, whatever you vote for, for one more dollar, whatever you vote on, when it comes to the budget season, and when it comes to the mayor looking at us and saying, we can't do what you want, and we're going to have to look at other positions, and then cut the assistant in the engineering department, or cut this program at the library, or cut this on our side, it falls on us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7860.745s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I know it's a drastic conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7863.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, believe me, I wish I was wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7867.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7869.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8293.792s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President, I appreciate my colleagues words, but again I'm going to, I'll say, if there's a reason why the male mayor only allocated a certain amount of money to the school side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8306.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You can only equate that there is some shortfalls on the city side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8311.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, this is what we're saying, again, we don't have the information in front of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8316.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The question about a $2 million, a $200 million fire truck order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8321.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The reason why we, I've always supported that is simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8325.065s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a process that had time table on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8328.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's going to take years before we address that financially, but the vote needed to be taken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8333.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why we supported it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8336.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I, again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8340.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it's being a little disingenuine when we have the union heads in front of us, and we tell them that we're supporting them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8347.518s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And their, their, their response to us was, I hope you would not support a non union positions raise when we haven't had people in this building that haven't gotten a raise in four or five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8362.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those exact words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8364.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these are the three points that were raised in my eyes, but I think three points that it's very, very effective to understand when we keep voting, even for another dollar right now, for what I've heard from the school department is really a glimmer of fear that I'm seeing that's going to come in front of us, hopefully by July 1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8388.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8392.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think, and here's, we supported the charter changes that Council B has brought forward for this purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8400.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why we all mostly stood together with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8403.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The fact that we haven't been part of the discussion, the fact that we have been disrespected and treated like our opinions don't count, and the ordinances that we put in place don't count.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8415.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's many different layers to this, but I'll be honest with you, I've been saying this for a long time now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8420.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And like I said, I respect everybody behind this reel, and I respect your opinions, but all I'm saying is, and I hope I'm wrong, when it comes to July 1, and we're looking at different drastic cuts, because even a bond, there's trickle down effect on how that money's being dispersed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8445.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8446.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It might be a bond, but if we're using money from one area to take away from another area to pay for a bond because it's spread over many years, until we know that climate or that's explained to us in a thoughtful, reasonable, responsible way that I can go back to the constituents that voted me in, that I could look at them and say, this is why I support it, I can't do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8471.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, this isn't,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8474.142s">[Scarpelli]</a>: anything to banter back and forth and say that I don't respect what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8478.071s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All I'm saying is that's the view that I feel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8480.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8481.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1666.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Clarification, it's a KP law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1669.041s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Boy, it's so serious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1695.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and Madam President, I support Council mates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1700.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, intense 1000% but anything that goes to K. P law, I will not support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1705.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2443.079s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2444.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank Councilor Bears because that was my my my response to make a motion that, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2450.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Obviously, this isn't the only settlement that we're looking at over $1,000 and to get a breakdown of all the settlements that have been forgotten or bypassed or not reported, I think we should ask for a report because this, like Councilor Knight said, for years,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2474.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a long time ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2475.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to say that because if to say that was the only one is pretty frightening considering in the past years that I've been on the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2483.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we've by this time of the year we've all always seen about six to seven close to eight settlements that we've seen with either pothole incidents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2496.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: city vehicles, hitting different vehicles, or even trip and fall accidents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2503.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, again, Council and I brings up the point that that I find very frightening is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2510.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we're not seeing what's really happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2512.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This lack of transparency is frightening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2516.436s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'd like to make it a motion that we ask the city, the mayor's office or the chief of staff to get back to us with any information or settlements that we've had, even in a spreadsheet form so we know what's coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2534.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that that's important because I,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2537.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, this is, this is frightening the fact that 2018, the sense that it happened and the reporting dates are so off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2544.01s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2546.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2547.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2658.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Settlements are different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2658.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe they said the judgments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2661.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Settlements and judgments are different, but we can ask for executive session to review those, can't we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2672.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure, let's ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2672.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if you've seen the KP law, what was given to us, close to half a million dollars, and I still don't believe that that's a true number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2682.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=135.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nsewk1d6HpM&t=152.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=112.868s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can, I can just interject just so I know that sure it's, you're a little fired up I just want to make sure that I know we get the opportunity to talk I think what Mr. Chubbs is talking about is the traffic commission meeting that was held last week, that there was some sort of approval or process that they're looking to take both sides of Winthrop Street, I believe, from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=135.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the park, all the way to South Street to implement bike lane safe bike lanes but would put in bollards along both sides of the street, and we've got many phone calls from residents that were concerned that it's going going to directly affect their life, their quality of life, the safety and well being to the families and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=155.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: businesses like the American Legion that is located right on that street that that need those parking spaces for their survival.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=164.827s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I think I just want to clear just so you're all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=168.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=540.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I appreciate the residents that came up to speak but I think that it'd be something that possibly we asked the traffic, make a motion that we asked the traffic engineer to come to the city council next city council meeting because I think that compromise sounds great but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=559.261s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's great if you live on the side of the road that still has parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=563.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that the phone calls we received, and I think the biggest one is the American Legion and the fact that they're a veteran service function hall that survives on rentals and having those spaces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=578.313s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if you talk about competition and they don't have those parking spots, they're just gonna leave to Arlington or other communities and they lose their business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=587.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's something that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=589.099s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this community needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=591.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they've been very good to this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=592.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the other piece of this is unlike high street, when I've talked to some of the residents, Madam President, the discussion was most of those side, most of those driveways are shared driveways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=604.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to access your parking area in your property, you have to go through a shared driveway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=612.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's beneficial or it's necessary to have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=617.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the parking on the street so neighbors can easily park in their driveways and then put their cars away at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=623.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's a different dimension that we never had to look at with High Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=626.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate you hearing, allowing us to present to our neighbors and I just move on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=635.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=706.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: want to speak during community participation, if we allow them to join us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1616.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: say redacted, could you explain what it looked like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1943.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1944.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to that point, I have a resolution that will be up later that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1950.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that will speak specifically to that and I'll make some recommendations with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1953.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what I wanted to do is really just thank you, Mr. South.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1956.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1959.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The common cry from this council is a lack of communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1962.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And last week was a great example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1965.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we're sitting here and we're asked to provide votes for raises for non union employees and then when Councilor Knight asked, but it's funny because it's not the name it's not the position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1977.313s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the calf so what Council night recommended or asked, could you please give us the name of the position for those caps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1983.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what the chief of staff did say first was the mayor and the city council to us as a you know forget about the mayor that's whatever decision but it's a council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1994.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We were never even talked about because we would have not even entertained just even bring that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1999.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, I find it hard to believe that, again, is there a representative from the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2010.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so that just tells you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2012.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So last week, I believe it was comments were made that, you know, the facts sometimes that you are presenting aren't true, but for one person, I appreciate the facts you are sharing, and it's easy to find out if your facts are true or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2028.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with one phone call or one Google of what you're saying and they come to fruition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2034.289s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So not like I had to, but I wanted to make sure because it's easy to come to that podium as administration and defend themselves because it's all they seem to be doing and look at this council and call us bullies because we're asking questions that pertain to serious matters of all of our constituents, all of our city members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2054.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're in a spot right now that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2059.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What you're hearing with our union situation, I think, is just a smaller piece of where we are in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2070.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're in a sinking ship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2073.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're in a tailspin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2075.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as a resident and a homeowner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2079.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm petrified, but I do want to thank you and your members again, I, I have not will not vote for money paper until I've been very clear, I will not vote for any money paper until<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2091.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We see financial paperwork that's showing us our direction, and that our union members are taking care of, because this has gone long enough four and a half years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2103.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a disgrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2105.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we talked about cost of living just last year went up seven and a half percent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2111.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're getting another, we're getting another kick now with healthcare, with the elimination of Tufts, I believe, GAC now is now moving to Harvard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2120.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're going to see a bigger kick now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2122.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, thank you, Madam President, allow me to speak, but thank you, Mr. South for sharing that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6862.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that concert.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6863.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that what was clear with us wasn't ever source.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6866.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6868.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was the police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6869.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was the city administration that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6872.981s">[Scarpelli]</a>: didn't inform the neighbors that would have had the option that would have wanted what we see in Winchester and I believe Winchester, they gave you the approval to do one pass and that's the difference between the Winchester side and that side from the line to the high school to the satellites at Lawrence, as far as you're going, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6892.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the Victory Park side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6901.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm glad to see that we're doing that, but I just want to be clear because I was going to apologize for that because I was one of the people that was really critical of coming to find out there was a lack of communication again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6964.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6964.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6967.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A few neighbors did reach out to me, and what's alarming is that there was an option for National Grid customers to add gas lines to their homes down Winthrop Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6985.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What's bothersome to me, and I know that, I don't know if there's communications between two entities, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6991.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They were, they were just I was just informed that they were told that they plan to do the connections may 1, and we are looking to plan to hot top that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7003.477s">[Scarpelli]</a>: April 15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7004.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So do you know if it's maybe it's not even with the ever so I speak but with Todd of Todd's on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7011.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can you shed some light on that because if that's the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7016.372s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Does he know about this project that, it was a petition by neighbors on Winthrop Street to add gas lines, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7051.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7053.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that if this will reach out to the engineer, but is that that's a date already certain that something's already been to the to our schedule that we've already issued to the city and they agreed to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7092.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we make a decision as a community that this is what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7096.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we're asking the but butters but if they're not getting back to us this is exactly why we are, we're getting the phone calls and what we are in the negative feedback on ever saw us because of the choppy work that was done because of the timeline that was presented by the city administration so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7115.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this is where you have to take a stand as a city administration and say, hey, you know, this is what's best for the whole community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7120.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that it's five days rather than 11.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7124.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's no seams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7125.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's one task.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7132.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's what I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7133.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, the milling and the paving I think that so I think that's important that I think that all plays into one as what we're asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7139.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8516.745s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President, I appreciate all the hard work that a city clerk has has done for us, and I know that this council has worked<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8525.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: very, very hard on putting through some initiatives that this community needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8530.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what I was referring to is the understanding of what the role in KP law has with our ordinances, whether they're legal, whether they are being able to move forward these ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8550.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I've, like I said, I've had the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8555.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The opportunity that work with many, many different city solicitors, and one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8563.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One ordinance rule 30 ordinance and bonds orders referred to the city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8569.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is in our charter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8571.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Every ordinance and every order for bond issue shall before its passage be referred to the city solicitor, who shall for with examine the same as to its legalities and notify the council in writing of their findings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8586.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It shall be standing rule of the city council that no final or definitive action shall be passed by this council in the matter of abatement<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8595.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: of betterment assessments until such time as the legalities of a proposed abatement shall be approved by the city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8603.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what's that saying is that it's simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8607.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We could do the exercise moving forward with the ordinances and what we're trying to do as a council, but in essence, having KP law review them<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8619.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is often not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8621.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: From what I gather, and I'll ask with a motion that we ask the city administration to forward to us any signed ordinances by KP law, I'm gonna guarantee you that it probably isn't because they know it's against the law because they're not acting city solicitors, because they know this rule in our charter, so in our ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8649.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is what I was afraid of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8652.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm hoping I'm wrong, because it is a lot of money we've spent with KP Law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8655.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But moving forward, I want to just, again, just stress to my fellow Councilors that the understanding, the idea of what we're doing is I completely understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8668.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to do our job the best we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8671.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when we don't have the tools in place to succeed, and we,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8678.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: keep asking for KP Law's opinions on things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8681.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It comes back to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8683.717s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This ordinance is very, this resolution is very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8687.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's an eye-opening resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8689.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it'll be interesting on my motion to see what we get back in two weeks with the city administration, where the signed ordinances are that will put so much hard work into passing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8699.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8703.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, I think that's going to be a telling sign of where we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8708.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that I'm going to make a second motion that's Council fears thinking about it since he brought it up and asking that the council asked for city administration for funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8724.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to reach out to former city solicitors, preferably Romley or Scanlon, that everybody else's work in per diem, that we asked them to come in and work on a stipend program where, or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8740.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a retainer that they can assist us with the city solicitors or get sworn as acting city solicitors so we could pass these passages forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8750.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these are two motions I'm gonna ask because of this news that was shared with me that we need the update from the city administration with the signed ordinances to see if they are signed or they're not left to be signed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8766.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that there were questions that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8768.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As long as the mayor signs off that they are acceptable, no, it's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8774.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the legal opinions that I received and what our ordinance says in rule 30, it clearly states that we can't do anything until the city solicitor signs off on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8785.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can do that and ask for the administration to allow us to bring in and swear in a city solicitor per diem or on a retainer to help us finalize some of these ordinances and other motions that we have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8804.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that right now are being left off to KP Law and their infinite wisdom for the mayor, not for this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8812.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8851.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I think this is where, again, this council is being bypassed without any legal support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8860.698s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So why do we need a council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8861.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why do we have our ordinances and laws that the mayor put her hand on the Bible and or about to follow the bylaws and the ordinances of this community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8873.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what we all did when we had the inauguration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8876.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we were sworn in, that's what we're sworn in to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8878.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is rule 30 of our ordinances, the city councils for our city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8884.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I would like to see those signed documents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11212.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President, I won't belabor this I know you know where I stand on this I think that this discussion is a healthy discussion the banter is healthy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11221.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is what people elected us for to think of outside the box and think of, you know, every avenue so I think it's, it's a.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11230.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a positive step, whether you're on the side that wins this argument or loses this argument.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11236.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I do think that my point is this, and I'll say this again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11241.963s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My fear is, no matter who is in that position, as we figure out this financial path that we're in, because we still don't know, and I know it's one person's race, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11261.076s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a lot of little pieces that have been put into place and given the money that we need without knowing what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11268.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, that's just another reason why I wouldn't vote against anything with the money paper, like I said, for the fact that we don't know our financial future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11286.681s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We appreciate the finance director presenting what he did, but that's not,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11291.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're right, it's not the complete piece, and that's what I'm nervous about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11297.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, thank you for the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=131.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President, Councilor Cavillo, thanks for putting this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=135.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've known the DiClemente family since I was a baby.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=139.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mom and dad worked side by side with them at St.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=141.65s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Francis for almost every fundraising event for the church and the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=146.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And Mr. and Mrs. DiClemente took over so many other efforts to help the members of this community, one mostly being the food pantry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=157.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: he would be there and he's stickler.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=159.261s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, he, you know, the stories are well-known that he wanted to make sure every family was serviced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=165.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So a gentleman, someone that we'll miss and to his wife, Jerry, I know that when you lose your second, your half like that, it's difficult, but just to let her know that the community supports her and are behind her and we send our condolences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=182.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=254.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you again, Madam President, Councilor Caraviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=259.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Joan is a legend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=260.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's funny when you first ran, when I first ran for school committee, someone said, you need to go sit with Joan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=267.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think you can get elected if Joan's not supporting you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=270.427s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and that's the type of person she was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=272.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what she'll tell you is the truth, the honest to goodness truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=276.311s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So she was someone that always, again, always the first business to give, and always willing to help anybody in need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=284.717s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So congratulations to a fine, deserving individual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=289.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1900.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1901.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, bring this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1902.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I think this is, this is an exercise for this council to understand what we're seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1907.518s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We keep, the mayor keeps putting capital projects in front of us and we keep voting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1912.981s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At least I haven't, but we keep voting these different agendas, her agenda through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1918.792s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and we still haven't seen anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1920.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Truly haven't seen the finance piece yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1922.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Although the finance director was here, wasn't enough, at least in my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1929.739s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second, we have papers in front of us today that should be in a capital improvement plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1936.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we're gonna vote for firetrucks tonight, is that part of the plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1941.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or is that outside?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1942.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we just gonna start voting piece by piece by piece?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1946.73s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So until this council,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1948.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: stops with giving everything they want, we're gonna keep going down this road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1956.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna keep going down this road because it's acceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1961.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're being treated like we don't count.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1965.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're being treated with no respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1969.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same time, this initiative is something that was brought up by a department head that talked about this capital improvement plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1978.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that when you're going to present it, we start the budget process when, but when should we start the budget process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1986.716s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're going to do a budget process at the same time we're going to see a capital plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1991.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's just distorted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1993.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't how you do business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1996.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, though, thank you for bringing this forward because I do think it's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2315.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's in the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2486.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2487.539s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilman Pierce for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2490.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But let me start off by saying it's a sad day when elected official, when I became that elected official, we used to watch the council and laugh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2501.187s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They were laughing stock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2502.368s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was all over YouTube because you had councils that were passionate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2506.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here I am sounding like one of the disgruntled city councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2513.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I tell you, it's frustrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2515.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we have to go to the lengths that Councilor Villes is going through right now and asking this, to go put this forward because we're not getting any information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2526.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not getting any respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2528.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not moving the city forward at all in a partnership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2534.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's disheartening and depressing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2538.539s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A good example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2540.756s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is the effort that our council president has put forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2545.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Months ago, I asked, I recommended, requested a meeting with the council, the school committee, the mayor, and the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2554.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we talked about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2556.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the concerns that I wanted to bring up is really just understanding the budget in a better way in the eyes of the school committee and how we can work together and also get a report of what has happened in the school district that has been absolutely devastating this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2574.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we haven't, from what Council President, I won't speak for you, but I know that she's done her due diligence, reached out to everybody, but it's falling on one person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2586.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what it's telling me as we proceed with the budget for one Councilor, I'm going to have to assume that the school committee budget, the school budget is fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2596.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm going to have to assume that the school committee members that came to us and said, you won't meet with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2603.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm to assume now that the budget is all set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2606.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The school budget is tight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2607.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've got plenty of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2609.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because that was asked for a couple months ago to sit with that committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2615.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I say the committee, it falls on the mayor because she's the president of that committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2621.311s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's chairperson of that committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2624.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And not to have that meeting in place and be realistic now, we're not gonna have this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2631.164s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're coming up into budget season, talking about capital plans, we have enough on our end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2636.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I could only assume, maybe we'll get a response back from one of the school team members in their Facebook posts, that the budget is perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2645.93s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because if you're not willing to sit with this council to understand the needs at the most crucial time that we've had in our community and our school department and over a few years since last major incident with the previous administration, it just shows you the lack of disrespect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2669.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It just shows you that we have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2675.474s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's comical in the fact that people come to me and ask me questions and I can only say, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2680.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's embarrassing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2684.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And why is it embarrassing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2686.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because when I met with the mayor, and I met with the chief of staff in that office,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2694.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're talking about, I wanted to meet and talk about how I felt and that I felt contentious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2699.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I want to get over that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2701.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I asked them to their faces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2703.33s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said, please allow the council to be part of the victories and part of the failures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2721.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor hasn't come to this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2724.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The chief of staff is sometimes on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2725.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We wouldn't know that because we don't have it in front of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2727.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know if she's on tonight or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2730.698s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not at the moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2733.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's comical because in neighbor communities, you have representatives sitting in the front row that work directly with their council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2743.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That we don't have to try to reach out to department heads to get things done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2748.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That shouldn't happen anyway, just doesn't look right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2751.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a liaison that works for the council and the mayor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2755.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know the mayor's busy, but not to have a representative here to talk with us and share these concerns?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2763.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you have this much contention and this much anger, because that's what I feel, how do you expect to move the city forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2802.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And excuse my frustration, please forgive my frustration because I know you all share it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2808.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know your personality probably doesn't match mine in the sense that sometimes I'm too vocal, but I'll be honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2817.64s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate Councilor Bears bringing this forward, but I will tell you, I hate it, but I'm gonna bet my son on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2826.763s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The city can have my son, my 20 year old son,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2830.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if we have a meeting here, if something comes out with these resolutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2836.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's how confident I am that nothing happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2839.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I'm gonna reiterate to my colleagues, let's keep giving her everything she wants because this is an election year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2846.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's make sure they get everything they need, make sure all the fluffy stuff looks good so she can move forward for another two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2855.372s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Some days you have to say, stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2858.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we need we get the respect that we need to help move the city forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2863.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2878.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4661.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4662.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So appreciate the chief of staff coming before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4667.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what in the past was called bullying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4673.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My, my passion really derives from the understanding I sat beside the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4681.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we shared different concerns and we shared the lack of transparency for other administrations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4690.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I supported the mayor when she ran for office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4695.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what I saw was totally completely opposite of what we talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4699.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was completely opposite of what she ran on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4704.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So our first term, I was very contentious, I was angry, and I called for the meeting with yourself, I don't know if you remember, yourself and the mayor, and we sat together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4713.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I asked you, tell me if I'm wrong, if I'm lying, I asked you, I asked the mayor, please allow the council to share in the failures and share in the successes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4724.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Absolutely, that's what we'll say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4730.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I haven't gotten a text message from you about what's going on in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4735.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I haven't heard any outreach from the mayor's office or your office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4741.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The only contact we had that I appreciate was with the last chief of staff accepting thousands of dollars worth of free furniture from the Furniture Trust Company that refurbished many offices in this building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4756.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then the situation, that same furniture trust company that worked with this yellow office or some office at City Hall to donate more furniture, and then get a phone call from the CEO saying, George, what is this letter that won't be signed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4772.264s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Which we agreed, we needed us to sign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4775.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With furniture that was already in the building, already being used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4780.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why is the lack of communication coming from the CEO instead of the chief of staff, knowing that I put my name and my reputation for this organization to come help this community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4792.92s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the little things that maybe you don't understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4796.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You seem to think that it's bullying or it's anger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4801.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, it is anger because I am passionate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4807.969s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We are a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4810.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There is lack of transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4812.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You just said it yourself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4814.969s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I guess if you're not the president or the vice president, we don't get text messages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4822.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's the frustration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4823.613s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why I support Councilor Bears's initiative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4826.855s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a charter review, at the beginning I did, I voted for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4839.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: would put the steps in place for what they wanted and that I didn't believe in because I've lost that communication with the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4849.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I lost that professional partnership with the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4853.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So absolutely I voted no to the charter review because I have no faith in the mayor's office that's gonna lead that charter review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4862.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why I didn't vote for charter review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4867.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4870.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4928.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You can't, the city can because it was done prior to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5428.169s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5430.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think, thank Tim, because I know that he's putting forth an initiative that I've been asking for since I joined the council, and that's having our own hot top and sidewalk crew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5440.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that would save us millions of dollars over years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5446.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, Tim and I talked, and it's not personal, I think that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5452.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the way that we're receiving papers and not understanding the budget, not seeing a capital plan, I think to me would be, is why I won't be voting for any money paper, unless it's time sensitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5468.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And right now this isn't time sensitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5470.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, I think we've been going through the slippery slope without legal representation guiding the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5482.373s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Attorney General did respond with the phone call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5486.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Clark, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5489.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And in essence, the result was talk to your city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5496.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe that's exactly what the Attorney General's office representing the state said, you need to talk to your own city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5505.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, these are issues that I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5511.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unless it's not time sensitive, I think this council has to be very cognizant of what we're approving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5520.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a matter of fact, I'm gonna make a motion as well that we ask for copies of all of the signed ordinances from the attorneys making it a legal document that is specific that we've worked on because what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5541.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like I said, I've had the ability to talk to former city solicitors and other communities and these are questions I can ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5548.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they're under the understanding that we should really get notification whether all the work that we've done, and all the money they put into that, that we've asked them to put in that the bottom line is somebody signs that to make that official.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5564.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it's not signed, all the work and the money we spent for them and all the work and time we spent in this room was all for naught.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5572.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm gonna request the administration give us a copy of the signed ordinances that we've sent to KP Law with their signatures making it a legal ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5584.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, believe me, I despise being that person on this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5591.842s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I despise it, it's one of the reasons why I ran, because I hated it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5596.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But unfortunately, like I said, and I thank Tim for understanding, my dad said, at 14, when you open this checking account, we're gonna put $100 in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5608.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If something costs $101, you can't buy it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5611.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, if we can't see what's truly coming in front of us,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5615.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we're making decisions without knowing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5618.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This would be great if we all vote for new equipment, and then we come to find out that we don't know if we have enough for staffing to put people in that equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5628.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So all we're gonna have is hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of planters that grind in one place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5636.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm just a little, again, this is why I'll be voting no, but this is what,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5643.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll express until we get the answers we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5645.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5710.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate that, but again, like I said, Tim, and I appreciate your hard work, but again, if we don't know the climate that's ahead of us, the last director stood in front of us at previous budget meetings that said we're devastatingly low or short for what is passable capacity of employees at DPW.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5733.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's when we have to look at, without knowing or understanding the budget, like I said, I know the finance director came up, who by the way, I'm a little confused about that too, because it's the same software that's being used under Leish Anomaly, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5750.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The software that was used under Aleesha Nunley that gave us all the reports that the mayor as a city councilor asked for, that was given in a timely fashion is the same software that our finance director right now is using, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5764.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe the chief of staff can answer that too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5767.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, maybe we can ask him that because the previous finance director didn't use a software as an excuse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5775.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything we asked for is money papers to keep us involved and knowledgeable to make these decisions Tim,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5780.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we received.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5782.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, this is why, again, maybe it's the seat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5787.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe it's the seat that turned you into somebody you don't wanna be, but I can't support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5793.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5827.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I completely understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5829.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe the chief of staff mentioned that as a software as part of this problem why this isn't happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5835.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just want to make sure that's clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5837.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6657.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, Chief Esteves is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6659.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Would ARPA funding fall into this category<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6663.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with what could that have worked?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7485.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7620.466s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, I yield to Councilor Bears for one minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7694.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7694.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7697.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Chief, first of all, again, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7701.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And more importantly, if I fight is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7705.168s">[Scarpelli]</a>: two giant fires in one week, and then not including, I'm sure, we assisted with the Somerville fire right down the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7714.293s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you're talking three fires in a matter of a week that were pretty serious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7719.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these are the situations where it's time sensitive that I need to support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7725.159s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I'm glad my question was really more of the fact that seeing what we went through this week and really needing the trucks that we need to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7733.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to function, making sure everybody's safe, is that I was, my question was also the third truck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7740.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm glad to see that'll be part of that capital plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7744.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it'll be something that I'll be pushing for because ultimately, this is about safety of our firefighters and safety of our citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7751.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and making sure we have the equipment needed to do the job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7756.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I can't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7759.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you enough, I think that we rest easy knowing that we have a department that, although we lost some property, no one died.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7767.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And everybody went home safe so yeah, I thought that that's very important so I just wanted to thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7790.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see the issues you're facing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7908.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7912.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, we're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7999.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8000.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Collins-Lee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8002.169s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will tell you, I did receive phone calls from union members that stress the fact that unless the equity and fair negotiations with non-union, with union members and not having their contracts settled<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8019.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with for years, I think it would go totally against what we have been preaching about supporting our union members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8027.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's one of the reasons why I won't and again, not a penny I will vote for until we have a true understanding of what we're doing financially in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8036.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8400.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8406.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, if we could, I'd rather table this to get further understanding because I thought that it was just 2% voting on our raise for us, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8654.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8656.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8657.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right off the bat, gentlemen, the sweeper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8662.888s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Does this mean we'll have two street sweepers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8670.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it functional or no?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8673.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8678.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8680.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is what, again, I'm gonna just, this is my, I'm gonna make this cry every single time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8686.766s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Until we know where we are financially and purchasing these items, it's just, it's irresponsible for us, it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8700.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8700.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know there are things like the fire trucks at a time sensitive, but this is just irresponsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8705.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Keep voting these papers through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8707.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we just did a minute ago is beyond me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8709.666s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, this is money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8712.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know where we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8715.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We keep voting for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8718.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I will not vote for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8720.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I implore my colleagues to think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8722.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8724.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11541.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to interrupt you Tim but this is where the frustration comes in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11547.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's like something this big right 10 year contract one of the biggest contracts we have in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11552.47s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now again, we're told that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11556.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: ideally getting the vote done right now and not truly understanding it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11560.486s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a part that I feel very uncomfortable with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11563.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's why we talked originally tonight about the lack of communication and understanding of respect with this council, because that's how we feel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11571.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, that's probably not intended, but it's how we feel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11733.417s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11737.52s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just to respond to that, then you weren't clear enough for this council to understand the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11746.353s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So because I think there are councils here that are very confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11749.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If this was presented to us, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11752.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hunt, then we wouldn't be talking about these other legalities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11757.78s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So maybe there was a flaw in your presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11763.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's where I find it being disingenuine when you've been in front of this council multiple times, obviously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11773.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when we have questions like this, obviously it wasn't clear enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11779.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11780.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12341.186s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information with that, you know, daily municipal RFPs myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12346.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's a slippery slope when we start putting in language that is really specific when you talk about procurement and RFPs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12354.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I think this is again where it comes in not having legal opinion because this could be, ultimately we can go through this whole process and then come back and say the process was skewed and then we have lawsuits from competing vendors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12372.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12376.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, it's just not having that communication and understanding, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6504.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=91.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=92.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello for bringing this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=95.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, Mr. Howard wasn't just a gentleman who<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=98.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: who created an infamous breakfast sandwich.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=102.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's someone that fought for our country, that loved Medford, and someone that really cared about his community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=111.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Living up in the heights and working on the board of Little League, we'd find ourselves as parents preparing a field at 95 degrees, and without field, Mr. Howard would be walking toward you with two gallons of water just to make sure that we're hydrated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=129.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They'll show up one day and drop off a bucket of balls that people didn't collect and make sure the kids got back went back to the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=137.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I love the story back in the blizzard of 78, when no one can leave their houses, and you had elderly families that couldn't find.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=146.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a gallon of milk or half a loaf of bread, and Mr. Howard decided to ration off everything in his corner store to make sure everybody lasted through that difficult time in 78.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=162.304s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I send deep condolences to the Howard family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=164.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know Mrs. Howard is represented by a name on the corner of Fulton Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=173.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I ask the administration to, with respect, add Mr. Howard's name along with his wife in respect of that historical corner that I think everybody should drive by, walk by,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=188.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: ride your bike by, look up and say, wow, I wonder who that person was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=191.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you can know about what it means to be a true community member and what it really means to be a Medford Mustang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=198.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because again, I've said it too many times here, who's gonna take their place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=206.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People like Mr. Howard stepping, passing on, who's gonna take their place to pass on the legacies that great people from Metro made up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=216.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=544.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=544.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I blame my passion and my outburst sometimes on Council Maloney because I learned from the best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=552.761s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He would wear his emotions on his sleeve and he wouldn't be afraid to say what he thought he needed to say for what was best for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=560.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And maybe from time to time, the rumors that he might have jumped over the rail a couple times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=565.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but he had so much passion to make sure that the city of Medford was represented in such a positive light.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=572.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he was a person that would take care and work for anyone in this community, whether it was in the Wellington area, West Medford, South Medford, even though he grew up, he was over at Charter Nav.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=587.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: he really fought for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=589.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, um, it's a sad day that Mr. Moody's passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=592.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I know that he's left a legacy with Gordon and Sean and Bobby.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=597.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, three Children that following his footsteps and giving back to their communities and, um, someone I'm very proud to have known and learn from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=607.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, condolences to his family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=609.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=684.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=687.509s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First, business, everything looks like it's in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=690.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Personally, I'm going to be very upset because I'm going to be spending a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=695.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My daughter loves the establishment, so now that it's in our backyard, I think the family money will be spent at Boba Tea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=704.756s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So just take it easy on us, but- Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=707.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I look, I see everything in order, Madam President, and I move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=786.065s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=787.005s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I appreciate Chief being here this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=790.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we just had a few concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=793.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One that I know that as we're looking at our budget coming forward and understanding that we might have some issues with the fleet and seeing what we need to do, we can do as a council to try to help move things along if we need to need to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=811.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to make sure that you get all the apparatus you need for the safety of your men and women.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=817.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that'll be the first thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=821.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then I know that there were some concerns about benefits for new hirees, that we can shed some light.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=857.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Someone's here tonight, so I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=859.041s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if you can shed some light on our fleet, that would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1039.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you have any questions, I'll yeah, so I know that one of some of the residents are asking that why is there a Boston truck and I don't know if we said maybe there was a fire and they were covering and then someone said what happened with the Boston truck was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1090.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this, I'll say it, Chief, this seems dire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1097.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This should have been something that this administration should have asked for two years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1103.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is something that is, do we have a representative from the administration?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1112.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so that's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1114.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I look at that because usually when you present a capital plan like this, it's in the capital projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1122.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't seen, have we got an update?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1126.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that, you know, I know that the mayor put out that the station, Main Street stations now going under this, that, and the other thing, and that's great, but these are the things that frighten me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1137.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is great if we have a brand new fire station, but, you know, are we gonna be,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1143.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, rent in a U-Haul truck and throwing some ladders on the top, because we don't have fire engines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1148.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's what I fear right now, because as you're saying, two and a half years away, and we're in discussions about ordering them, I think this council needs to play a bigger role in this, Chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1161.507s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we need to make a motion that we need to have an emergency meeting, as committee of the whole, with procurement office, with the mayor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1171.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And really, let's try to figure out a way to get this audit sooner than later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1177.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, I don't, I know it's not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1182.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not a popular thing, it's tough to be up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1183.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it is, but from here, I know how dangerous your jobs are, and not to have the proper equipment that you need, whether it's turnout gear, whether it's fire trucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1251.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Chief, I appreciate everything you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1253.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know this is nothing on you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1255.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'm saying, sitting here, we've ordered fire trucks in the past with Chief Gilberti and this administration, the administration prior to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1262.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So originally this council was involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1265.763s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what I'm trying to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1267.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we're waiting for the 30 days and you're sitting with the mayor and she's putting something together with other different departments,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1273.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Guess who they have to come to to ask for the money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1275.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They have to come here and we know nothing about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1284.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a city councilor, what I'm saying, this is what I'm telling you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1287.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You don't have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1288.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm telling you what I see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1290.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is that I don't care what other departments don't have paperclips.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1294.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our firemen, firewomen don't have the equipment they need to succeed and be safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1298.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know it's not it's not popular for you to say it, but I can say it chief and it's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1303.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you we need to have an emergency meeting with the mayor to see where this council falls in to make sure we're in the loop to make sure that we can hold meetings<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1313.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to clear any funding that we have to approve to make sure this happens within 30 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1318.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all I'm trying to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1320.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm only saying this because I'm in your corner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1323.764s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want to support your people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1328.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1329.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: working here for 16 years, whether on the school committee, city council, we've been directly involved when we talked about the previous fire trucks or different, different, uh, you know, uh, expenditures that we put out, whether it was for police cars or a new station or whatnot, but we were involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1347.681s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This council has yet to see updated financials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1350.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're, we're, we're nervous chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1353.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm nervous that we're going to get to me and we're going to come here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1356.005s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm going to say, forget the fire trucks, George.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1358.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We might have to cut firemen or firewomen, and I don't want that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1362.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1363.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to get together with the chief, with the mayor's office, and really start, because they've gone publicly to different arenas, and they publicly mentioned how awful the budget's gonna be this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1375.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And listen, I'm publicly saying this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1377.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've said it a thousand times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1379.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sounding redundant to everybody, and I sound like a crybaby at times, but I'm frightened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1384.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm nervous, because I don't know what we're doing here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1387.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This council hasn't talked to anybody about what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1390.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1392.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for the update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1393.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My recommendation is that we make motion that we call for an emergency meeting with the mayor's office to get an update on the capital plan dealing specifically with ordering the fire trucks within this 30-day window so the clock can start now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1407.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Does 2020 code that, Chief?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1410.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 2020 trucks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1413.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the possibility is we have to make them last for at least another two and a half years if the clock started today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1418.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's why we need to get the clock started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1420.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to do whatever we need to do as a council to jump ahead of anything needed that this council needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1426.52s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So whatever we can do, that's all I'm asking, Chief, is to get the administration to sit down with us and say, whatever we need, let's get this done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1434.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's understand if we can use our money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1436.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's see if we can, you know, what other funding mechanisms we can use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1441.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to make sure this happens right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1442.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's that's all I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1443.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, I'll give you an example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1446.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sounds pretty dire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1447.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're down a few a few trucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1449.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a we have a motion later on resolution today for another $1.5 million in sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1455.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1456.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't we haven't even know we don't know where the last 1.5 went last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1460.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So before I these are the issues that we don't know about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1463.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why I asked you to come up and I know it's I know and I don't make I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable in any way chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1468.507s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, you're doing an amazing job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1470.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, you have one of the best departments in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1474.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know and I speak firsthand for the way they treated my mom and my dad when they when they were leaving the service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1480.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I can't say enough about them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1482.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1485.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know, we can see the issues, but we haven't heard anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1488.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why having you come up and just shed some light, I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1491.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1492.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1847.719s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1848.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is Mr. Osborne present?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1850.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He is online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1926.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1928.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1930.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think probably my biggest question is that, I know the fire was first brought up, but since then, I was told that there might be some concerns with new hires at DPW, and new hires with the police department, and the lack of truly, lack of true communication with going back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1949.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that you sent us a clarifying email, and I appreciate that, but I have a question on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1956.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It seems that the comment that when open enrollment is closed, there's no way to get anybody on, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1964.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1981.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So just so you know, Mr. Osborne, I did contact a couple of neighboring communities and talked with the benefits managers, and I know that they have different systems set up that it's a 60-day waiting period once they are hired, no matter what month of the year it is, that if they were hired in January and February, they would then be, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2004.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: added on to the insurance for GIC on April 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2007.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's for example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2008.907s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Another example is February to March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2011.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They would then be hired May 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2012.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They would have the GIC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2015.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've talked to a few people in a few HI departments that have also told me that it's not uncommon<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2023.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for a relationship with the members of GIC and I have a call with them tomorrow to just give them a call and say, hey, listen, be a little persistent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2032.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe one benefits person told me that all she really needs to do is call them three times in a day and they'll get somebody on if it's really needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2041.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's that, I'm a little confused with what you sent and then what I've heard from GIC itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2049.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then the other piece is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2052.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: are all the firefighters that were hired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2055.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know back in February that wants insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2059.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have they been given their insurance or are they still waiting for the insurance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2062.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second question is, do there's still issues with the police that had some concerns and some issues and with DPW?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2072.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you can answer that, that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2109.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so that's alarming to me because I think that when I hire a new person in my position, I work with my HR benefits coordinator in the HR.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2122.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As they go on to the onboarding process,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2126.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the, this is part of their process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2129.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are you telling us that when they're going through the onboarding process, when they're hired for the city of Medford, that that's not the job of the HR department to follow through to make sure they're doing that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2139.73s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because you're making it sound that they have to come to you separately and ask for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2204.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm not just putting blame, I know that you seem to be a team of one, Mr. Osborne.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2212.304s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, we're fortunate that we have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2215.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: teams of six to eight that are working where we're onboarding people, at least that's what it sounds like to me, that you're alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2222.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that seems to be an issue in itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2227.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So right now, you know, no firemen, that everybody has, I know that I've gotten some calls from firemen that they still haven't had their insurance applied to their benefits,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2244.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but no one's reached out to you to let you know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2286.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, I know that representatives Buckley and Jones have reached out and mentioned that they would like to come to the meeting and maybe if you can, if there's any way, gentlemen, if you can, just enlighten me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2305.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was told, I was led to believe that there were firemen and women that were hired back in February that have yet to be granted insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2316.165s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or offered other avenues to get their own insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2320.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just want to make sure that if this is a wrong that we fix it, that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2327.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We look at the departments that need to get on board to make sure this happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2332.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that the police reached out as well, and representatives from DPW had some same concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2339.93s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I guess that since they're not specific to this, I'll call for a separate resolution with the police to understand how that's transpired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2349.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, if you could shed some light and your members appreciate just name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2481.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if I can interrupt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2483.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know it's a two month period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2485.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we figured out in February, they didn't have insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2487.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they didn't have that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2490.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's still a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2491.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have they had that meeting since then?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2669.168s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So more importantly, so July, everything was handed in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2672.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2673.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: August, September, he should have been on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2675.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is he on now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2677.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2776.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if I can, Mr. Osborne, if you're still there, I don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2784.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Obviously, is there a way that we can, first of all, correct this by helping these three firefighters get their GIC benefits ASAP?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2797.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I know that talking to, there's an open pipeline when you express these concerns to GIC directly with issues like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2808.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It takes days to get them on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2810.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is there any way, do we have that possible in Medford or no?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2863.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, so, Mr. Osmond, what I'm trying to figure out is if we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2868.051s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we talk with the firefighters that are in question, and they come to your office tomorrow, do we have someone in place that can assist them to make sure that this is corrected and we don't, nothing happens again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2880.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whether it's one side or the other right now, I don't care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2883.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wanna make sure these firefighters have insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2887.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that possible?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2932.695s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my hope is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2934.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My hope is that with the leadership of the fire department, that we can reach out to those three firefighters, that they can go to Mr. Osborne's office tomorrow and see what needs to be done right now so we can get that clock<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2947.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that clock ticking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2948.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you Mr. Osborne and I can I can have I can share some contacts with you with G. I see that there is a possibility when situations like this arise that you can call them and they can't support you within days that I know we've dealt with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2964.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what I find more alarming to me is that we don't have a system<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2970.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in our HR department that this isn't a natural onboarding system where they come in, fill out the paperwork, do the GIC stuff together, and that happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2982.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's more alarming to me than anything because this wouldn't have happened if we didn't have a competent system in place like other communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2989.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't odd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2990.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2991.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is, private entities, as they come in, if you work with a private entity and you walked in and you sat down with the HR directors of that company, that's part of the onboarding system of acquiring healthcare.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3005.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's probably one of the, after the salary, that's probably the most important thing you're looking at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3010.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that that's what I'm more alarmed right now is that we don't have that process in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3016.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I heard what you said, and what's alarming to me is that you're saying<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3021.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: let the people that we're hiring, who, by the way, we're having a very difficult time finding people to work in Medford, that they have to come and search for you so they can get the benefits that they are required to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3035.814s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because every city employee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3038.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is required to the option of GIC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3041.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3041.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to get in between what was said here, what was said there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3048.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I really don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3049.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I want is these three firefighters<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3052.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to get their insurance as quickly as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3055.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if you'd like to, I'll share that tomorrow with the information that I can get to you, that there's contacts at GIC that I've worked with directly that can help with onboarding special situations, like seems to be this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3069.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is, from what I gather, I'm not confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3073.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: From what I was told, Mr. Osborne, is that all three firefighters that are having issues all wanted the GIC and the city's insurance, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3100.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so for today, what I would love to do is get these three firefighters there tomorrow with our benefits officer and our HR director, and let's get the clock started tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3114.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's get them get their insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3115.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And moving forward, we need to figure out what we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3243.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That tells you the city doesn't care about us, but they only care about money, this, it's a little confused because I know that as as a negotiator on when we were as a teacher, and we negotiate we're one of the first, I believe back in the days, we were on the negotiating team when we were<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3260.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: picking the government insurance process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3262.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that we, that's one of the things with the teachers onboarding system that's done right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3269.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that that's something this council, I would make an emotion that we ask that we see the onboarding system that's used in practice today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3280.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and our HR department and then review to see how we can correct these issues so we don't have people or families without insurance without knowing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3289.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that'd be important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3292.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd make that as a form of motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3294.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then I'd also make a form of motion that requests that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3300.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that HR director reach out to these three firefighters directly and call for an emergency meeting with them ASAP so we can get that clock started so they're insured through the city as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3314.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I don't, I don't, personally, I don't, it's not hearsay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3320.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've worked with the GIC often.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3324.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is not a year-long process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3326.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is if you go through different benefits departments, they have charts that are set up that shows you if you're hired, and these dates, these are the dates that you'll be on board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3338.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're given, they're,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3340.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not going to share with you, but this is one communities that they share with the person that's hired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3345.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3346.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is your date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3347.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're hired in this date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3348.526s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Expect to have your G. I. C. On this date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3351.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's something we need to correct on the city side to make sure this doesn't happen again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3355.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, again, this is this is alarming, but I think it's something we need to correct as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3525.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3526.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3528.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can just just final question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3530.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3533.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have those motions in place, but if Mr. Osborne can answer, are we having similar issues with fire and DPW as well, and other departments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3545.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Police, excuse me, police and DPW, any other departments that, so we can correct that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5255.065s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5257.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I, too, expressed concern early in the whole meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5265.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with no outlook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5268.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or vision of our finances, I find it very difficult to support any paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5273.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know I appreciate all the work that Tim you're doing and your other department heads, but I hope you can understand that as a city councilor that doesn't know the financial climate of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5288.922s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then being given a paper $1.5 million to bond to me is very, very,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5298.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: unacceptable, to say the least.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5301.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that the other piece that I found alarming is that when we're looking at sidewalk repairs, we've also asked for an update to what the last 1.5 million that I balked at, if we all recall, that we all approved that because we needed it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5319.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to be honest with you, I don't see much work going on on sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5326.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and we've asked for a report of an update and we haven't gotten that either unless I missed that but I haven't gotten an update with that so I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5336.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would move to table this until both Councilor Knight's feedback is responded, his motion responded, and we get the update on where that money went for the last one and a half million dollars that we bonded for sidewalk repair, replacement, and stump removal, because I'm still getting a lot of phone calls that sidewalks are a mess, and I haven't seen that list that we've asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5366.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, I apologize, but that's how I feel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5696.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5698.868s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Tim, I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5702.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As one councilor, I stood here in my first budget and asked for a sidewalk hot top crew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5710.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We worked with the neighboring DPW commissioner that put everything into place, a whole funding mechanism, which isn't a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5718.507s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the most important thing they said was before we get that equipment, make sure you have enough people that are going to run that equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5725.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5726.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we're putting the cart in front of the horse because I think you're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5730.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need our crew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5731.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need this equipment, but we need the crew to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5775.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5775.761s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a capital plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5776.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I submitted a request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5778.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know the mayor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5779.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5780.186s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the whole idea is that truck and the equipment needed with three staff members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5785.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It wasn't a lot of money considering what we've been putting in for bonds over the last four or five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5790.698s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It really pays for itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5791.839s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I applaud your effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6104.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know the Councilor Knight has a motion, I believe, that I seconded, but I just wanted to make sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6112.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Tim, it's nothing against you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6113.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the hard work you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6115.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I think that to my fellow colleagues that we look at the lack of financial transparency and not understanding who we are right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6127.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think to vote for any money paper right now would be a huge detriment as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6139.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm only going to bring this up a thousand times tonight because I think it's important that we're going to get to May and I don't want to say I told you so because the fact that we don't know where we are financially and it's premature to be bringing money papers to this council and asking for things that might end up having a bond for new equipment but the possibility of hiring<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6167.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: isn't even on the radar, looking at possible cuts is what I'm afraid of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6173.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what, until we get a clear fiscal vision of where we're going and the understanding, I think it would be really, it would be really reckless for this council to be voting for money papers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6194.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, between the lack of legal support that we have, you know, and I think earlier I was so upset because I just keep reading this KP law stuff and all I keep talking to different city solicitors and understanding that every time that phone rings and they pick it up, it's $700 and the clock starts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6213.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with $700 and we don't know where we are financially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6217.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I'm going to share this a thousand times and I'm going to sound like a broken record, but I'm going to tell you, I think it's irresponsible for us to vote for money papers until we have the proper legal support and knowledge of our fiscal outlook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6234.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6987.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, madam president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6995.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6996.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate Mr. Lieberman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6998.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's been very active and involved in our community, and he makes a lot of sense at times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7004.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think when we're talking about money papers, I think for one, Councilor, KP law is an issue because we've made mistakes because we don't have legal representation supporting this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7015.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we've been left out in the cold on some serious legal issues that cost us a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7022.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7024.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My respect for Tim and what they're doing, it can't be, it's not questioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7033.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He is amazing, what they're doing there is amazing, but the problem we're having is understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7039.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we had our financial paperwork here the other day, financial director here, and he presented some sort of paperwork.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7046.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still don't see where we are financially in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7051.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So bonding and keep spending money, not understanding where we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7055.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It sounds great today and I think it's out of the box and let's do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7058.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7059.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7060.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we come to me and say, guess what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7064.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't know the financial outlook, but this is what it is today now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7068.311s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We now have to go to Tim and say, Tim, you have that great equipment we just purchased, but now they're gonna turn into planters, because now we have to lay off 10 DPW employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7078.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is my fear of where we were last year, last May and June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7083.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Don't forget where we were, that at one in the morning, the mayor had to come back from home and try to figure out a way to give us, find us $12 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7092.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's all I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7095.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know the issues we have in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7097.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We see it every day and we appreciate directors like Tim that are working their tail off and trying to do the best they can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7105.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But for one council that represents everybody in the city of Medford financially, if we don't see the paperwork in front of us, we don't see the numbers in front of us, no matter what was presented last week, because that's a great start, but it's March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7122.236s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7124.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7690.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, Madam President, again, I don't,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7693.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, it's not that I don't support, uh, traffic, uh, engineer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7701.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that he does an amazing job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7703.18s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I think that there's too many questions still haven't been asked or answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7708.544s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, when we've sent that out, I reiterate what Councilor Knight said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7713.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our city solicitor said that there were some concerns with the process and agreed with this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7722.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then, again, we get contradictory feedback from KP Law, so I'm left in limbo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7729.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think that we can move forward with any of these caps or increases or change of salaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7737.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Although, do I think it deserves it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7739.186s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Absolutely, but it's also, what we're seeing is you have other departments that people are picking up duties<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7751.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and not being compensated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7753.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll give you an example of the veteran director who was put into position back in the day when he was the hearing officer and he was waiting to be compensated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7765.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And don't forget that day because people that were here remember the injustice there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7771.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So here we are now in the same situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7774.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this isn't how business works in the municipality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7778.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Although as much as I like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7781.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7781.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't you can't be picking and choosing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7784.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's a slippery slope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7785.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, this is why, you know, not having having a conflicting legal, um, representation is a huge problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7796.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I won't be able to support this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7799.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8155.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8158.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8159.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just just to be clear, I appreciate these comments and I think that that's what's great about this forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8166.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, this is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8169.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as 23-057 then leads off to 23-058 and that's gonna talk about the differential in the salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8180.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want us all to look at that and realize that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8184.076s">[Scarpelli]</a>: does, because it seems to me that we're going to be losing a union position and all of us here are union supporters, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8191.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This compensation for what reads in the next resolution, the increase of the funding using salaries would be funded because of a highway salaries account due to temporary vacancies in the senior clerk position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8205.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So does that mean that we're losing the senior clerk position to fund this position?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8210.792s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8211.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8213.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what does that mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8214.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just for clarification purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8216.92s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when this person does come back, Tim, we're gonna hire this person back full salary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8221.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then how are we gonna pay this position if that money's being used somewhere else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8234.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Chief of staff Nazarian here, just because that's something that's important before I vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8238.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you look for both papers together, this is approving something that is still questionable because of not understanding the true legal separation of two different parties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8248.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But then the next page talks about the funding of that position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8252.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's looks like eliminating a union position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8255.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So is Chief of Staff here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8260.316s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She did say she was, though, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8297.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, just...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8299.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the increase the funding using the salaries of funded curve, the DPW salaries account due to a temporary vacancy and the senior clerk's position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8308.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That person is now, they hired the person now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8311.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was a vacancies back?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8312.953s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8313.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8342.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just clarify that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8345.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to lose that clerical position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8510.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8513.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8664.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Madam President, the Furniture Trust Company is an amazing organization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8672.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They are an organization that goes in, especially during the pandemic, and go into these multi-billion dollar office buildings that haven't even opened, that were built prior to the pandemic, and have furniture that is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8689.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: brand new and untouched.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8691.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they're brought in to throw away all this brand new equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8696.18s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what they've done is gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8697.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They reach out to all nonprofits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8701.544s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will tell you in recreation, they've refurbished our teen center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8707.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've worked with our administrative staff in the school department and multiple other locations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8712.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that prior to the pandemic,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8717.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Zarian, I know that all that furniture that was in here, the movie company, all that was donated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8725.486s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate the hard work that the Furniture Trust Company does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8729.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a former Method resident, Pat Redden, who spearheads that endeavor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8734.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he just called me today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8738.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's helping homeless family and making sure that they're donating furniture for homeless families and different homeless organizations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8750.368s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Framingham State closed the whole dorm and they took all of the furniture<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8757.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: bureaus and betting and moved it over to a homeless center in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8762.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they do so many great things and I appreciate, I know this is a hard, difficult thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8768.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It took a little while to get this signed off, but we appreciate everything you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8772.115s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Villes for pointing that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8773.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want to make sure they get their credit too, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=3325.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=3326.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: May 15th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bIcF9zSptpQ&t=3418.209s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and central administration, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=44.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=45.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll bring it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=46.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A true gentleman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=50.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Russ was someone that was a pillar of our community and will be greatly missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=55.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So may he rest in peace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=59.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=552.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=553.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=559.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Next meeting, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=700.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I think that I think Councilor Knight bringing those words up, I think that it's important when we're looking at it with the oversight that's needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=709.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, it's the only reason why I am voting for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=712.796s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Anything like I said, that deals with any fiscal responsibility or requests in this body, I would not support for the fact that we still have no idea of our fiscal future here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=725.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=726.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have no, had no discussions with the mayor of the administration and guide us where we are financially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=733.922s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, that's a dire situation, but I would support this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1388.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1390.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The question I have is, as I know in the past before your entry to this wonderful position, we had a question we had with all the road work that's being managed throughout this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1404.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How have we set it up that since we don't have a clerk of the works, how do we manage<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1414.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the work of one, let's say, National Grid comes in, sets a trench, leaves, who's monitoring that at the end of the project?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1422.792s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because that's typically been the issue, that we just don't have enough people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1437.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: keeps eyes on things and we tend to find out what's so but we don't have anything formal like in place where it says, you know, we have an alert systems is job, you know, job, job, a from National Grid, public street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1544.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1768.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I completely understand what you're asking for as a member of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1774.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In our business, in the recreation business, when we're asking for what applies, it sounds great, but because of the pending snow and- And the spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1783.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1786.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was a confusion, so I think that, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1787.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I think that anywhere there are parks, I think that I would second that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1792.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, once we have, you know, during the spring season where we have the traffic that we have now at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1801.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Doug a park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1802.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's important that we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2036.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I thank Vice President Bears for bringing this forward, but this is common practice in most municipal budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2045.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're further along in our budget where I'm working with municipal government that I work for, and it's very transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2051.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is where I find my frustration that what Councilor Bears just asked for is truly a press of a button of spreadsheets and really help everybody involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2064.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, that magic word of transparency, we use it, but I think we should follow it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2069.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think it's important that this initiative moves forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2075.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate the efforts Vice President Bears and I move second on this paper, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3085.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3086.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Collins, Councilor Villes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3088.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know this took a lot of time, but I've been steadfast in my<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3095.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: my view of our business and the lack of legal representation that could guide this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3103.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And without that, that's one of the many reasons why I can't support this this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3109.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like Councilor Knight said, there are 12 amendments of an ordinance that needs to be changed and how that affects the technology piece, not just this situation, but moving forward in other situations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3122.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I'm gonna say this again, Councilor Knight put it one way, I'll put it the way that I've been saying it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3129.999s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've been trying to do the city's business without a city attorney that represents this council, that guides us on ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3139.922s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The recommendations from KP Law, I don't even know if they would be valid for the fact that they don't work for this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3148.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So any legal information that we need to back from dealing with the legality of this or any of the questions that we had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3159.698s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I really can't trust or depend on, and to support this right now would be no different than any of the other papers that I've not voted for because of the lack of legal guidance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3170.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I hope you can understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3172.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3173.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that this took a lot of work, and I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3177.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3275.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3277.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In no time do I question your ability or I'm disrespecting you in any way, madam, my fellow council, but like I said, and the other votes we've taken, we've talked about this and I've been steadfast on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3292.107s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even with the knowledge of the city administration or the knowledge of outside parties or your intense work, I still, still doing the city's work and making sure<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3304.69s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that anything I vote on, I feel secure legally that I've done the right thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3309.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I bring this back all the way back to BJ's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3312.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We voted on something that we thought was right because the work of this council, we thought we put in how we felt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3317.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It came back and we were sued and we lost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3319.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we lost money tenfold, whether it be attorneys fighting the fight or fighting the appeal or whatnot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3326.747s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that that's my point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3329.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing else right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3331.071s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that this is the reason why<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3334.148s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that this is the frustration that Councilor Knight brought up when it came to Councilor Beza's last paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3340.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about the partnership with the mayor's office and this council working together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3350.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In other municipalities, there is a liaison that works directly with the mayor's office that works as a partner with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3358.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we had some issues and concerns and negativity going back from this office, I sat with the chief of staff, I sat with the mayor, and I said, please, allow us to share in the celebrations, but as equal share in the negative issues that are happening, that we can work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3377.945s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's just not happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3379.945s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And until it starts to hurt,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3383.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have not, I haven't voted for a money paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3386.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will not vote for money paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3388.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the city administration has to understand either we start getting along, we start fulfilling the needs that we need as a council that we've asked for for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3397.47s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can't support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3398.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It has nothing to do with, I appreciate what you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3400.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate your knowledge and the time you put into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3402.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, no disrespect, but you're not an attorney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3407.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the people in that office I'm working for this, this, this office, this, this department, and we don't have anybody that's that's guiding us, because I will tell you, I did contact city solicitors that I used to work with, and they, they recommended that George you don't, you shouldn't do anything until you get a representation from your city solicitor because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3427.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They don't know, they've never heard this before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3429.47s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's no definition of who is guiding us in signing any ordinance, let alone this ordinance, but any ordinance moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3437.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if it's coming from, you know, support and who's guiding us, who's pushing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3443.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's why I'm cognizant and a little leery of anything we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3448.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that I've talked to Councilor Biaz, I've talked to Councilor Morell about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3451.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we have to do the city's work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3453.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But there are some things we just can't, can't push forward without having what I feel comfortable for the constituents that put me here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3460.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate it and I apologize, but I thank you for respecting both of our opinions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3465.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3950.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3951.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Chief, since your tenure as a chief, have you seen, is there identified issues with what we're talking about that people's civil liberties have been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3962.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: harness harmed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3998.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So two Sundays ago, I was personally involved in a road rage incident where a person, I had my son and another guest in my car,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4011.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: up and down 93, young person driving crazy, slowing down near an exit, threw a bottle off my car, contacted the state police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4024.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we're traversing, they were taking off the exit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4030.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Person was making motion that he was gonna shoot me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4033.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we came closer, and we were really slow because they were slowing up going to the exit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4039.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That person then slouched down into a seat, and I heard my son scream, dad, he's got a gun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4047.779s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked to the state troopers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4049.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They ran the numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4050.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, it wasn't the plate, the number with the car that we set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4056.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Got a phone call yesterday from the state police, thankfully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4059.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I expressed that evening was not even that the gun issue, but the fear for my family that if he has my license plate,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4069.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What is he gonna do if he's gonna brandish a gun on the highway?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4076.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: State Trooper called me yesterday, told me thankfully for the surveillance cameras on the Cloverleaf, they identified the car to the plate that we gave, and they followed through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4089.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He couldn't give us any more information, but to say that, it's safe to say that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4099.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's documented, they know it, but there's a history there with that situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4109.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I can tell you firsthand, I know my son and his friend haven't slept because of that fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4121.165s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want to share that with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4122.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate how state troopers do their due diligence using that form of policing in a sense that, and it really wasn't used for policing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4131.427s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's really used for traffic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4133.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when you talk about a gun, they really triggered something for them to look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4139.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there was history there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4141.429s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just wanted to share that with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4143.65s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6834.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not the way I read it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6835.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6837.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, not to disrespect my fellow councilors that are speaking on this issue, but again, the intent of law and the understanding, we do not have anyone behind this rail that's an attorney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6852.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: which poses another issue and concern that we have with a lack of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6858.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And like I said, I'll say it again, most communities is there's representation for the council that's present with us that you can call the podium and ask these questions to make sure we're protecting us, the fiscal responsibilities of the community and our laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6877.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, it just,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6880.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think that people, my frustration comes in understanding how serious this is without not having legal representation as we move forward with these ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6891.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, just something I needed to share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6894.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1093.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Mr. South, I appreciate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1095.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the updates because I don't think people understand, you know, when you see the mayor come up and they do the state of the city address and everything's happy and, you know, skate with the mayor, that's a new one that's coming up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1108.177s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what infuriates this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1110.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I remember just a few short years ago, this body, including the mayor, talking about the essential workers and how important they were during the most difficult time in our history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1123.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: people that got up every single day to make sure the streets are plowed, make sure that the parks are clean, making sure that the pipes that burst are fixed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1134.716s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We made sure that our municipal workers, our DPW, were applauded, and this is a true slap in the face when it comes to what I'm hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1145.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I have a dumb question, because I can only imagine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1149.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know what's going on, but I will tell you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1152.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as a first member of this community, I see each and every member that's sitting behind you in their trucks every single day, working every single day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1161.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I haven't seen one iota of change, and that's what I find impressive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1166.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my question truly is, how is the morale of this team?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1170.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, I know, are we filling openings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1173.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, are they still doing the job of our minimal<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1177.362s">[Scarpelli]</a>: compared to what we were looking for during negotiations when we heard the ridiculous numbers, when we talk about a city the size of Medford and the DPW team that we have and how limited it is, that hasn't changed, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1328.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that this is what bothers us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1331.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, you know, I'm hearing from from colleagues and neighbor communities that they they used to say they used to open a bottle of wine on a Tuesday night to watch Council Penter and Council Camuso go after each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1342.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they thought that was funny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1344.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what you had there, you had two people that they had different views, but they both loved Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1349.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was the key.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1350.459s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they wanted Medford to be the greatest city in the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1354.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'm seeing right now is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1356.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what I'm hearing, what I'm seeing right now, not getting any financial paperwork.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1360.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know where the city's finances are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1363.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If this is an indication, I think this is pretty scary, that if she's only offering 2% to the most, the hottest working people in our workforce, that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1373.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're only offering 2% standing there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1376.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I find it scary to where we're going to be in June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1379.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So for one, I'll do anything and everything that I'm not afraid to stand on any soapbox if it can carry me and say whatever has to be said for the men and women that work for our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1391.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that what we're seeing, what I'm hearing, is that the morale in this community is terrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1397.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The workforce just isn't there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1400.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And everybody's being pit against each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1403.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what keeps coming back to me, the mayor made a comment that it's difficult to clean up city hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1412.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm still confused with that comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1414.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know where that's coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1415.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's been in office now, it's in her fourth year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1418.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know what that means because all I'm seeing right now is a city that has no leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1425.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm seeing a city that has no directors and no leaders in different departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1430.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a city council that has no power.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1434.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're an absolute laughingstock when I'm talking to colleagues in other communities that they can't believe what we have to do as a council when we're asking for simple documents to do our job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1445.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, are you just negotiating?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1446.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is this the, it's not the chief of staff, it's not the HR director anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1450.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we gave him a fancy name with more money, but I don't, you know, that's the other piece is when we talk about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1458.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the higher level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1459.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1460.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You probably have it somewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1461.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if you could forward it to us, I'd like to see what the leadership at the school system is making.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1467.236s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to see what the leadership here at City Hall is making that are in that are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1472.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: are negotiating with you because I bet you they're not worrying about how they're gonna pay their sons or daughters tuitions that members behind you have kids going to school as cost of living increases or the price of gasoline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1484.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So for one council, I'll do anything, any invitation that's offered to me, I'll gladly join in and share my support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1493.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think what people really have to understand out there is that we're not in very good shape in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1498.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is a great example of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1500.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The teachers settled, but they're not happy either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1503.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're not happy either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1504.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know they're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1506.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but they know they had to go back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1508.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One thing we're seeing from our DPW employees, they're not stopping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1511.92s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There is no threat of a strike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1514.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're still doing the job above and beyond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1517.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I applaud them all and I applaud you for sticking with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1521.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you've named a couple of communities that I know employees that work there and are so pleased the way you negotiated fairly with their negotiating teams in different communities and their outcomes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1533.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what's so frustrating with this community<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1536.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, it just, it brings a fear to my heart that if she's only offering 2%, how bad are we looking financially?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1548.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one's telling us, no one Mr. Selk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1551.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm just afraid what's gonna come in a few months because this is a scary time and method.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1558.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think people need to stand up and wake up because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1563.165s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When the dust settles, the people behind you are still gonna be the ones standing up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1568.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're still gonna be up at two in the morning plowing our streets to make sure our kids have a safe walk to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1573.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're gonna be the ones, when your basement's flooding, the first ones in the basement dealing with that junk in your basement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1580.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: no question about it, and they need to be treated fairly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1583.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So for one Councilor, I'm going to stand beside you or in front of you to make sure that someone has to listen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1589.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate what you're doing, and I appreciate everybody's hard work behind you guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1595.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sick to my stomach because I, you know, I'm, again, I hate to say it, but I work in a community that has hundreds of DPW workers that are making a lot of money, and then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1607.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The administration, they are looking at readjusting their pay scale for what their wage analysis looks like with cost of living.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1615.51s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I can't imagine what our next negotiation looks like in my community that I work in, because it's fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1623.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They want to keep people happy and in their community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1625.636s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're doing here in Medford is scaring people off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1628.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and no one's going to want to be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1629.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that scares me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1691.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To interject, and I don't want to be rude, but I sat at a fundraiser with eight former city solicitors, and I offered them all as a joke to please come work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1700.261s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll try to get them whatever they want to come to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1702.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the answer was, are you kidding me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1704.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We see what's going on there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1706.165s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It has nothing to do with what we're hearing, that it's the climate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1710.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's very difficult to get people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1713.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, it's getting very difficult to get people that can work here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1716.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what we're seeing firsthand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1915.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And in the community I work in, I hired someone yesterday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1919.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That person starts with health insurance the day they start, which is February 18th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1923.532s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that is, that is completely false.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1926.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I deal with that every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1928.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To say that they have to wait for an open enrollment is false.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1931.105s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a disgrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3035.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3037.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3037.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, I know before, I'd like to move back to the regular order of business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3044.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: made a comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3044.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want to make sure council president I did talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3048.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we called for a meeting with the school department to work together to see what what the process is with security and how that's going and then looking to see what funding mechanism we need moving forward for support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3060.353s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that the council president has been working hard to try to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3064.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: knocked down a meeting with the superintendent, the mayor, the school committee and the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3069.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can work on that, at least work on that piece and to see where we are, where we need to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3073.719s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just wanted to give you an update with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3077.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3077.963s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3525.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for counseling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3526.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I bring this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3526.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Granada is definitely someone that, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3531.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that anyone can go to, especially in the political field, to talk to him and get the true insight of what the energy is in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3542.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's someone that has that type of knowledge and that type of passion and love for the city of Medford is someone that's so vital to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3551.045s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we haven't seen him around much, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3554.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that he's someone that we should be very proud that we can call him our friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3559.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I wish him a happy birthday and many more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3564.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4064.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4066.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think the representatives BJ's and of course our neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4070.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I received multiple phone calls and and the understanding of the process and where we are today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4078.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, it's it's a pleasant, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4082.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: pleasant response by the BJS team and what was asked for to really support those neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4089.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that was probably the biggest sticking point of what was in the past I know that it was called the flagship store but it sure wasn't shown that way by our neighbors and the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4105.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the concessions and the understanding of the commitment from BJ's and what really is being put back into our community into the plant to make it look<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4115.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: very appealing and a welcoming site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4119.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything that we asked for in the council, I think that we found a way to capture that, but I know that there were a couple of questions that I know usually Councilor Knight, since we don't have legal representation here, that anything that's permitted stays with the permit, Councilor Knight, is that with the permitting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4139.16s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so that was one of the questions I was asked, that if BJs happen to, we don't see it happening, although they'll close, but one of the questions, what happens to that site if BJs does step away?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4155.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What happens to the tanks in the ground, to the environment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4160.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Does this permit go with the permittee or does it go with the land?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4168.105s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's one of the questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4169.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then the other question that came up and it was just passed over a few weeks ago was that back gate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4178.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the gate on the Felsway side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4181.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that there was some talk saying that back there was arrangements that that was closed at the end of the evening to stop any traffic coming in from Felsway as people use it as a cut through to come through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4191.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So and as I recall, that was one of my jobs as a former employee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4198.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, that I had to that's when the end of the night if you bring the carts in at the end of the night,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4203.293s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the last person would have to go, whoever worked the tire shop, would go and just lock the gate and the first person the next morning would open the gate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4211.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't know if that's something that is, no one seems to know if it's true or the intent of it, but I know the residents had a question that it really made, whether we see it or not, they saw a big difference, not having that access after hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4226.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I explained to them that when the delivery trucks come in,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4230.855s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then they responded back by saying but George that question is that there are going to be delivery trucks idling in the parking lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4237.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that shouldn't be an issue so that might be something that just just to look at I know that we've already asked a lot and you've really come back with a lot of great responses and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4247.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I also had to explain to the residents our situation on the council and why this went to court and why it came back and really give BJs a lot of credit for opening that line of communication again so we can really get the true context back to BJs to say this is what our community really needs to make this work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4272.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, and again, the last piece was, I'm sorry for being winded, but these are the phone calls I got, was that the idea of the trees on Woodruff, if they die, and PJ's really put in a statement that says if it's anything to do with snow, they'll replace those ones that have died as they move through, but the other piece is, it is up to the city, and this is, you saw our DPW workers here tonight, and it's gonna be tough for them to do,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4302.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they're gonna be the ones maintaining that area after BJ has planted and implemented that look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4310.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that we explained the fencing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4313.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about the fencing people asked for and the new slats that are going in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4317.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know we're gonna see a major change, but what I like and I appreciate is that there is someone identified at BJ's that's going to be working directly for the neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4326.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if I get a phone call from someone on 4th Street and they say, George, this is what's happening,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4331.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can directly call to the whether it's the code enforcement officer called directly to the maintenance facilities person to be jays and they can get that response to that resident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4340.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can get that taken care of something that we haven't seen in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4343.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4345.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, it's really those three things matter, President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4347.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4496.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the concert night again, if BJ's would leave in a hundred years, they have to go through the same process, like as we're implementing this process as a restriction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4505.574s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The last piece is, what is the traditional situation when it comes to gas tanks removal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4511.459s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If say BJ's would leave in a hundred years, who for environmental purposes, that was the question I got from someone, are the tanks left abandoned and what harm that would do or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4523.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that something we could implement that if at any time BJ's does close their doors and abandon that site that the tanks have to be taken up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4534.541s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that was the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4587.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4587.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That answers most of the questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4589.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4591.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you have a question about the gate, they have a gate if you know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4594.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean you can get back to us and just I think that was one of those are the three questions that I did get phone calls from neighbors that, and I explained, shared your information so I really appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4606.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, the gate for some reason, especially for the older ones that remember when it first opened, that that was part of the negotiations they sat with and keeping that open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4615.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But after business hours, they would close that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4648.814s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that was the question they had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4651.099s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what I told them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4651.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I shared that with them about the trucks coming in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4653.78s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I also shared that you've already hired a towing company, a contract with a towing company, that any truck that's not supposed to be there is being towed out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4662.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we also appreciate the sweeping trucks after 11 o'clock, that that's been in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4669.544s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that was a point of contention in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4671.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we see a lot of movement, but again, I think that's just clarification on the gate, was that if that's the question, if that's the concern,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4679.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: at the end of the night keeping the trucks away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4682.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The question there was, well, George, why is that a problem if it's after hours and the trucks out there coming in anyway?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4690.77s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that kind of makes sense in the sense if they can't, if there are no trucks coming there, why not close that for, and what they're seeing is the vehicular traffic that's coming down there and causing the speeding or using the cutthroat to get to Wendy's or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4707.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, so that's their concern that in the middle of the night, those houses that have bought the drive on the side, that's where the hair and the, you know, the engines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4715.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, so that's, and I think that a lot, it's going to help with those months with the race, the speed bumps that we're putting in for those months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4725.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's going to help a lot because I know we hope there's not going to be much speeding in the winter months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4730.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but if people want to be racing their cars usually during the spring and the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4736.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we understand, but I think that's what clarification with the residents and I appreciate your time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4742.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for the attorney of KP Law for answering those, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6150.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a direct line to BJ's that as a facilities person going to answer that question for us to take care of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6156.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the other piece too, is this is something that we'll add as we move forward, but making sure the DPW saw them today, we don't have enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6163.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they're going to be overseeing that land and that whole, that's going to be maintained by the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6170.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, you know, on the other side that, you know, that we follow through with the police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6175.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I like to hear that we've already started a process with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6178.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a contract that BJ's has with the tow truck company that anybody's in there idling and they don't move themselves, they're going to be hitched and they're going to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6186.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's big, that's big.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6251.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, no, it's this that the parking lot is big enough that it's the truck had to make a U turn, because I know that, but the parking lots wide open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7321.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything looks like it's in order, and I know that Councilors will have some questions, but just a brief description.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7328.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are you changing over management?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7330.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, yeah, I just recently bought the store, but we will keep everything the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7335.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything's the same?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7338.274s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything's the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7339.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so I know that the previous owner,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7342.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: did a very good job in that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7344.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that both the liquor store and really kept that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7347.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's one of the areas that we, that kept a clean out front with the scratch tickets and the nips, that's been a big bone of contention in the area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7357.264s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I hope you'd maintain that same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7359.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We will maintain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7360.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, we appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7361.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I see everything in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7364.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, I move approval pending any questions from my council partners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9209.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President, to be just if we can call these representatives from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9215.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These fields, I think that there's some questions that were brought up tonight that we really need to get some clarification as city councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9222.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then the other piece is also the fleet, dealing with the fleet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9227.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that there's a few trucks down right now, and we do have a Boston City truck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9231.963s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People have been asking me, why do we have a Boston City truck?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9234.584s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've talked to a few firefighters and they explained, so there's reasons for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9238.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it'd be nice if we get a report dealing with this with all the parties involved, meaning<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9245.571s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, city administration, the HR director and representative for the fight upon but that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9251.794s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if I could call for that make a motion for next week, our next meeting to invite all those parties to be present the meeting, city regular city council meeting just to give us a brief update on what's going on to so we have an understanding but I don't see it happening but it's just a thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9269.221s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9299.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's distracting and devastating working in the municipality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9303.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What was said tonight, that you have to wait for the open enrollment, not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9307.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I could tell you that working firsthand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9311.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I do want all the parties in place so we can dispel any rumors and move forward to try to help our firefighters who don't have insurance, and at the same time, also ask for the representatives of the fire department here to tell us what we need to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9335.756s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what the whole idea is, to approve it and then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9363.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we change the wording, say we would like them to report back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9367.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, so if we can't, just... Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9371.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, sorry about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9625.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9625.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just, uh, informed just to share some information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9630.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9631.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, but the it is it is, uh, to the public that, um, as of January 24th that, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9641.142s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The 2023 annual census will be arriving in your mailboxes within next week, which means it should be arriving this week or next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9648.065s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So everybody should look out for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9650.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, just to reiterate, the importance of the census plays a lot to do with what funding we get here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9659.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's very important that people do their due diligence in making sure they fill out the census.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9665.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9668.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10142.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Since two weeks ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10149.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Take your time out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10151.518s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Zach's a judge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10153.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Ask Nicole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10384.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, not you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10394.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a resolution for next month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10395.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10399.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10686.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, no, we've got two papers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10692.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10715.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President, I know I got, I got a few phone calls and some pitches I can share with the council tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10722.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: of situation Harris Park where dogs are actually inside the basketball courts with the gates closed and people running around dogs running around and residents not being able to use those areas because there are dogs off leash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10737.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, we just got a report back one from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10742.47s">[Scarpelli]</a>: from the mayor's office I know they talked about this pilot program that they wanted to start if that was something that if that they've started that and we just weren't informed, and then if we can, especially in the Harris Park area, if we can have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10759.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the health department code enforcement officer, maybe, um, request them to check that area, um, for unleashed dogs, especially with that playground area, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10769.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So being so popular, I think it's important that we just look out for the safety of our Children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10774.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10979.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, before we leave, I know that Saturday morning is 30 below zero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10984.792s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If the mayor has any plan, the state administration has any plan for any emergency hotline or anything, if people need emergency care with this dangerous situation, that that be posted somewhere and maybe put on her Facebook site so we can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=11003.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we can know what plans we have in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=11005.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, everybody take care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=11007.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, the report says it's 30 below with windchill on Saturday morning, so be careful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=11013.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=11016.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, just a motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=2505.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Before you move the screen and change the screen, I know that some of the neighbors, one of the questions they had were really when the business was closed, maybe there were racing cars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=2518.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we putting in speed bumps as race walks on the premises or in the lanes now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=2599.563s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=2600.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I know that talking to some of the residents, probably the worst time is during the spring and summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=2606.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: where I know they have the removable speed bumps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=2613.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Could that be possibly looked into for spring and summer months that we could put those down?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=2618.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that in the city, we've had areas with the temporary raised bumps to try to control the speeding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=2627.855s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, and I know we're not looking in this picture, it's not showing much of the back of the building on the Felsway side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=2634.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's good to see all the work being done at the front, but on the back, I know that in the past, I know when I used to work there, they used to have a gate that at the end of the evening, we used to close access to the back of the building when businesses closed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=2652.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: On the Felsworth side?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=2653.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: On the Felsworth side, years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4111.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4111.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, thank you for presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4114.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think you have been very thorough and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4118.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: answer our questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4119.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But most importantly, I think you realize most of these questions derived from the most important people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4125.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those are our butters and residents live around the area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4128.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, we appreciate that you acknowledge that 1986 and being the, you know, the first B. J. That opens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4136.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But, um, I'm sure you've heard from the neighbors that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4142.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it didn't show it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4143.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's what they were concerned with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4145.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, uh, this is good faith and movement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4147.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, um, it's important that they have a voice and they have someone they can talk to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4156.105s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, even if it is through the city in the code enforcement officer, let's say that has a contact number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4162.486s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's something that I wanted to make sure we had, and I appreciate that's in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4167.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And going the extra mile and giving that person's personal information I think shows the commitment that we haven't seen from BJ's for a long time with our neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4179.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So those pitches are pretty drastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4184.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, with the fencing and the garbage that went through onto Bradbury or Woodruff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4191.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that those are the concerns where you've addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4196.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think the trucks that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4200.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what frustrates you frustrates all of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4202.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's something that we as a council have to have a separate meeting with the traffic enforcement, the chief of police and make sure we do we do our job to make sure that that stops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4215.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4217.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4219.539s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You made<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4220.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: not just some half remarks saying that you'll try, but you're committed to a lot of these, even with the speed bumps, something that being creative and looking at seven months out of the year, that we can definitely stop that process of speeding down those lanes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4236.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that is exactly what I was looking for tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4239.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate the effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4241.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4241.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5248.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, I think that the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5251.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council for the neighbors makes a point that I think that we addressed with the representative of BJ's that holds the restrictions to the permits that we have that meeting once a year to make sure that we follow through with these these these concerns in the neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5269.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I think that the representative for BJ's weren't there in 1986, I would take.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5275.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But you would also understand the neighbors that see what they're living in right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5281.47s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what they were living in before the permit request came before us about building this gas station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5289.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you can understand the frustration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5291.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think all of you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5293.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that it would be disingenuine<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5297.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that if it's not followed through, and I hope you meant your word, and we have the restrictions in place to make sure that if we follow through and vote in favor of this tonight, that our neighbors will have a voice from here on out, and that area, their neighborhood, will be represented by someone from BJ's on a phone call basis, so I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5320.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5321.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want to clarify that with the neighbors, some that are very close to me, that I grew up with, that had the same concerns or proud of us at the same time that we voted no, then understanding the process that we went through that evening that caused this to go to a legal format and this be heard in front of a judge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5341.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think it's important that people realize<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5347.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The biggest issue for this council was not having legal representation in that room that evening that brought us to this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5355.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that it's important that we still hold the administration accountable for this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5366.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We do not claim to be attorneys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5368.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We do not claim to have all of our rules and regulations memorized on the tip of our tongues, but at the same time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5376.78s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we didn't have support that we needed to make this council work for the people that we should have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5382.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I want people in the public to realize that, especially our neighbors that live in the Wellington area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5390.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something I regret and wish we could turn the clock back and have the city solicitor that we asked for for years in that room to support us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5400.209s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5402.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that does handcuff us in a sense, but at the same time, it also brought us to what I feel is a pretty reasonable and committed relationship with our partners at BJ.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5415.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8742.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, if you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8745.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Before we get started, I think that as we get these<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8750.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: these outlets from the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8754.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we should set precedent to make sure everybody understands before anybody speaks on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8760.579s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is done anyway, whether the council supports it or doesn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8764.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is just, I think, a platform for the administration just to speak on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8769.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that there isn't any discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8772.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's really just a platform for the mayor to tell everybody what she feels is important for the opera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8779.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have we gotten a report before we start this and what would where the opera money is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8785.313s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have we gotten any updates on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8791.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8791.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I, you know, I appreciate this coming forward and I'll make a resolution, put a resolution through as we move forward for next week that we get an update on where we are with the offer money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8804.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I just want the public to realize this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8806.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that we're going to have to vote on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8809.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that is just sharing with us and something she's moving forward, not to say it's bad or good, but it has no bearing with this council with any decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8819.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1302.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1303.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1306.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I too understand the concept behind it, because we all get the phone calls from the people that didn't know, and I think a lot has to do with the transparency and the communication from the administration's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1318.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's where we're lacking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1320.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I work in a community that the streets get swept every Tuesday, so having those signs up are important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1330.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: even that, being a member of the community there, you still hear people complain because they got towed or because, you know, one thing or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1340.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we had an infrastructure in place here that had the times and locations all set, and we know, I mean, imagine even getting the notification today, you know, what process they have today for the twice a year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1359.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it starts one day, then all of a sudden it's another day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1362.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So and then changing those on a sign that would be monumental.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1366.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that I also agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1368.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I got a phone call from one constituent that reminded me over an issue in their neighborhood when they putting up, um, they're putting up crossing, you know, crossing sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1379.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They were upset because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1381.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What is Councilor Cabrera assigned pollution?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1383.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, it just looks messy when we're trying to clean the streets up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1389.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I personally think, I don't disagree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1393.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just think there has to be a process from the administration that really spreads the word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1401.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that, what is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1403.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've heard that there's a new website unveiling soon<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1408.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: probably 2025, I'm not sure, but as soon as they get an IT department, they're putting together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1416.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a new site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1417.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, that's the first step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1418.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, um, you know, something simple as in the old days, they even coming down the street and putting, you know, notices on telephone poles, letting people know that they're coming the next day, having the police come down a little bit earlier, hitting the sirens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1434.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, there's got to be another way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1435.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what I would recommend is honestly calling for a subcommittee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1441.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we can actually you know whether it be signs with with myself or traffic that we can meet with all the parties involved and let's let's vet out a process that even right now what we could do immediately before the spring sweep and we so we can look at that process i think i don't disagree with council beers i i hear we get the same phone calls<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1462.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think there's so many other variables that would impact that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1465.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we're just way too early to look at the cost, the aesthetics of it, and the management of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1475.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know when we're going to do one thing or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1477.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that that's why I would, I wouldn't support it tonight, but I would support a meeting and bringing this forward to a subcommittee where we could bring all those parties that council is asking for together and say, Hey, this is the extreme in my eyes, but what can we do right now to make it work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1492.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1953.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: neighborhood communities that street sweep every day, their traffic and parking department, their fees and fines go directly to the streets, parks and school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1962.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's what that money is used for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1965.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then you see the action, the reaction of their constituents are pretty pleased when they realize, okay, I messed up, I got a parking ticket, but if it's going to go back to the schools and the parks, it's worth it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1977.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not to new growth, but so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2248.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we could, for the record, could we ask the engineer for just a cost breakdown of what that was?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2254.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because it'd be interesting to see what that cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2827.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2828.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, maybe the wording is a little off, but the intent for this resolution isn't really to discuss what has been unveiled to date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2838.953s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's really too early to see the benefits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2843.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we hear a lot of great things from the students I've talked to that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2849.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: immediately they felt safer, immediately they appreciated the structure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2853.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They still, the administration had assemblies with all the kids so they can explain what the process is and what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2863.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that was very helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2864.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we saw a lot of very good movement, but I think that this resolution is really for this council as we move toward the budget season, where the biggest department<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2878.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in this community that takes up most of this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2882.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our city budget is a school department and also understanding the shortfalls that are being mentioned in public arenas from our city administration, how bad the budget is going to look this coming year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2897.953s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's important that we meet with the mayor, the superintendent and the school committee as they start to put<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2905.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: their budget together and the understanding where the questions that came about during these concerns and these issues, safety issues, that we're making sure that we're in full support funding-wise when it comes to security processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2924.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the implementation or any maintenance that needs to be done on cameras, the understanding of any processes going through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2934.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If the SRO is that they hired, I hear great feedback from the kids that they feel safer because of that and understanding that process and making sure that's funded in the police budget or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2951.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the school budget or the city budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2953.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So a lot of this for this resolution really was meant for setting up that meeting because I believe um someone on the school committee mentioned that this council has never asked for that and and they've never seen us there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2968.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that I'm reaching the olive branch to say let's find find a time to all meet<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2976.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and so that we're all on the same page when it comes to this budget for this serious concern and serious issues that we witnessed this past couple of months that we need to make sure that we are on top of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2989.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can, I just hope my fellow councilors, I would make the motion, like I said, that we really, that council president reach out to the mayor's administration and call the superintendency, what we can do to get a meeting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3005.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, relatively soon, I mean, we did get some, we will be getting some paperwork, I believe, financial paperwork.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3012.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it all of it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3013.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it was just one, one month, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3015.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we still don't know or understand the pattern of our fiscal climate right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3022.796s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's still unknown to us, but at least we can sit down and understand the process that I know that when I was on the school committee, the process was very clear and it was very open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3035.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We understood what we were looking for as a school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3039.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And like I talked to a few councils earlier, it was very simple that we looked right away as what we were making sure we're maintaining any legal obligations to any programs that were running in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3052.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and making sure that we had coverage with that, with those programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3056.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we listened to every principal to make sure that all the needs were met in each school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3062.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm sure they do that now, but I think it'll be important for us to understand that process and for us to express support for the budget that they're looking for, the school department's looking for as a partner to make sure that we're all on the same page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3082.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This was a very difficult situation that divided our bodies, not everybody, but some people in each body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3091.051s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can only imagine what's going to happen when the budget comes out and they tell the school department that they have to cut another $2.3 million per se.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3100.316s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a fictitious number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3101.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not a real number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3103.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm saying, fictitiously, if that happened, where would we be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3107.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't want, I wanna make sure that we're on the same page and proactive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3111.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's first of January right now, before we really unveil this and we still get into the nitty gritty of the budget, we really need to hold a meeting with those stakeholders to make sure that we're all on the same page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3123.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3164.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, that'd be that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3166.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the intent and that encompasses everything we need to talk about will bring up the safety concerns as part of their budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3173.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As long as you know, if you could put if we could put something in there, not only with December, was it December 20th?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3179.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, we talked about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3180.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3180.661s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so I take that back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3182.221s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I forgot that date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3182.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So no, that would be that would work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3185.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3193.888s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can get mine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3194.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I gave you mine in three seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3430.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3431.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, Mr. Bradnese passed, I believe, before Christmas, and we haven't had an opportunity to bring this resolution forward, so that's why it's a little late, and I apologize to the Bradnese family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3446.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Bradnese was one of those families that led one of those families in Medford that were stalwarts of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3457.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a U. S. Navy veteran.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3459.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, a longtime method resident, a method firefighter for over 30 years, and, um, he passed away peacefully before Christmas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3469.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, um, I just wanted to reach out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3472.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: His son, Mark and I graduated together at Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3476.913s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, he had a wonderful family, wonderful wife, and, uh, he'll be missed in our community and especially the tap street area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3485.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3486.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, you should get special dispensation for living on that hill anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3490.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, so I know that, um, uh, he's definitely a loss and I would, uh, ask the, um, the clerk to send out, um, um, uh, memo to the family, just letting them know that if we could honor them by, uh, holding this meeting in his name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3510.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, and hold the moment of silence from Mr. Brand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3513.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3514.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3570.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I caught a little heat after inviting the football team and congratulating them for their community service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3575.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had a few other champions that I'd like to call on for our next meeting, Mr. Clerk, Madam President, so we can give them a citation and congratulate them on a job well done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3587.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was our 2022 Girls Varsity Soccer GBL champions and our champion Anna Casey from our cross country team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3597.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3600.65s">[Scarpelli]</a>: put out an invite, contact Athletic Director Maloney, and have young ladies come out and acknowledge their accomplishments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3613.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5624.663s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, just to just answer this in my background, what we've done in Somerville, you use this different forms of coconut husks and wood chips.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5632.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's it's environmentally safe and it's a better option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5637.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The old Nike black pellets that were poured in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5640.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So just to share that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5642.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5745.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5747.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5749.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Janine, thank you very much because I think that when you talk about your position, I work very closely with our department and we're fortunate in my community that I work in that we have a whole planning parks division and engineers and designers that are looking into these processes and moving that step forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5769.051s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that, you know, you've given your time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5771.331s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was very impressive and I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5775.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: being the phys ed teacher that started at the McGlynn, this was awful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5783.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This site was tough because you couldn't do much other than<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5787.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: kids bouncing around when it first came out, then the bounce is gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5790.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that it's great to see what we have and we definitely need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5795.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that it's so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5796.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, you know, a couple of, you know, as we went through the processes in the community we work in, just be careful of the lower nets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5805.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it sounds great, but you can start it today and then tomorrow the high school and neighboring older kids come by and they want to do a dunk contest, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5816.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's something that we should be aware of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5817.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, that's going to be the preventive maintenance side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5819.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think my concern right now is now if this is all from ARPA, if this is all going to be funded through ARPA, this is great because it's the mayor's decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5828.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This council really has no leverage or any<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5833.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: word to share with that's all coming from the main office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5836.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's great for the presentation is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5838.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's we appreciate that the information, but I, you know, the, I want you to understand as a parent and a volunteer that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5847.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're in a position right now that, I'm sure you've heard it possibly, but we haven't seen a money paper in the city in years, it seems like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5855.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we don't know what's gonna happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5858.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we hear the mayor has gone to different library groups or whatnot and said that the budget's gonna be really dire coming up, it frightens me that here we are, you put all this work into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5869.526s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you've come to us and we're talking about a $2.6 million project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5873.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And in theory, it sounds phenomenal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5875.29s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if it was going to be funded all from ARPA, there we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5877.512s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5877.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5879.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's the mayor's decision, the committee that she has on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5882.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want to be upfront and understanding that without seeing the budget right now, it's tough for this council that if we get started and the organization comes back to us, it's not the fact that we don't need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5895.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not the fact that it's probably going to be one of the best parks that are probably going to be utilized from every neighbor and community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5900.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I tell you, when we opened up ours at the Lincoln School, people came over from, I'm telling you, from miles away to be part of the parkour park there and everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5911.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's definitely something we want and we need in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5915.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that as we move forward, we need to really have everybody understand<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5919.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the restrictions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5920.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're in this council right now is really not understanding where we fall on the budget because we're talking early.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5925.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's why I requested the meeting with the school committee, the mayor and the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5929.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5930.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as we get the process going, I would hate to see something that we get to the point in May and say, Hey, we're moving, moving forward with this great project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5937.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now we're going to have to tail back because we're looking at cutting teachers and we're looking at cutting safety issues at the high school, but we're looking cutting for security.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5945.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is why I'm calling for that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5948.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I hope, you know, spread that word to support that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5951.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But because I think this is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5953.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5954.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is where my kids went.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5956.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is where I taught.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5957.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A lot of my colleagues are still there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5959.868s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know how important it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5961.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to see that plan, that's amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5964.274s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that it's so exciting to see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5967.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The whole community is going to use it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5970.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can't imagine<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5973.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what not only the school community is going to use, what the recreation department can use, just with that stage in that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5979.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, talk about a community event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5981.459s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, everybody's just, you know, you talk about the Shell, and that's a great place, but a lot of people are afraid of the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5988.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But now you're putting it into a park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5991.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm giddy just to think about the possibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=5994.231s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I just don't want to be the bearer of bad news or the, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=6000.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Debbie Downer, but I just want to make sure that we know that budgetary wise with this breakdown that you showed us, it's a.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=6008.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it was all ARPA and the mayor supporting that, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=6037.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like I said, you've done so much work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=6039.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=6069.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate, I just wanted to share that just in case, you know, we're here again in six months, like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=6075.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: my goodness, this didn't work through and how we're going to make it work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=6077.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=6079.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=6079.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And thank you again, because especially when you talk about volunteers, this is something we all talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=6085.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you talk about creative and educated members of our community that want to give back, this is the end result.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=6091.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=6092.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=114.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=116.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, it's my privilege tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=118.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we've had, um, we've had a tough week here in Medford, and, um, this is fitting and needed, uh, to address a group of young people that have done our city proud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=134.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, and before I recognize anyone, if Coach Curley and coach offered, come on up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=156.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just called them up just because next to coach Curly, I looked like a supermodel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=162.261s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I wanted to make sure he was next to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=165.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But you guys, I wanted to really put a resolution through a few weeks back to acknowledge what the Method Mustang football team has done and their coaching staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=180.575s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something that's always overlooked<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=184.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is the impact that young people play in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=188.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's easy when it's something bad, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=190.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When it's something bad, everybody wants to talk about what the kids are doing wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=195.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I wanted to make sure that as I look through different messages that I received, I was noticing a trend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=206.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was noticing an amazing trend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=211.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that our football team is a special, special group of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=216.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I coached at Medford High School for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=219.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was lucky to be part of a great organization and a great team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=224.417s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one thing I realized, it's very important to have Mustang pride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=229.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's what we're lacking right now in the city, true Mustang pride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=234.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when coach Curley came, came to the program and before that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=240.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had some difficulties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=241.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Numbers were low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=242.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Kids were getting in trouble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=244.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, we weren't winning games.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=246.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody thought that the world was ending.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=249.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then you saw the bigger picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=251.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Coach Curley came in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=253.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You saw him active in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=256.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You saw him doing special things with his team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=260.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And all of a sudden the football team started becoming, became elevated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=265.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now the numbers have grown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=269.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and positive things are in front of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=274.274s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=275.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's my favorite song, by the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=277.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=277.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now, what I wanted to address is something very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=284.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What is a Mustang?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=287.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not a word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=288.64s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know people, it's easy to say Mustang pride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=292.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What it means to be a Mustang is truly to love the city you live in, to represent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=298.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: your community with pride and distinction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=301.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what you boys and girls have done have been amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=314.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's the key, having a leader you can lean on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=317.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A person that wants to be involved in a young person's life, no matter what the circumstance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=325.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's easy to say when things aren't going well and teams aren't winning and you're losing, it's easy to say, well, they're no good, let's get rid of the coach and let's start all over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=336.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I find so impressive and I want you to understand, this isn't about winning and losing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=341.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You went to Fenway Park and you represented Medford with a lot of respect and pride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=349.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why I put this resolution through is for what you're doing off the field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=356.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A few things that this football team has done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=359.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've helped organize the national night out with the whole football team and the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=366.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Really showing what unity means and how everybody works together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=370.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You led that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=371.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In September, you helped empty out the senior citizens' basements and helped seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=378.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In October, you helped with the Unified Basketball League.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=383.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The day before Thanksgiving,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=385.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Before Thanksgiving game, we saw you guys over at McDonald Stadium helping with the unified flag football game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=393.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then you saw a bunch of football players in yards raking out people's yards that couldn't do it themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=400.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now you're helping with the Medford Family Network for their toy drive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=410.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I wanted to have this opportunity tonight to bring Coach Curley up and really commend you for what you have done and really put you on the pedestal that you deserve to be put on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=426.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One thing is having the leader to show you the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=430.223s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's an honor that I talked about John Curley tonight because John's a very special person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=435.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'd love to hear is I got a phone call from a teacher<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=439.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they said, George, I saw this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=441.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I need to share something with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=443.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had a problem with the football player.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=445.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was being a little wise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=448.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I called Coach Curley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=451.177s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the next day, Coach Curley was sitting in the back of the room, just his presence there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=458.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we realized is that young man wasn't offended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=463.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was so taken back that Coach Curley was there to do what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=468.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To show him he cares.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=469.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to make sure that he's doing the right thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=473.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's the type of leadership we need in our school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=475.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what you boys have done and girls have done and gone out to the community and put together all of these community service hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=481.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's something we should as a city applaud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=486.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I want to publicly thank you guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=488.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want we I know we put together a do we do we have that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=514.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so we have accommodations that we put together the method Mustang City Council, the method City Council award the this combination to and we'll say the young man's name a young lady's name and recognition of your outstanding 2022 season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=530.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with the Medford High School football team and your commitment to community service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=534.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Congratulations on your accomplishments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=536.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Go Mustangs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=537.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can, I'd love just to recognize you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=539.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to call your name up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=541.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that Coach Curley, Coach Offer are going to help out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=545.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can, just before we get going, if Coach Curley has anything to say, I know that before we get going, I know we want to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=551.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know some of the boys and girls want to get in and out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=553.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that, Coach, if you have anything to say, that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=616.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to figure one person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=627.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that Mr. Mr. Medford's here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=630.264s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, Mr. Chris Murphy, thank you for everything you do with the football association.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=634.666s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=636.477s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=637.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You look fabulous by the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=638.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=640.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, coach, you ready?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=641.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=650.621s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Louise Barbosa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=653.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, come on up if you're called.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=655.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=656.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So come on all the way around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=939.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Coach, I know that we have a bunch of coaches that have been committed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=942.794s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that they've been great with the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=945.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you could just acknowledge them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=946.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know, Coach Offit, you're a right-hand man, but anyone else that you need to address, that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=967.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you know when you're a true method program, when coach Joe's leading you boys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=971.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that I appreciate coach for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=974.474s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know he's at an appointment, but he's gonna try to make it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=977.716s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If not, I'll come by the house myself and drop off his.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=980.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what we did is we put together a certificate that's gonna be in a folder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=987.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna be getting that out to you tomorrow, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=989.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I thank you guys for coming out tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=992.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One more, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1001.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, it's easy to point things out when a young person does something wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1008.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It seems like that's an easy thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1010.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'm proud of tonight is that we're really putting you on a pedestal because you deserve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1017.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The opportunity that the time that you give on your own, like coach said that when we talked and said that no one forces you to do anything, but you go out and do it because you love the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1028.331s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what true community is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1030.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm proud of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1031.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1032.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My fellow Councilors, thank you and have a great night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1034.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1035.719s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1576.293s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1578.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is the anybody representing the city to answer any questions on this call?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1604.005s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the first time we've received this type of request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1625.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, so structurally, it's not unsafe or it's not going to jeopardize the area around the well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1633.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not, it's pretty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1637.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1638.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you're recommending this zone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1640.223s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is this something you recommend?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1641.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1642.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1775.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1777.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is the petitioner here this evening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1780.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hi, how are you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1783.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I've reviewed the paperwork.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1787.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything seems in order, sirs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1789.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what type of, if you could just give us just a brief synopsis to share with everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1832.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just me and my wife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1833.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1835.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1837.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I hear great things about this this product and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1840.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're excited that you're moving to Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1842.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a great location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1844.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that my daughter loves it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1846.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's going to be, it's going to be something we'll see in our family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1850.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I see everything in order, Madam President, I would move approval after questions from my fellow Councilors, if they have any.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3301.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3303.115s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Penny, for all your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3304.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've done so much for our community and I really appreciate everything you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3311.099s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3312.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One thing I realized as I'm reading through this, this is, it's amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3315.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what we've lacked here for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3318.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate your effort, but a most vulnerable community right now, have we, I didn't see anything with the housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3325.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we partnering anything with the Medford Housing Department to reach those families that I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3348.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So obviously, there'll be a big piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3350.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, definitely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4264.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What precisely are you looking for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4269.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, literally, after a year and a half of waiting for this document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4300.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Warren articles are passed by this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4317.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I'd like to clear this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4319.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want to give this body everything that it wants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4322.65s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I really do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4324.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, I came here<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4326.574s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have the budget tactuals for the first quarter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4329.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have revenue projections that unfortunately are locked up in my computer, which died.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4337.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I can email all that stuff to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4339.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I really don't wanna sit here and there's no reason for me not to give you stuff that you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4348.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just, okay, and we're on the same page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4351.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We really are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4352.91s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not really sure physically what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4356.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Warren articles are passed by this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4359.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4360.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've never voted on them once, ever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4401.839s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4405.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you're talking about the AP warrant, that's what you want to see, which all the bills that get paid every week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4416.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, how many years do you want that for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4420.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can stop there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4450.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand your frustration and I will work with the mayor to get this documentation to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4458.466s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if there's a holdup,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4460.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My issue with this whole thing is procedural.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4463.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I need to know exactly what you need to see when you need to see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4466.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm not completely clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4561.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4563.304s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And part of this is me being new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4567.487s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not coordinating with the mayor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4616.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4617.888s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It would simply be these, these are the vendors who are paid this warrant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4622.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I mean, we can also send you an example of what the previous finance or finance director gave us for specific bills would have to be looked up if you wanted to see a specific bill, but it will say, you know, we paid Joe Schmo $600.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4637.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4664.051s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What are one budget to actual with the votes that you took on the 28th for the general fund and water sewer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4672.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I have first quarter revenue compared to first quarter revenue from fiscal 2022.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4679.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4681.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's stuck in my computer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4683.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can email these files to you if you prefer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4686.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I do have paper copies of this along with the budget stuff along with the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4692.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to a copy of the vote that was taken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4749.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, well, I apologize that I haven't acted on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4754.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will follow up with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4759.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4760.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Bob, again, the other person taking the heat and I apologize for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4767.613s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not fair to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4771.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, no, and I'm not going to pile on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4773.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we should, you know, I think for preparations purposes, I think that maybe calling for a committee of the whole meeting with Bob, once we have all this information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4786.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: so we can sit down and really sink our teeth into these issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4790.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that, so you understand Bob, something as simplistic as people that are watching understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4797.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I was 14, I opened up a checking account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4799.716s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My dad said, okay, this is how you balance your checkbook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4803.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is how you spend your money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4805.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if you don't have, if you have $100 in your account and you want to purchase something for $120, it's telling you you can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4814.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and you're responsible to control your own finance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4817.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, what we're seeing time after time here, we're getting papers from the mayor, we're getting requests from different Councilors about asking for money papers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4828.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to be honest, I haven't voted for a financial paper and approval in a long time, because I find it very difficult for this body to do their job, not understanding the basic<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4840.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: financial breakdowns of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4842.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You were there when we had the tough budget process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4845.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was horrifying for you being new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4847.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as we're going through this process, but we haven't gotten one, one paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4852.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't gotten any information about where we're spending our money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4856.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here we are, we've got almost January, January one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4860.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I want the public to know this is the hardship we're feeling the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4867.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4868.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm trying to ask questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4870.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: about legal matters and we don't have anybody to turn to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4874.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I apologize that you have to be here tonight and really be hung out to dry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4879.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm curious if the chief of staff is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4915.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's a simple question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4917.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the chief of staff has been out for legitimate reasons and she hasn't, she just started to ramp back up, but were you familiar that our finance director hasn't received any of this information from this council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5030.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have crises that we're dealing with right now that we're looking at financial support and hoping for some financial support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5037.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we don't know where we are financially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5043.051s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to move forward with any of these dog and pony requests and then ask for funding for deeply needed resolves and not having an understanding of where we are financially,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5060.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is very difficult for me as a Councilor to make decisions moving the city forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5068.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope everybody that's watching and understands realizes how dysfunctional this community looks right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5080.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many issues that we're seeing that coming across from us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5084.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is so totally embarrassing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5086.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm disheartened right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5088.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So Bob, again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5090.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I apologize for the answer that the chief of staff just gave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5094.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The understanding is this, we have been asking for money papers, I think, I believe from the day after we had our budget, and we've been trying to get some information, some valuable information of where we're going, what direction we're in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5107.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're trying to figure out what, tonight's a very important meeting, there's some resolutions tonight, we're talking about some very important issues, and looking to fund some very important issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5116.609s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But getting the okay from the administration<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5119.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to fund papers, and then not understanding where we are, because I believe you were there when the mayor said, as critical as last year's budget was, next year's is gonna be even worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5131.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what puts me on edge right now, Bob, is the fact that we haven't seen anything, and we can't move to support our most neediest members of our community and resolutions that are coming forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5143.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I find this very disheartening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5146.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I find this very troubling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5148.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't know how my 16, 17 year old daughter has the ability to run her finances better than what we're seeing with this multimillion dollar corporation called Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5165.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and again, I know it's not you Bob, but I have to express my concerns and discuss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5171.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5172.705s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilors at some point it is going to be me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5175.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm just to let you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5178.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have had staffing issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5179.969s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Tina's been out, Tyler quit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5182.231s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've got a very, very good person to take over from Tyler.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5185.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She is already working on the 2024 budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5190.717s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've already had meetings on it with all the department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5196.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're working on that right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5199.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We got the recap done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5201.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm working on the state reporting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5203.107s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we'll know what pre-cash will be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5204.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hopefully we'll have that wrapped up within the next month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5207.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: depending on how much availability they have, they have staffing issues too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5211.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We were fortunate to get the recap done so quickly because there are people out there too and everybody does their recap at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5220.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's coming along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5226.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: By the end of December, I should, I can do the cash recon for the first half of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5233.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: fiscal 2023, which we can send off to CLA and get our revenue replacement number from ARPA for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5241.827s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You also have a much better projection of how much, you know, how much revenue we are actually going to take in in 2023.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5249.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we are working on all these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5251.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm doing a lot of cleanup work, especially on all the grant fundings and the CPC, the linkage funds, all of that stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5262.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm just trying to get the books back in order to be in a firm foundation from what I'm being able to say, this is what's actually going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5272.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry for the miscommunications or lack of communications, but we are seriously working on this stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5279.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't wanna be here till two in the morning on June 28th, hashing out a budget, neither do you guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5358.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please, I think until we have all the information in front of us and Bob has time now to get the documentation that we need to move this forward or to understand it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5369.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we need it immediately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5371.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's something that, you know, we've been asking for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5376.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: forever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5477.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5477.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5477.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5480.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5480.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5499.719s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President, appreciate taking this out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5504.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This has been a very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5507.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: emotional last 24 hours, it's been very intense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5512.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I wanted to make sure that if you allow me to give a small presentation that I prepared, so I don't miss anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5524.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Methods in crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5527.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not a new crisis, but one that has started to spiral out of control and has just caught the attention of the outside world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5536.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sadly, we had many years of warning given to us to prevent the latest incident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5543.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as we see today, those warning signs were ignored by the very people that were entrusted to protect our kids by acting on our behalf.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5553.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Most of you know my background as a former coach, teacher, and now Assistant Director of Recreation for Neighborhood Community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5563.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want to look at a few fundamentals to see where we missed out, where we made our mistakes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5570.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First thing that came to me is, are our kids safe?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5574.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, they're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5579.186s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not the data that we need now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5581.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We now have the actual proof from our experiences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5585.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we doing all that we can to keep our kids safe so they can learn and grow successfully?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5590.756s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5591.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The warning signs are there and we ignored it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5596.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we unified on this issue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5599.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Absolutely not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5601.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sadly, some people take their responsibility serious while others do not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5607.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I question the personal motives of some to simply protect their income versus protecting people that got them elected or hired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5622.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are outside groups currently bullying elected officials to exercise their views, which do not help to protect our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5631.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: National organizations, national movements, while we're having crisis here in our own backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5639.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is our division hurting our kids and the reputation of our city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5644.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, that's evident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5646.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The division in this great community is tragic<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5651.424s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it continues, we'll just see the first of many situations that will bring our amazing city even further down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5659.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, two heads are better than one, and four heads are better than two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5664.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unified, we will overcome together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5667.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Divided, we will continue the sad, turbulent ride to a much worse place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5683.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My knee-jerk reaction was quickly defended to the categorization of being looked at and politicizing this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5693.929s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then I thought about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5695.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Of course I'm politicizing this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5698.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because that's the only way, the only mechanism that we, our kids, and the citizens have to make any changes to our system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5707.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We live in a political system that requires checks and balances to protect our citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5713.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So being attacked with this term makes no sense and showed me exactly how those that are guilty continue to deflect away from their own inaction, neglect, and responsibilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5728.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, we've learned that inaction equals action, meaning inaction enabled these outcomes, putting our kids in harm's way and making our parents petrified to send our kids to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5743.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the atrocity that we are looking at today, right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5751.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If anyone has been politicizing this issue, it's those that have been both enabling these outcomes and hiding from the consequences of their own inactions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5762.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We were elected by the people, for the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5765.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's time that we get to work for the people, especially our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5772.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: See, when<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5773.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We got elected by the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5776.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It should not be measured by winning or losing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5780.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It should be measured by the impact that we make and promises that we keep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5787.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is our opportunity that has presented itself to us today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5792.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The question was presented, what are we going to do about it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5798.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Here's what I propose to get us united, back on track and protect our kids<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5803.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the way that they require from us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5808.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First, I'm going to be asking the mayor to put together a team so we can put an implementation of safety that works with our teachers, our principals, our police department, so our kids feel safe when they go back on January 3rd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5832.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We want them to feel safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5835.663s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Meetings, consultants, that's passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5840.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have true professionals in our building that we can work together over the next two weeks to make sure we have that plan in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5846.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sure of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5850.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have resolutions in place this evening that would ask the mayor to prepare an RFP to hire and train true security guards, four to five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5862.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Make sure that we have full staffing in the video room where our staff can watch a minute to minute action and who's going into the bathrooms, who's loitering in the hallways to make sure our administration can see where these issues are happening and get<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5879.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the support there as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5882.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Last night, I believe it was Tony Puccio who brought up a very simple resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5889.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We ask our parents today to do everything, to be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5894.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he mentioned that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5896.11s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I thought that was a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5897.191s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I got home, I got a phone call from a former soccer captain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5900.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She went to school in Tulane, worked in Louisiana, and she sent me an article about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5906.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a program they use in the schools in Louisiana where they were having issues and concerns like we're having today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5912.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's called Dads in the Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5914.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe, to be correct, we'll call it Dads and Moms in the Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5918.539s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we could put parents on a bus to go to a field trip to Plymouth Rock, then we could put parents in the school that want to assist our teachers to make sure they're just an extra eyes and ears as we walk the halls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5930.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I thank you, Mr. Puccio, for bringing that forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5933.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm going to ask the school committee to open up their meetings for public participation, where there's a dialogue like last evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5943.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if there's an issue with parents, students, or constituents, they have this forum to come and speak with a dialogue back and forth to make sure things are identified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5955.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The process that's in place right now, as some parents can tell you tonight, very daunting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5961.148s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to put it through, to ask to get approval, to read something, to write something up and making sure that what is going to be presented is approved is another form of censorship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5975.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If not, I'm gonna request this council to go back to the original request that Councilor Knight and I put forth as a ordinance change demanding that we put in place that format for the City School Committee so they have an avenue<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5990.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to have a voice and they can listen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6012.088s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The word back was that the police were there and they were present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6016.01s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we also know that won't happen every single day for the rest of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6021.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I implore our school committee to work together with the police department to move forward to making sure that there's a plan in place over the next few weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6034.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have our children feeling safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6047.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that she's not here right now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6050.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I want, I heard something last night from a very courageous young lady and I want to leave with something that she said that I take it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6057.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was directed to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6058.868s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's direct to all of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6060.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was very simple to, as she said, step up a step down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6071.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a responsibility to make sure that we're giving the tools to our leaders in the school, our principals and assistant principals, to make sure that they can run the schools as efficient as they did when they led the middle schools or before this administration, when they were part of the resolutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6093.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So let's unify this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6095.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's unify our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6098.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and let's make Medford the city that it's always been, an amazing place to live, work, and raise their family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6107.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7656.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information, if I can, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7661.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the funding was there for the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7664.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe it was probably 80% of the funding that was cut for security over the last four years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7670.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the funding was there and the school system cut that funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7674.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8153.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: trying to be restrained and understanding something very simple that I want to share with my fellow Councilors that gave their opinions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8181.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to talk about money concerns and money issues should not be even a thought right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8189.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The thought and the discussion of 30 years ago, five years ago, is an embarrassment to me for the fact that this is happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8199.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is happening right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8204.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I talk about unifying, I talk about what I said as a national agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8212.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we see and hear the direction that the school committee has gone on many different levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8221.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And some school committees, members have called me in the past and just didn't understand that they wouldn't fight if they didn't have their own voice, but to follow this national agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8235.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as I'm seeing,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8236.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the people that I looked at and trusted and admired, I'm seeing that they're taking not what's important today in our schools, not what's important, our children, not their safety, but to be in this council chamber yesterday and listen to some of these people that truly are aligned with people in this room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8267.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we need to put that away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8271.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Open our minds and be unified in the fact that the unification is needed for the safety of our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8278.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not what happened five years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8280.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not what happened 30 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8283.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What's happening today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8284.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not gonna get the funding we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8287.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8288.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's not gonna change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8290.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So bringing that up right now is really sad to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8295.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's just a buzzword and a check off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8299.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will tell you, we need movement now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8304.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need our school committee, our superintendent to move now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8309.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wanna see action now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8314.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's stop, let's hold school off for the next four days, three days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8317.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's bring our teachers into a room with our principals and let's find a solution right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8323.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So our kids are safe when it's time to go back to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8334.474s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want to get solutions from groups that are going to work together to make our kids safe on January 3rd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8342.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Safe when they go back to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8346.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to protect each other because what was said in another forum and how it was presented by this Councilor to people on different committees and try to protect what they're doing on the school committee side, I'm not afraid to speak for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8387.609s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I understood those legalities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8390.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8391.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When it came to children's safety, George Scarpelli never swayed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8395.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I made sure that they were safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8398.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I never had this situation when I was on the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8401.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank God.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8404.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you, we can bicker back and forth and disagree, but ultimately, that wasn't my intention today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8413.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My intention is truly look at everybody and say, let's meet now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8418.33s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's bring everybody together now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8420.231s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's set a plan that's tangible that we can reach, that we're not gonna get grants from the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8425.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not gonna get funding from City Hall, but there's ways to get that done right now to make our children feel safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8434.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9474.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9475.494s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a difference between bullying and passion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9478.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what you lack, ma'am.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9479.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You lack the passion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9535.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9538.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam Superintendent, yesterday a young man came to the podium and addressed the situation that happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9546.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you hear the young man who described a very similar situation just a few weeks prior?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9552.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I asked the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9557.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Was that addressed today?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9558.459s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you contact the guidance Councilor that he talked to, to express the concern of the same people threatening him to stab him?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9568.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you address that today?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10080.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not isolated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10084.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Would it be shocking, Madam Superintendent, that a few phone calls I did receive from personnel that were there to support that there were still numerous students walking the halls freely?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10100.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Has that even been addressed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10142.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As you approach the re-entry and starting the new year off, I would really hope, from what I've heard from the kids, is that your administration, yourself personally, bring the student body together so they can understand what's going on because they're lost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10159.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Over the last incident that happened, they were waiting for some sort of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10164.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: acknowledgement of something and to keep them feeling safe, that was not done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10172.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope moving forward on the third, that the student body is in one area that they can see the leadership of our school system to show them that we're there and we understand what we're trying to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10186.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That hasn't been done yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14283.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry, maybe you didn't understand what I meant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14287.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was the fact that I wanted to bring it back to today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14291.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to focus on today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14293.78s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can't go back to 30 years right now and worry about this today because today is the crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=360.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=474.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=475.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's my privilege tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=477.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we've had a tough week here in Medford, and this is fitting and needed to address a group of young people that have done our city proud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=493.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And before I recognize anyone, if Coach Curley and Coach Offit come on up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=515.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just called them up just because next to coach curly, I looked like a supermodel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=521.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, I wanted, I wanted to make sure he was next to me, but you guys, uh, I wanted to really put a resolution through a few weeks back to acknowledge, um, what the method Mustang football team has done and their coaching staff, something that's always, always overlooked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=543.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is the impact that young people play in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=547.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's easy when it's something bad, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=549.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When it's something bad, everybody wants to talk about what the kids are doing wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=554.221s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I wanted to make sure that as I look through different messages that I received, I was noticing a trend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=565.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was noticing an amazing trend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=570.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that our football team is a special, special group of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=575.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I coached at Medford High School for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=577.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was lucky to be part of a great organization and a great team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=583.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one thing I realized, it's very important to have Mustang pride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=588.922s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's what we're lacking right now in the city, true Mustang pride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=593.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when coach Curley came, came to the program and before that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=599.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had some difficulties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=600.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Numbers were low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=601.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Kids were getting in trouble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=603.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, we weren't winning games.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=606.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody thought that the world was ending.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=608.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then you saw the bigger picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=610.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Coach Curly came in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=613.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You saw him active in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=616.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You saw him doing special things with his, his team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=619.945s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And all of a sudden the football team started becoming, became elevated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=625.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now the numbers have grown and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=629.264s">[Scarpelli]</a>: positive things are in front of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=633.407s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=634.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's my favorite song, by the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=636.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=637.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now, what I wanted to address is something very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=643.553s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What is a Mustang?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=646.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not a word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=647.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know people, it's easy to say Mustang pride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=651.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What it means to be a Mustang is truly to love the city you live in, to represent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=657.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: your community with pride and distinction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=660.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what you boys and girls have done have been amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=669.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One thing I will say is that we have Coach Curley as your leader.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=673.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's the key, having a leader you can lean on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=676.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A person that wants to be involved in a young person's life, no matter what the circumstance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=684.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's easy to say when things aren't going well and teams aren't winning and you're losing, it's easy to say, well, they're no good, let's get rid of the coach and let's start all over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=695.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I find so impressive and I want you to understand, this isn't about winning and losing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=700.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You went to Fenway Park and you represented Medford with a lot of respect and pride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=709.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why I put this resolution through is for what you're doing off the field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=715.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A few things that this football team has done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=718.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've helped organize the national night out with the whole football team and the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=725.264s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Really showing what unity means and how everybody works together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=729.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You led that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=731.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In September, you helped empty out the senior citizens' basements and helped seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=737.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In October, you helped with the Unified Basketball League.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=742.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The day before Thanksgiving,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=744.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Before Thanksgiving game, we saw you guys over at McDonald Stadium helping with the unified flag football game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=752.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then you saw a bunch of football players in yards raking out people's yards that couldn't do it themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=759.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now you're helping with the Medford Family Network for their toy drive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=766.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=769.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I wanted to have this opportunity tonight to bring Coach Curley up and really commend you for what you have done and really put you on the pedestal that you deserve to be put on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=785.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One thing is having the leader to show you the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=789.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's an honor that I talk about John Curley tonight because John's a very special person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=794.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I love to hear is I got a phone call from a teacher<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=798.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they said, George, I saw this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=800.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I need to share something with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=803.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had a problem with the football player.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=804.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was being a little wise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=807.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I called Coach Curley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=810.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the next day, Coach Curley was sitting in the back of the room, just his presence there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=817.695s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we realized is that young man wasn't offended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=822.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was so taken back that Coach Curley was there to do what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=827.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To show him he cares.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=828.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to make sure that he's doing the right thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=832.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's the type of leadership we need in our school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=835.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what you boys have done and girls have done and gone out to the community and put together all of these community service hours, it's something we should as a city applaud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=845.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I wanna publicly thank you guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=848.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we put together a, do we have that at?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=861.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so we have accommodations that we put together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=878.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the Muffet Mustang City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=880.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The Muffet City Council award the this combination to and we'll say the young man's name, a young lady's name in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=889.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with the Medford High School football team and your commitment to community service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=893.824s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Congratulations on your accomplishments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=895.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Go Mustangs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=897.107s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can, we'd love just to recognize you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=899.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to call your name up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=900.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that Coach Curley, Coach Offit are going to help out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=904.514s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can, just before we get going, if Coach Curley has anything to say, I know that before we get going, I know we want to, I know some of the boys and girls want to get in and out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=912.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that, Coach, if you have anything to say, that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=985.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to figure one person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=986.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that Mr. Mr. Medford's here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=989.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, Mr. Chris Murphy, thank you for everything you do with the football association.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=994.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, and we really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=996.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You look fabulous by the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=997.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=998.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, coach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=999.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You ready?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1001.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1012.666s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, come on up if you're called.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1014.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1015.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So come on all the way around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1296.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, uh, coach, I know that we have a bunch of coaches that have been committed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1301.928s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that, uh, they've been great with the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1304.429s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you could just acknowledge them, I know Coach Offit is your right hand man, but anyone else that, um, need to address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1326.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, when you're a true Medford program, when coach Joe's, uh, leading you boys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1330.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that I appreciate coach for being, being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1333.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know he's at, he's at an appointment, but he's going to try to make it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1336.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If not, I'll come by the house myself and drop off his.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1339.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, uh, what, what, what we did is we put together a certificate that's going to be, uh, in a folder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1346.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to be really, we're going to be getting that out to you tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1348.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1349.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I thank you guys for coming out tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1350.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1351.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1356.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Coach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1361.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, it's easy to point things out when a young person does something wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1367.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It seems like that's an easy thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1369.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'm proud of tonight is that we're really putting you on a pedestal because you deserve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1376.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The opportunity, the time that you give on your own, like Coach said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1380.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when we talked and said that no one forces you to do anything, but you go out and do it because you love the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1387.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what true community is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1389.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm proud of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1390.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1391.148s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My fellow Councilors, thank you and have a great night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1393.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1394.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1706.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1776.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1842.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1935.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, if I can, is the anybody representing the city to answer any questions on this call?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1963.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the first time we've received this type of request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1984.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, so structurally, it's not unsafe or it's not gonna jeopardize the area around the well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1992.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not, it's pretty, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1997.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you're recommending this, Owen, is this something you recommend?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2004.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2099.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2135.041s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2137.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is the petitioner here this evening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2139.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hi, how are you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2142.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I've reviewed the paperwork.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2146.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything seems in order, sirs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2148.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what type of, if you could just give us just a brief synopsis to share with everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2187.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2187.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2188.289s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Cause I was falling into play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2189.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then, uh, how many employees do you have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2194.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's it? Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2195.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, and I hear great things about this, this product and, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2199.514s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're excited that you're moving to Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2201.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a great location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2203.115s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that my daughter loves it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2205.695s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's gonna be something we'll see in our family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2209.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I see everything in order, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2212.417s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would move approval after questions from my fellow councilors, if they have any.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2266.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2272.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3660.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3662.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Penny, for all your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3663.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've done so much for our community and I really appreciate everything you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3670.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3671.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, one thing I realized as I'm reading through this, this is, it's amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3674.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is, this is what we've let we've lacked here for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3677.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate your effort, but, uh, a most vulnerable community right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3682.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have we, I didn't see anything with the housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3684.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we partnering anything with the, with the method housing department to reach, uh, those families that I think that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3691.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3707.544s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so obviously there'll be a big piece of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3709.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, definitely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5118.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5119.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Bob, again, the other person taking the heat, and I apologize for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5126.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not fair to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5130.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, no, and I'm not going to pile on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5132.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we should, you know, I think for preparations purposes, I think that maybe calling for a Committee of the Whole meeting with Bob once we have all this information<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5145.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: so we can sit down and really sink our teeth into these issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5149.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that, so you understand, Bob, you know, something as simplistic as people that are watching understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5156.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, when I was 14, I opened up a checking account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5158.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My dad said, okay, this is how you balance your checkbook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5162.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is how you spend your money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5164.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if you don't, if you don't have, if you have $100 in your account and you want to purchase something for $120, it's telling you you can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5172.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, you're responsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5175.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to control your own finance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5176.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, what was saying time after time here, we're getting papers from the mayor, we're getting requests from different Councilors about asking for money papers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5187.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to be honest, I haven't voted for a financial paper and approval in a long time, because I, I find it very difficult for this body to do their job, not understanding the basic<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5199.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: financial breakdowns of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5201.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You were there when we had the tough budget process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5204.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was horrifying for you being new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5206.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as we're going through this process, Bob, we haven't gotten one, one paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5212.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't gotten any information about where we're spending our money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5215.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here we are, God, almost January, January one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5219.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I want the public to know this is the hardship we're feeling in the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5226.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5227.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm trying to ask questions about legal matters and we don't have anybody to turn to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5233.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I apologize that you have to be here tonight and really be hung out to dry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5238.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm curious if the chief of staff is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5254.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, can we address the question to her?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5274.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's a simple question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5276.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the Chief of Staff has been out for legitimate reasons and she hasn't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5284.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She just started to ramp back up, but were you familiar that our finance director hasn't received any of this information from this council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5372.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I heard your answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5377.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't appreciate the response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5380.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that this has been a total lack of disrespect to this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5386.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have crises that we're dealing with right now that we're looking at financial support and hoping for some financial support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5396.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we don't know where we are financially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5400.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, so to move forward with any of these dog and pony requests, and then ask for funding for deeply needed, uh, resolves and not having an understanding of where we are financially is very difficult for me as a Councilor to make decisions, moving the city forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5425.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5428.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope everybody that's watching and understands realizes how dysfunctional this community looks right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5439.379s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many issues that we're seeing that coming across from us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5443.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is so totally embarrassing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5446.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm disheartened right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5447.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So Bob, again, I apologize for the answer that the chief of staff just gave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5453.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The understanding is this, we have been asking for money papers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5457.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the day after we had our budget and we've been trying to get some information, some valuable information of where we're going, what direction we're in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5466.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're trying to figure out what tonight's a very important meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5469.52s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's some resolutions tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5470.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're talking about some very important issues and looking to fund some very important issues, but getting the okay from the administration to fund papers and then not understanding where we are, because I believe the mayor, you were there when the mayor said as critical as last year's budget was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5487.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: next year's is going to be even worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5490.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what puts me on edge right now, Bob, is the fact that we haven't seen anything and we can't move to support our most neediest members of our community and resolutions that are coming forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5502.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I find this very disheartening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5505.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I find this very troubling and I don't know how my 16, 17 year old daughter<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5516.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: has the ability to run her finances better than what we're seeing with this multi-million dollar corporation called Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5524.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and again, I know it's not you Bob, but I had to express my concerns and disgust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5530.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5718.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please, I think until we have all the information in front of us and Bob has time now to get the documentation that we need to move this forward or to understand it, I think we need it immediately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5730.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's something that, you know, we've been asking for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5735.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: forever so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5828.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5860.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5861.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate taking this out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5864.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This has been a very emotional last 24 hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5868.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's been very intense and I wanted to make sure that if you allow me to give a small presentation that I prepared so I don't miss anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5884.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Medford's in crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5886.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not a new crisis, but one that has started to spiral out of control and has just caught the attention of the outside world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5895.999s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sadly, we had many years of warning given to us to prevent the latest incident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5902.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as we see today, those warning signs were ignored by the very people that were entrusted to protect our kids by acting on our behalf.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5912.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Most of you know my background as a former coach, teacher, and now Assistant Director of Recreation for Neighborhood Community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5922.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wanna look at a few fundamentals to see where we missed out, where we made our mistakes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5929.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First thing that came to me is, are our kids safe?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5934.099s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, they're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5938.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not the data that we need now, we now have the actual proof<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5942.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: from our experiences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5944.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we doing all that we can to keep our kids safe so they can learn and grow successfully?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5949.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, the warning signs are there and we ignored it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5955.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we unified on this issue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5958.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Absolutely not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5960.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sadly, some people take their responsibility serious while others do not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5966.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I question the personal motives<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5970.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: of some to simply protect their income versus protecting people that got them elected or hired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5981.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are outside groups currently bullying elected officials to exercise their views, which do not help to protect our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5990.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: National organizations, national movements, while we're having crisis here in our own backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5998.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is our division hurting our kids and the reputation of our city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6003.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, that's evident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6005.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The division in this great community is tragic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6010.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it continues, we'll just see the first of many situations that will bring our amazing city even further down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6018.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, two heads are better than one, and four heads are better than two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6024.041s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unified, we will overcome together,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6027.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: divided we will continue the sad, turbulent ride to a much worse place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6036.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, last night I was accused of politicizing this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6042.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My knee-jerk reaction was quickly defended to the categorization of being looked at and politicizing this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6053.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then I thought about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6055.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Of course I'm politicizing this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6057.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because that's the only way, the only mechanism that we, our kids and the citizens have to make any changes to our system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6066.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We live in a political system that requires checks and balances to protect our citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6072.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So being attacked with this term makes no sense and showed me exactly how those that are guilty continue to deflect away from their own inaction, neglect and responsibilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6087.486s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, we've learned that inaction equals action, meaning inaction enabled these outcomes, putting our kids in harm's way and making our parents petrified to send our kids to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6102.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the atrocity that we are looking at today, right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6110.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If anyone has been politicizing this issue, it's those that have been both enabling these outcomes and hiding from the consequences of their own inactions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6121.186s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We were elected by the people, for the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6125.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's time that we get to work for the people, especially our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6131.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: See, when we got elected by the people,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6135.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It should not be measured by winning or losing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6139.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It should be measured by the impact that we make and promises that we keep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6146.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is our opportunity that has presented itself to us today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6151.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The question was presented, what are we going to do about it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6157.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Here's what I propose to get us united, back on track and protect our kids the way that they require from us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6167.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First, I'm going to be asking the mayor to put together a team so we can put an implementation of safety that works with our teachers, our principals, our police department, so our kids feel safe when they go back on January 3rd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6191.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We want them to feel safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6194.794s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Meetings, consultants,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6197.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6199.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have true professionals in our building that we can work together over the next two weeks to make sure we have that plan in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6205.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sure of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6209.372s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have resolutions in place this evening that would ask the mayor to prepare an RFP to hire and train true security guards, four to five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6221.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Make sure that we have full staffing in the video room where our staff can watch a minute-to-minute action and who's going into the bathrooms, who's loitering in the hallways, to make sure our administration can see where these issues are happening and get<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6238.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the support there as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6241.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Last night, I believe it was Tony Puccio who brought up a very simple resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6249.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We ask our parents today to do everything, to be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6253.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he mentioned that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6255.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I thought that was a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6256.313s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I got home, I got a phone call from a former soccer captain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6259.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She went to school in Tulane, worked in Louisiana, and she sent me an article about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6265.313s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a program they use in the schools in Louisiana where they were having issues and concerns like we're having today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6271.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's called Dads in the Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6273.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe to be correct, we'll call it Dads and Moms in the Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6277.661s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we could put parents on a bus to go to a field trip to Plymouth Rock, then we could put parents in the school that want to assist our teachers to make sure they're just an extra eyes and ears as you walk the halls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6289.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I thank you, Mr. Puccio, for bringing that forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6292.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm going to ask the school committee to open up their meetings for public participation, where there's a dialogue like last evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6302.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if there's an issue with parents, students, or constituents, they have this forum to come and speak with a dialogue back and forth to make sure things are identified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6314.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The process that's in place right now, as some parents can tell you tonight, very daunting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6320.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to put it through, to ask to get approval, to read something, to write something up and making sure that what is going to be presented is approved is another form of censorship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6334.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If not, I'm gonna request this council to go back to the original request that Councilor Knight and I put forth as a ordinance change demanding that we put in place that format for the City School Committee so they have an avenue<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6350.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to have a voice and they can listen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6355.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this has been a very intense last 24 hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6362.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My daughter didn't go to school, nor did I believe close to 400 other students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6371.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The word back was that the police were there and they were present, but we also know that won't happen every single day for the rest of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6380.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I implore our school committee to work together with the police department to move forward to making sure that there's a plan in place over the next few weeks so we have our children feeling safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6401.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that leaves me with one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6406.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that she's not here right now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6409.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I want, I heard something last night from a very courageous young lady and I want to leave with something that she said that I take it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6416.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was directed to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6418.005s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's direct to all of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6419.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was very simple to, as she said, step up a step down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6424.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a responsibility and I hope we hear it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6430.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a responsibility to make sure that we're giving the tools to our leaders in the school, our principals and assistant principals, to make sure that they can run the schools as efficient as they did when they led the middle schools or before this administration, when they were part of the resolutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6452.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So let's unify this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6455.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's unify our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6457.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and let's make Medford the city that it's always been, an amazing place to live, work, and raise their family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6467.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8015.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8020.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The funding was there for the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8023.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe it was probably 80% of the funding that was cut for security over the last four years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8030.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the funding was there and the school system cut that funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8033.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8508.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8513.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: trying to be restrained and understanding something very simple that I want to share with my fellow Councilors that gave their opinions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8523.202s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Agree to disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8524.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done that many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8530.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8532.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're unsafe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8534.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're scared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8535.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our teachers are scared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8540.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To talk about money concerns and money issues should not be even a thought right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8548.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The thought and the discussion of 30 years ago, five years ago, is an embarrassment to me for the fact that this is happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8558.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is happening right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8563.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I talk about unifying, I talk about what I said as a national agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8571.297s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We see and hear the direction that the school committee has gone on many different levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8580.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And some school committees members have called me in the past and just didn't understand that they wouldn't fight if they didn't have their own voice, but to follow this national agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8594.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as I'm seeing,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8596.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the people that I looked at and trusted and admired, I'm seeing that they're taking not what's important today in our schools, not what's important, our children, not their safety, but to be in this council chamber yesterday and listen to some of these people that truly are aligned with people in this room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8621.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these issues are concerning to the community to understand<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8626.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we need to put that away, open our minds and be unified in the fact that the unification is needed for the safety of our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8637.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not what happened five years ago, not what happened 30 years ago, what's happening today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8643.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not gonna get the funding we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8646.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know that, but that's not gonna change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8648.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So bringing that up right now is really sad to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8654.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's just a buzzword and a check off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8659.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will tell you, we need movement now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8663.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need our school committee, our superintendent to move now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8670.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wanna see action now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8673.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's stop, let's hold school off for the next four days, three days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8676.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's bring our teachers into a room with our principals and let's find a solution right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8682.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So our kids are safe when it's time to go back to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8686.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the next few days are going to be useless.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8690.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's going to be no learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8693.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want to hear solutions from groups that are going to work together to make our kids safe on January 3rd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8701.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Safe when they go back to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8705.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to protect each other because what was said in another forum and how it was presented by this Councilor to people on different committees and try to protect what they're doing on the school committee side, I'm not afraid to speak for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8721.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Politically, I don't care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8723.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our kids are hurting and what people are seeing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8731.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and what they're hearing from the school committee are gender items that aren't protecting or looking at their safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8740.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was questioned that I was part of that school committee and there are legalities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8746.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I understood those legalities, but you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8750.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When it came to children's safety, George Scarpelli never swayed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8754.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I made sure that they were safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8757.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I never had this situation when I was on the school committee, thank God.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8763.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you, we can bicker back and forth and disagree, but ultimately, that wasn't my intention today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8773.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My intention is truly look at everybody and say, let's meet now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8777.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's bring everybody together now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8779.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's set a plan that's tangible that we can reach, that we're not gonna get grants from the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8785.071s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not gonna get funding from City Hall, but there's ways to get that done right now to make our children feel safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8794.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9834.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information. There's a difference between bullying and passion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9837.459s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what you lack, madam. You lack passion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9893.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information, Madam president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9897.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam Superintendent, yesterday a young man came to the podium and addressed the situation that happened. Did you hear the young man who described a very similar situation just a few weeks prior?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9911.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I asked the Superintendent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9915.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Was that addressed today? Did you contact the guidance Councilor that he talked to, to express the concern of the same people threatening him to stab him?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9927.671s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you address that today?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9947.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10443.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Would it be shocking, Madam Superintendent, that a few phone calls I did receive from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10449.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: personnel that were there to support, that there were still numerous students walking the halls freely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10458.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Has that even been addressed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10499.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, that's good to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10501.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As you approach the re-entry and starting the new year off, I would really hope, and what I've heard from the kids, is that your administration, yourself personally, bring the student body together so they can understand what's going on because they're lost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10519.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Over the last incident that happened, they were waiting for some sort of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10523.999s">[Scarpelli]</a>: acknowledgement of something and to keep them feeling safe, that was not done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10532.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope moving forward on the third, that the student body is in one area that they can see the leadership of our school system to show them that we're there and we understand what we're trying to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10545.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That hasn't been done yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10574.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's good to hear, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14642.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry, maybe you didn't understand what I meant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14646.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was the fact that I wanted to bring it back to today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14651.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to focus on today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14652.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can't go back to 30 years right now and worry about this today because today is the crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14659.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's my intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14824.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14825.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15121.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15161.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15312.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15378.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15651.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=824.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=826.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, George Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=829.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 27 Butler Street, Matthew, Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=831.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, what I'm hearing on what we've seen today was horrific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=840.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I hear and see from this committee is just as bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=845.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't something that we're looking at systemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=848.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something right now that's happening right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=851.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our kids are afraid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=852.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My daughter doesn't want to go back to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=856.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Where is the urgency?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=859.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Where is your urgency?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=862.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A few weeks ago, we had parents up here talking about the fear they had about their daughter being beaten up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=869.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we had a consultant and I've asked teachers, I've asked students, have you seen the change?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=875.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing, nothing, nothing has been done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=883.78s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to sit back, I'm gonna speak and then I'm gonna leave because I don't want it back and forth, Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=891.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what we're seeing with my daughter, her friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=895.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I ran up to the high school just so I could be present for her, just so I could tell her her dad's outside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=905.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see over and over again, I saw Madam Superintendent, this is not an isolated incident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=911.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To write that this is an isolated incident and to say publicly this is an isolating incident is false.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=917.93s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=921.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=924.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm scared, and I'm disgusted, and I feel bad for my daughter and her friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=931.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this might be not the best thing a city council should do, coming up in front of a body and expressing themselves with this motion, but I don't care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=943.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have principals and assistant principals that are running around that school with no support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=951.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for rules that have been implemented by this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=955.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Give him back the tools, give them back the tools so they can run the school system the way they see fit to keep our kids safe, period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=965.079s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then look at your studies and then look at your consultants and see what they said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=975.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll be honest with tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=976.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've asked for an emergency meeting didn't didn't go through only three members voted for an emergency meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=982.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a forum for people don't feel like they've been heard today to be up for the city council tomorrow and express their concerns and I will be honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=990.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My daughter will not be going to school and her friends are not going to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1050.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1051.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will tell you, as a parent, you're asking me to have a back and forth?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1057.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a colleague, I haven't heard one word from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1060.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I haven't had one word from anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1062.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've publicly put this out there because we haven't heard one word from any of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1067.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, one word, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1069.52s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will tell you, as a former member of this body, I worked diligently to make sure that we implemented a plan to keep our children safe from bullies, not the opposite, because that's what we're feeling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1081.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what our kids are feeling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1083.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whether you want to see it or not, our children are telling us that they feel that you're protecting the bullies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1090.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're allowing them to run the show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1094.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you ask any kid, any child up there, they're telling me that they feel unsafe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1100.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're telling me that they don't have the structure that they felt in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1105.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to tell me that the tensions, suspensions, well guess what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1109.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you're saying that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1111.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's not happening, it's not getting to the ones that it's happening to, because the kids are saying that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1117.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The kids are telling me that there's no suspensions, that they're not gonna get detention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1123.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The kids are saying it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1126.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe so, but let me ask you one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1130.171s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've had assemblies for everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1132.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: After that incident with that young lady, did you bring that student body in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1136.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you bring that student body in and give them security to let them feel that they would be safe?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1141.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have any of you, other than Go Mustangs or emails to people that if they get to them or not, did you sit in front of the student body yourselves?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1151.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: After that incident, look them in the eye in the gymnasium, like you did when you were all there cheering them on for the football game, and look them in the eye and say, you're safe because of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1161.191s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're safe because we're going to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1163.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You did not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1167.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1169.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1169.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1173.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That doesn't have to be a law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1184.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We understand that, but that doesn't mean the tact and the professionalism that you have from your teachers and administrators up there to bring the rest of the student body in and to let them know that they're in a safe environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1198.261s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You don't have to disclose anything, any other news about what's legally can be said and what can't be said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1204.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're all educated, very bright people to sit our student body down and look them in the eye and say, you're okay and this is why it's gonna happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1212.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not asking you to disclose any information about the perpetrator, the person who was injured.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1219.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not saying that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1221.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let the kids know that they're safe, because you haven't done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1225.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You haven't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7455.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7496.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Members of the school committee, the police department, our teachers that we set up a team summit, so we can work with our children so they can tell us what they want, just like the brave young men and women that were here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7509.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that will be the dialogue that needs to be started, there'll be a few others, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7514.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As Mr. Puccio said earlier, we allow our parents to monitor lunches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7521.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We allow our parents to monitor different various programs throughout the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7527.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe it's time that we ask those parents, and myself included, that we get more involved on a daily basis at Medford High School so the kids see our faces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7537.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not to be the policemen, not to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7546.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: express this, the communication that I've gotten back from students and parents over the last 24 hours and before, is the understanding that we are very fortunate to have a headmaster like Paul DeLava.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7562.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Paul DeLava.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7566.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know Paul DeLava will be very upset because someone's talking kindly about him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7571.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But Paul DeLava was part of that group that when I was a school committee member, he was a coach, he was a teacher, he loves Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7580.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So whatever was implemented after that, whatever stigma that's out there that people are portraying what that administration can do or can't do, let's try to find a way to correct it and make sure we don't lose people like Paul DeLava and his staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7597.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if we lost him right now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7599.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we would be going back years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7601.945s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for your attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=51.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=53.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that it was a resolution that I put forth that I appreciated all of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=64.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, talk and discussions around the Thanksgiving Day football game and being Fenway Park and how important that was and how we could, you know, the recognition of a football game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=73.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think what's more important that had to be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=78.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that our young people have to see that committees like this council and more recognize what these young men and women do<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=90.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and coaches do for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=94.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would love that we could ask the Medford High School football team and coaching staff to appear to the city council and we make a motion that if we can have citations made and just to recognize what they've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=111.436s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what I'm trying to say is you have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=114.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a program just a few short years ago that almost didn't have enough kids for one team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=120.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now they're close to 60 to 70 kids that are playing on the team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=126.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That being so important because you're seeing kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=130.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And from what I gather, it's a lot of kids that are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=134.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not the don't have the support that that most kids have in their families so leaning on each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=143.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's something that's so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=144.69s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's such a great tool to have a team like the high school football team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=148.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what you realize is what they're doing in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=152.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and giving back to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=154.666s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We forget about wins and losses, forget about all that, throw that all away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=158.268s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when you have a leader like John Curley, the football coach, who's going out with his team and help organizing and running National Night Out, the whole football team showing up and working with the police department to organize a National Night Out event or in September where they helped the senior citizens<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=176.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: clean out their basements or in October, when they helped with this in support of the unified basketball program, where they're, they're, they're boys and girls dressed up and mascots and supported in support of the team in November, again helping with the unified football Thanksgiving Day game, and then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=196.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I thought really struck me was a neighbor called and says, well, the football team is coming out to rake our leaves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=203.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, yeah, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=205.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, but that's what they were doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=207.051s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They went out to neighbors that couldn't rake their leaves and were stuck in the house and the football team came out and rake their leaves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=216.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that they're actually going to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=222.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they're doing a gift certificate drive to support the Medford family connection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=226.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's important that people hear this and why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=230.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because you hear so many negative things now, especially what's going on in the last couple of months at Medford High School and everything you hear in TV and how negative things are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=240.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we're lucky because we do have a lot of very good kids at Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=245.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And looking at the football team and the leadership from the coach, John Curley, and what they've done,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=252.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't mind that you're not winning the Super Bowl.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=255.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's okay for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=257.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I love the idea that we can read these stories and talk to neighbors and talk to senior citizens, how the football team has come out and helped this community and given back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=266.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it was funny last night, I talked to a teacher and they said, Hey, you, you have something on the agenda for the football team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=271.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the coach said, yeah, I just wanted to thank him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=274.02s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he said to me, um, I had an issue with one of the players and I just wasn't getting to him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=280.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I contacted coach Curly and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=283.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Coach Curley, during his lunchtime, went to Medford High School, and when this young man sat down in a seat, his football coach sat behind him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=293.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it was funny because I said, well, that's a scare tactic as a joke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=297.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he said it was total opposite.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=299.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What that young man felt, because their football coach cared enough that he would take his lunch and sit behind him,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=307.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and at the end of the class, have a dialogue to make sure that both the teacher and the football coach is in this working together to make sure they achieve their highest capability possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=319.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to me, I think that speaks volumes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=321.981s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I really want Coach Curley and the football team to be here and to be recognized and given a citation so they can understand that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=331.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We see this people see this, and this can be just as contagious as the bad things, the negative talk you hear, but when you see teams like this and you see coaches like this lead lead lead our young people, you know, in the positive light.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=345.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what our community is built on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=347.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what makes Medford, Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=349.372s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is what Mustang Pride is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=352.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If anybody thinks that Mustang Pride is about putting on a football helmet and running through a tornado, that means nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=359.164s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To be a Mustang, to have Mustang Pride, this is what it's about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=361.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Giving back to the community, understanding that there's something bigger than you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=366.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I want to just make sure that we commend our coaching staff, especially Coach Curley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=372.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the football association under Chris Murphy is his leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=378.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that that whole association should be recognized and I would make that a formal motion to invite them next week to the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=385.768s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1164.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I think if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1168.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that Council night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1170.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's exactly what I heard from our assessor and the understanding that in theory, it sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1175.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, where if you want your home, you'll get you'll get tax exempt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1179.372s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not the way the way that it's been been, uh, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1185.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: told to us that something that this council, especially some members of the council push for the understanding of keeping people in Medford when you're going to see how higher priced homes, which is a lot of times our three family homes, we want to keep people in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1203.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what I was told that as you're looking at those people that most landlords aren't going to say, you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1213.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll take the hit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1214.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My taxes are going to go up, but I'm going to take that hit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1218.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1219.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We want people to still afford to live in Metro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1221.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What's going to happen is, again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1224.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the landlord's gonna put it back on the renter, and affordable housing even gets deeper and deeper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1229.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these are the reasons why that I'm gonna support the vote that I've taken since we've been here, and what our acting assessor has told us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1242.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not as simple as the wording of, you're on your home, you're,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1249.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you're going to be exempt from the taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1250.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1251.544s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that you still have to understand where that money's coming from and who's going to take that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1258.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think it's just it just hurts our community if we approve that in totality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1264.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2083.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, to address a question to Mr. Coates, is this the final paving?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2104.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so, and yeah,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2106.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In your professional opinion, what we're seeing on the method side with the patchwork, with the manholes that are sunk in, is that acceptable?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2144.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we appreciate you being the person that we're addressing this to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2148.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think you have to understand the horror that these neighbors have gone through and just the idea when they see the work that's not up to par and the idea that maybe in the next six months,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2162.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that they could have machinery again, going up and down that corridor, fixing a mistake that we'll be talking about tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2170.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope you understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2173.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think my last question really is, what's acceptable for standards?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2183.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but the difference between what we see in Winchester and the difference that we see as soon as you cross the line in Medford, do you recognize that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2222.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is our fault, so our standards are lower?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2228.079s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, you did say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2229.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What you said was that the standards in that community are different than ours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2234.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's exactly what you said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2235.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my question is, being the professional, the standards that's allowed in Winchester<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2242.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: wouldn't be allowed what we have in Medford in that act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2275.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if I can ask our engineer while you're on the phone, while you're here in this presentation, if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2282.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So from what I'm hearing, the reason why we have patchy work and that we feel that it's subpar, it's because, not you per se, but we Medford told Eversource to pave it that way, piecemeal like that, because that's what I'm hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2344.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just so you know, and just the conversation I had with paving companies that do highways and so on, they did tell us<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2351.417s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The longevity or the length of that reliability for that roadway, because there are seams, are drastically different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2365.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what they came out with, I went out there with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2367.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They looked at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2368.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They said, what I'm saying is seam is what we see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2370.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what we see, no matter what it is, they've told me- I've also been doing this for 20 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2381.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then they'll be able to... So what safeguards do we have in the next season?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2423.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so just for entertainment's sake,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2429.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you had your choice, would you have rather done what Winchester did?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2435.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And having no seams?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2440.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm saying as a professional that we pay for the city of Medford, who is you, would you recommend that or would you recommend the piece?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2452.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, that's not good right now, my friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2454.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm asking you as a as a city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2456.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is what we don't need on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2458.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the problem we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2459.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we're going after our smaller businesses and saying we're going to pay curb to curb.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2464.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that that fee goes up to our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2466.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2467.071s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're asking for one of the richest companies in the Commonwealth<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2471.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to make sure they pave a road the way the standards that those neighbors deserve, right, my friend?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2475.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is what I'm asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2477.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you don't really see that, this is what we need, because we've been crying for years that we should have a clerk of the works, that we find a way that we have a clerk of the works for these jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2487.099s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because what Councilor Caraviello is saying is the person that ever saw us has promised us that's going to work with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2493.261s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe they've worked with you, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2497.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or department at City Hall, the mayor's office or whatnot, but we haven't been getting any information on what's been going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2503.165s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is what's sad, this is why I have a resolution later about communication with the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2508.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the stuff, and I'm sorry, you're just the person that, and I know we've been called bullies, by the way, because I'm not trying to, I'm looking for a professional that's in our community that's gonna say, no, George,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2520.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2521.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The best thing is that, because the professionals that I'm friends with that said, yeah, let's go for a ride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2526.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we went for a ride and they said they do highways, big jobs across the country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2530.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They said, no, honestly, the truth of the matter is the best way to do it is no seams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2534.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, that's what they've told me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2536.233s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know you have 20 years of experience, but- I agree with your assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2540.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2565.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2567.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2568.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2569.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2570.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I again, I think the frustration is those neighbors that I, you know, your frustrations every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2575.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2577.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I, you know, this is, it's tough though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2579.571s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I, you know, whenever source, when they came in, they said there's no benefit to our residents, but they're going to at least leave it better than the way they saw it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2589.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I tend to disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2591.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would call Ebersole some shame, because if that's what you're leaving and that's what we're going to do and you're blaming, whatever, I'm not going to go there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=2600.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4068.92s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4069.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First, let me start off by addressing some concerns that my daughter has been reading on social media.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4077.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We love dogs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4079.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We love our dogs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4080.088s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've had dogs my whole life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4081.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I love my dog.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4084.311s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the question that I put this out is to really discuss the survey that is being put out there by the city administration<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4094.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to talk about specific hours in specific areas that we have unleashed dogs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4103.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First of all, there is a city ordinance that we as a city council have in our laws here in Medford that you're not supposed to have, you can't have unleashed dogs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4113.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4114.666s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why we're doing a survey without presenting this to the council or the understanding of what this means or what the repercussions mean, because right now you're having people, especially the kids, different sports organizations saying, hold on one second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4129.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've had issues in the past where my daughter was on the field and a dog was unleashed and oh, but it's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4135.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a good dog.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4138.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a good dog.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4139.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Until that one time that good dog<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4142.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: becomes violent or something scary happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4145.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And for the city administration to put anything out there right now is really disingenuine to this council and understanding our policies and laws here in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4158.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was a concern a few months back about Tufts Park and what we said<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4163.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: was, well, let's look into fencing the old pool area, because it's still a big area, and they could still have dogs roam in that area, but we put a fence up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4173.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the response was, no, because the people that wanted this movement said, that's still keeping their dogs within an area, and they're not free to roam.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4186.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I've read what the city has put out, and the process of having a survey, and the survey coming back, and they're gonna pick places in the city, maybe even fence them off, or cordon them off, and we're gonna set times for when people can go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4205.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can't even get information for the most vital issues in our community out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4211.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we're gonna let Nana be,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4214.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: who's gonna walk her three-year-old daughter through a certain park, and she didn't see the postings, and she doesn't understand the hours that there can be unleashed dogs in that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4227.621s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't understand the process and having a survey to go out to talk about a law, an ordinance that we already have in our community, that we have not only in the park side, but also in the city side that says we do not,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4244.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: have unleashed dogs in our community for safety reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4251.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there's a reason for the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4254.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It says an animal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4255.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's an animal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4257.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I love my dog like a human too, but it's still an animal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4260.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are no guarantees with that animal, especially around children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4273.02s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The end result is that people want to have certain hours, from what I've read, in our community in certain areas, but maybe not ballparks, it's said, but certain areas to leave unleashed dogs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4288.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's a dangerous, dangerous game to play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4291.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a reason why Councilor Marks work so hard to implement the dog park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4295.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are reasons why there are areas in the state side where the fells that they can run your unleashed dog.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4302.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why there are areas, but to designate city property and then put hours to it and think that we're going to have the bandwidth in that office to make sure it's communicated to every resident with their child and say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4320.51s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that as long as we post it, we're safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4323.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said, I think that's very, very dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4326.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think it's unsafe and it's just, it's a shame that it's put out there to appease people during political times saying that we'll just do a survey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4338.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when that survey says, absolutely, let's do 10 o'clock in the morning to two o'clock in the afternoon at Tufts Park,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4347.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: during the weeks that the kids are in school and to say, hey, that's great, we're gonna post it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4351.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we're gonna have that one day that Nana's gonna walk their child that doesn't have the post and the dog's gonna attack.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4359.202s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a very slippery slope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4360.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's very dangerous in that sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4363.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And believe me, and I'll say it again, George Scarpelli, what camera are we on, loves dogs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4369.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I love dogs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4371.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I also love and respect the people that traverse our community and wanna feel safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4377.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4379.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that my reason for putting this forward is really just to vent and then just to spread some of the concerns that residents did have that's saying that, well, if it happens, this survey happens, they open one spot, what's gonna stop it from moving on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4398.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that this is, you wanna focus on building a dog park for bigger dogs, you wanna think, well, let's figure that, let's work that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4406.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's look at Tufts Park and maybe closing off that area, fencing off a safe area where dogs can run in a bigger area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4412.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe that's the solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4415.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But to put it the way that it reads to me is that possibly having hours around the community for unleashed dogs, I think that's wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4424.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And more importantly, in the form of a motion, is I'd like the city administration to help this councilor understand<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4433.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: how we can ask for a motion for a city ordinance that's in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4437.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we changing it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4438.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Has anybody had talked about changing an ordinance about unleashed dogs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4442.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Cause I've never heard anything of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4444.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=5489.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, just real quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=5491.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the caller calling in, but again, I think Councilor Collins brings up the best point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=5497.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you identify, this is great that 35 people responded, but guess who those people that did the survey, guess where they're from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=5506.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're the dog lovers that walk their dogs off a leash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=5509.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So of course they're gonna get that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=5512.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the problem with the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=5514.231s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was the main question I had with the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=5518.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And regardless of that personally, I know I've been contacted by a few people from your committee or your program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=5526.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't care what other communities do in the city that I live in, that we have audiences from the city, public safety is number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=5534.855s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to allow it is dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=5537.016s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=5946.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=5947.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I put this forward, I think the frustration came out that as we walked in one day to City Hall, the chambers were used as a storage facility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=5957.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Probably the most hollowed ground in this building was being used as a closet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=5966.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Out front, the floors looked dirty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=5968.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=5970.223s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They were crates, empty crates in the front.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=5972.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They were floor washers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=5975.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that, you know, as part of this beautification committee that the mayor has in place, I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=5984.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as well with the city council, I'd like to work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=5987.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wouldn't mind getting my hands dirty, but when you come in here, which is supposed to be the most respected room in the community and the way it's being treated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=5996.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as I'm writing this, a real happy post went out and residents texted me and said, did you just see this post?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6007.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, what does it say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6009.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: During the farmer's market here, we had llamas<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6014.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in the foyer of City Hall, llamas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6019.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm working about dogs and we have llamas in the foyer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6022.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what I'm asking for is really to work with, ask the beautification committee, I know the mayor has a beautification committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6031.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in place already that we work together with the council to try to find a way to come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6035.202s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I'm not tooting my own horn, but I have a connection with a very important company, the Furniture Trust Company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6046.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They came in and donated so much furniture, new furniture for our office staff here to save our community money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6053.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I thank them for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6055.045s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one in the city has thanked them yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6057.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: City administration still hasn't thanked them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6059.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will put a resolution through later to thank the Furniture Trust Company that's been giving furniture and donating furniture throughout this building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6068.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But they were, that's what all that furniture was here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6071.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why this looks like a big closet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6073.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that we really need to start taking pride<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6076.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: right from the beginning, and that's when you walk through those doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6080.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm willing to work for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6083.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to get a group of people together and maybe come through the building and help move some things if they need, if we don't have staff enough to do that, but that would be my request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6093.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6096.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can we dress up in costumes on that day?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6232.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6233.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that to beat a dead horse here, but I understand that we have to do a business, but until we take a hard line and understanding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6244.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the finances of our community and especially what's going out to KP Law and especially the fact that there really is no urgency to hire a city solicitor or city assistant city solicitor until we truly understand the financial implications<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6260.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: of the mayor's legal consultants, which is KP Law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6268.494s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was reminded by a former Councilor for this resolution, just to remind us, when we voted on KP Law, if we can all remember, do all remember on the monthly costs that we were giving them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6279.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who remembers that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6280.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was $5,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6284.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know for sure it's definitely gone past that $5,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6287.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that there's been talk that this is the frustrating part of being a city councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6296.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're now moving in, excuse me, other communities where I work in the municipality, we are already in the middle of our budget talks for May and June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6307.368s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're all in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6309.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The directors already met with financial director a few times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6312.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're ready to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6313.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've already given our predictions, what our staff wants to, what they're looking for as a wishlist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6318.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're already all in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6320.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're seeing right now is we still haven't seen one financial paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6326.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't know if there's a reason for it because one of the common denominators is that we've asked for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6333.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the understanding or the amount of money that has been paid out to KP Law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6339.453s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what I'm requesting from my fellow Councilors to follow my lead in asking you to please refrain from asking for resolutions that ask for legal opinion from KP Law or legal opinion because the legal opinion that asks for KP Law, at least that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6357.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, I appreciate Councilor Knight that followed up on his resolution that he responded with asking for the city solicitor to give us an answer, knowing we don't have a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6373.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I will be public and transparent that I've reached out to a few former city solicitors that I've worked with, and I've asked them,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6385.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if they would apply.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6386.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And please help us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6388.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And and I said, I know we know we've been told by administration that it's difficult because it's a fight throughout the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6396.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the answer I got from city solicitors that I worked with the now in different communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6403.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a George has nothing to do with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6408.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the shortage right now, it's the fear of what they're hearing of what's happening to department heads in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6416.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that we should start looking at things straight on and figuring things out because things are getting, things have gotten away from us in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6428.236s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're in crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6430.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're in crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6432.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think the more that we support<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6436.159s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor's initiatives, especially with KP Law, the more we're giving evidence, the more we're showing, and I know it's tough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6441.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we're trying to do our business, but the truth of the matter is, are they really answering us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6446.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even when we ask, are they really getting back to us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6448.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are they really giving the answers that we need to help us succeed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6452.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I say no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6453.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I haven't seen, you know, we've done a lot of work, and Council President, I credit you with a lot of meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6459.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're doing a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6460.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but we seem to not to get anything done because where does it fall?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6464.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It falls for when it gets to legal opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6467.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, again, everybody has their opinion, but I asked my fellow colleagues to share with my motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6636.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand that we do need some protection when you talk about BJs, but again, I'd love to support that with bringing in Mr. Dickinson and see where we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6651.507s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6929.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6930.814s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6931.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This was when I wrote this, it was a few weeks back, and this was in conjunction with the horrifying situation for that young lady that endured the beating at Bedford High School and the lack of communication we got from the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6951.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that, you know, when I was in the school committee, one thing that we made sure that the superintendent reached out to all the stakeholders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6958.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that when I was a school committee, we made sure that our city councils knew when something very important happened in the school department, that we would be getting phone calls, especially something that dire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6969.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, um, we, we didn't get anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6971.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we got a, uh, something that was added to a, um, go Mustang page and then something in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6979.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It wasn't,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6980.64s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It wasn't anything that we were alerted to because it's something that at that level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6988.005s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, don't get me wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6989.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a student that has an accident in the gym class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6995.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a school committee member, I got a phone call saying, George, just so that you know, the ambulance just left from the Glynn School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7000.814s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had a young person break their wrist in phys ed at basketball.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7005.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7006.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand it's on the school committee side, just on the city side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7009.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we should be informed with issues that, especially dealing with the horrific issue that was brought to that situation, and newspapers and news trucks, and we're getting phone calls from news outlets, and we're getting phone calls from parents, but I don't know what you're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7031.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they said, how do you not know what we're talking about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7035.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7038.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's something that I find very disheartening, so I think that's why that was put in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7042.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for hearing my cry, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7682.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7683.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thanks for my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7684.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I'm looking at this in a different way that we can look at it and showing showing our community how this can work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7692.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: by going out in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7693.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that, you know, like I'll say it again, I hate to say it, but when you're working in a community, in a municipality, when you want something to change, you want something to happen, you go through the community, you set up round table events where people come out and share what their concerns are, and then the rebuttal or the communication back and forth to make sure this works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7716.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, traffic and parking fees and fines in our neighbor community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7721.177s">[Scarpelli]</a>: people were outraged after they went through roundtable discussions to each neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7727.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they came back and they said, okay, so you're saying these fees and fines are going to go directly to our school system, that our roads will be swept on a daily basis and our playgrounds will be safe and clean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7745.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, let's see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7747.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7750.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the big conundrum, the big issue and concerns, the negativity was put to rest once people really understand where the benefits are and where that can go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7764.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, what we're hearing over and over again is the lack of communication to who?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7771.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The citizens of this community and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7776.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's where I agree with Councilor Knight that this cannot work and this won't work unless we have a way that we can turn to each other and say, this is how, why this is happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7788.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, granted, when you're sitting in front of someone to tell them you're gonna raise fees and fines, they're gonna look you in the eye and tell you they're wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7795.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But ultimately, you made the decision to explain it and you move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7799.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have yet to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7801.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in many things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7802.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My phone's been blowing up about how people were part of this dog commission, and this is something that, and Brookline, how things change and shame on you, and this is wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7814.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Fine, fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7817.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've talked to 30 of my neighbors that asked about this dog situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7820.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They don't live in Brookline, they don't walk their dog off a leash, and there's a huge lack of communication in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7829.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The last two resolutions speak volumes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7832.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we saw a huge, huge difference with the relationship with the police and neighborhood policing when council Falco made this motion to move it to neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7841.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we actually joked about it because council Falco every week would give a summary and say, don't forget community policing will be held this night in this location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7850.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you want, you want to know the truth?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7853.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The police loved it, and the neighborhood loved it because that always filled the room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7857.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they sat there, and like Chief used to say, they used to take it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7862.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then when they were left, they were shaking hands saying, oh, now I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7866.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And boy, does that help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7868.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So communication is key for success in anything we do in life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7872.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we're lacking right now in this city is a true lack of communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7876.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think these resolutions help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7878.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you to my colleagues to support if they will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8509.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to the chair, to council night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8511.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So just, just to be clear, I'm on the negotiating team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8515.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I work in a municipality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8517.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you're telling me that at first I've heard of it and it's appalling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8520.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if someone's accrued 20 years of service in their community and accrued and earned their sick time, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8533.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I do that myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8535.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a process with when you're talking about before, you know, looking at FMLA, looking at different processes to make sure you're saying that in the city right now we have, there's an avenue now that employees that have earned that sick time can't use that time accrued.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8554.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what brought to my understanding, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8558.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That bothers me in so many ways, because when you look at accrued sick time, these are the reasons why you use that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8569.099s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why you save it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8569.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why you save it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8571.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why you want people to work when they can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8574.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the financial implications of that, if that's what's happening, in the long run, I know that it must be pretty similar in this municipality, like our municipality,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8586.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you leave and you have certain vacation days, accrued sick time, you can actually buy those days back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8594.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if you have a member in his 20th year that wants to use that time, deservedly so, that comes out of, financially, you're looking at that one way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8607.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But then if you look at the end result, the 30 years, what you're going to be paying out for that employee for those years that you withheld those days,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8617.233s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's so many negative ramifications with that process, I think it's appalling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8624.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know you brought up the piece which I think is the most important piece, the heart, the humanitarian piece, that you've accrued that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8634.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You need to find a way that if you were on workman's comp, there's a reason why that you got hurt on the job, in the city, working for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8643.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've accrued those days, you've earned those days,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8646.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now you can't use those days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8648.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want to make sure I'm clear that I'm really hearing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8704.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for the clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8705.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's a disgusting, disgusting policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8708.424s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I stand with you, and I would second that resolve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8710.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's horrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9124.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Knight for bringing that forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9127.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That speaks volumes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9131.584s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I had the privilege of speaking with Mrs. Branley privately, and what punched me in the face was the reason why I ran for City School Committee back in 2008 when I left the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9149.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something that's uncomfortable,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9151.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I didn't say anything then, but my son was bullied to horrific, horrific levels where we talked to him every day about it today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9160.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he's a well-rounded young man that I'm proud of every single day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9165.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I made that decision to run for school committee because I wanted to make a change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9170.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the key piece of that was I left the politics behind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9175.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I joined the school committee, I left politics aside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9180.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's disgusting that this comes back around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9182.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when Mrs. Bramley talks about it, it just brings me back to the reason why I ran originally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9189.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wasn't a true politician.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9190.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was a phys ed teacher and the kids loved me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9194.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's why I was, that's why I topped the ticket because everybody loved Mr. S. And then I realized my role and how important it could be and the changes we can make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9205.11s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then I said, you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9206.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm going to do more because I realized with that administration, I could do more on the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9213.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then I joined the city council and you saw some great things happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9223.695s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody that I've talked to that read this and called me said, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9227.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is amazing because we don't have an avenue to talk to our schools, school department or school administration or school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9236.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And at least this gives us an opportunity that it's uncomfortable for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9240.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know what's uncomfortable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9241.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was a school kid member making some huge changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9243.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm a city council that has to make huge decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9247.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But to sit there and look the person in the eye, it's honorable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9251.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's what we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9252.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's what we should all do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9254.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And all I keep hearing over and over again is that we're not being heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9259.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So why did it get to this extreme?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9260.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I waited 24 hours and I called Mrs. Branley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9265.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I couldn't wait for her to say, George, they called me right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9270.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I got the information that I needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9272.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My daughter feels safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9273.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our kids, everything's moving in the right direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9291.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Cause it's not popular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9292.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we were asking for right now isn't popular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9295.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if the people that support my school community members were good people, but it's gonna hurt me politically, I don't care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9308.236s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this ordinance, this ordinance speaks volumes to the people that work for our community, care about our community, every single day, the most important people, our teachers and our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9322.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And yesterday sat in that crowd, we stood in that crowd, Councilor Caraviello and I. And I was proud, I was proud that I was supporting our teachers in this battle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9333.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's funny, what keeps coming back is the lack of communication, dialogue, because what was said publicly in front of everybody through the Teachers Association, and then what was said in a closed meeting, an open meeting at school committee, and what was said that there was, there's a contract already, there's a ratified contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9352.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, there isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9354.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was part of a negotiating team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9356.373s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, there isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9359.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The negotiating team met with the city school administration, city administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9363.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They came to a plan that they can now send to the body and they vote on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9369.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then the body decides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9371.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what we do in this country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9376.148s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And from what I hear, because we weren't given, the negotiating team didn't let this information out, but last night a school administrator said that the votes were close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9386.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I taught for 15 years, we ratified a contract, at the end of the vote, it was always 80, 90% in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9394.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not by 27 votes, that's still failure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9396.764s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even if it won by a vote, it's still failure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9399.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's still telling you something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9403.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even tonight, what do we talk about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9404.563s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What do we all say tonight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9406.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What a disgrace of a lack of communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9410.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we have the second strongest governing body in our community, a third.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9414.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I don't know where we are now, but they're a forum where people need to let the information that they know or they feel has to be brought out to the public, understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9429.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's not to put anybody out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9431.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not to make you feel uncomfortable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9433.745s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's to share the information that's vital.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9447.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It stymies the process of open forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9449.297s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It stymies the process of sharing information that's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9454.78s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll tell you, when I left that meeting yesterday,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9458.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And teachers came up to me, great teachers, teachers we know and love.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9462.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know Councilor Bears wrote an impassionate, and they wanted me to share that they appreciated that, and they know that we're supporting the teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9485.016s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that teachers and parents and kids can come to a podium, to a body that they elected and say, we need help, or we need justice, or we need support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9495.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or do you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9496.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know Councilor Knight hates it, or just to come up and speak because it's their forum, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9508.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm gonna, again, I say this because you have to hear this to the Branley family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9516.247s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sometimes in horrible situations, great things come out of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9521.311s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think this is something that if it's supported by this council, that's gonna be resounding for a long time to come because we're gonna have a voice and someone's gonna have to listen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9535.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And for a personal level, thank you for showing me why I took this job and why I do what I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9540.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9543.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, councilor, I ask my council colleagues that I know it's not comfortable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9549.526s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's very uncomfortable because a lot of those people are our friends, but sometimes you have to make a decision that's bigger than yourself and bigger than a political line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9562.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I ask everybody to support this ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9565.621s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10764.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10766.168s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I understand Councilor Villes and bringing that B paper up, but again, I've said in the past, I can't support anything when it comes to financial, this revert back had nothing to do with this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10779.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will not support any initiative that goes to the mayor to ask about spending more money when we don't know what the money looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10787.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I wouldn't support that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10788.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the other piece is very important that as a former school committee member,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10792.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, this is a difficult decision to make, and this is a hard line to cross.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10797.429s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But over and over again, when you speak to the educators that you all love and respect, and they tell you that there is no forum that they can reach and talk to on the school committee, when you talk to the kids that we all talk about how we want to support, that they don't have an avenue that the parents can go to that forum and speak on an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10818.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10820.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, again, the parents in situations like this, I know this situation's driving, drove this issue, but we're talking about asking a school committee that, by the way, voted to eliminate security guards, who voted to implement a suspension process because it affected an uneven balance and not looking at what's in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10849.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're seeing what's happening right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10851.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sure the Bramleys, or the kids that are being bullied, or the parents that can't speak, or the parents that don't have a voice, truly don't care about any systemic issue right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10861.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They wanna know to make sure that their child is safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10865.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if this is the extreme that we need to move on, I think this is where this body can, if it against mass general law, like Councilor Knight said it, let it come out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10878.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are some of these things that we can work on to change as an ordinance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10881.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, maybe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10883.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the bottom line is, teachers last evening, teachers that you support, children that you support, parents that support you, came to me there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10895.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and reiterated the fact that this is an unbelievable stock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10899.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that we are now finally having an opportunity to hold the school committee accountable for what the citizens see as a severe concern and issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10911.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is just an avenue that they can just go to a forum and speak because they don't have that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10916.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to say that they do, no, they don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10921.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a system in place that you can petition it, then you can come up and you can speak, and then that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10927.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No dialogue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10939.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's a serious motion last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10944.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They voted zero confidence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10947.69s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the people we trust, my former colleagues, our teachers, our children's teachers, you know them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10953.913s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If they voted for that purpose, it should hold some weight enough that this council should move this forward to show the school committee that this process needs to be adjusted on their end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10973.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I, again, I understand that it's not comfortable<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10978.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and I understand as a former school committee member, I'd be appalled, but as a former school committee member, I would never have let my body get in this way and do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10994.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want us all to understand, all we're asking for is a forum where people can come up and talk to our elected officials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11004.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're telling us they can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11006.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's that simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11009.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So a vote tonight, symbolic or not, a vote tonight is to show the school committee that we need to move this forward to the next step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11019.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if the next step says, Massachusetts General Law says we can't do it, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11024.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This council put the most important piece forward first, and that's the teachers and the students and the line of communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11036.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11330.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you feel what you've seen and what we've gone through for the last few months, do you feel that the school committee is given an avenue<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11340.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for our constituents to go and speak on concerns and issues that we think is vital to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11351.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But Anne Avenue, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11353.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So with that, I would say, I'm not asking the school committee to change any policy or procedure dealing with how to run the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11365.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm asking them,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11367.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm asking us to support an ordinance that brings the school committee, bring the constituents, our constituents, our parents, our teachers, a forum that they can go to and speak on concerns and issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11380.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11381.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It has nothing to do with the policies that they have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12085.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, if I can, I, again, the reason why it was brought forward,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12093.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The reason why we're here is, you know, the reason why this was something that was important is because we have that opportunity for you to talk to that microphone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12104.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that you would rather be doing it to the people that have to make the decisions, because like we said, we can't make a decision, but when they're not being heard,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12114.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you're not being heard, like I said, two days later when we talked, no one's reached out to you yet, trying to figure out a resolution, or at least bring your daughter's mind at ease, or your family's mind at ease, you have to come to this forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12128.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think it's something that I don't want to see die, and I think that, like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12136.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council and I said to let it rest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12139.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would support that would go to the committee of the whole if our colleagues will indulge us and then maybe we could sit down and see what legally we can and can't do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12148.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then see if there's an option that maybe the school committee sits back and sees this and says, well, maybe we need to readjust and what our policies are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12159.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And maybe we need to have our forum open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12162.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So because it's got to this point, everyone, it's not, this isn't,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12165.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is uncomfortable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12167.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it is, but it's gone to this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12169.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that uncomfortably, it's your position and it's your family that's paid the price, but it also opened a lot of people's eyes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12178.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And like I said, personally, I'll never, I readjusted who I am as a person because of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12184.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and I know it's not easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12186.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's not easy, but thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12668.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm going to be calm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12670.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can't just say, because I agree, Council Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12673.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are initiatives that we need to focus on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12677.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that funding these initiatives are great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12680.584s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what we're asking for is free.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12684.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're asking us to have a forum that our constituents can meet with our school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12688.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12689.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the point where this word is brought up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12691.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what the issue is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12692.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I agree with you a thousand percent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12694.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I won't vote on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12695.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I won't support it because of financial, my background with financial issues until we see our numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12699.77s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we also have a school committee that voted in policies<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12706.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that hinder the situation from being resolved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12709.436s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, we wouldn't know that because the parents can't speak to that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12712.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=13118.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=13119.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I talked to conversations, uh, clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=13123.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know there was some outstanding paperwork that we're waiting on that has now been approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=13129.01s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything is in order and in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=13131.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, I know that is that is the petitioner online?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=13136.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=13136.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=13137.436s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that that's basic questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=13139.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that other councils Alaska know that how many employees will be working, uh, for the for this company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=13146.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are they free to speak?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=13174.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for the approval, I think that we need to, do you have all the paperwork in order?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=13177.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are they all workman's comp paperwork in order?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=13188.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The hours of operation, I know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=13190.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yep, 7 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=13194.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: perfect that falls and it needs to be changed, you know, that has to, um, if it goes past the ordinance hours, it needs to be, um, that needs to be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=13202.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But, um, I see everything else in order, Madam President, uh, Mr. President, so I would move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=13214.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=115.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, thank you, madam president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=117.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, uh, I know that Casa Caraviello has said it all, but, um, I know that the, uh, what, what buddy Clayton did, um, uh, what he's done for our community and the way he's raised his children to give back to our community and his grandchildren is something that, uh, is a great example for all of us to follow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=140.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was a true gentleman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=141.187s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=141.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think I've ever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=144.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: ever recalled Mr. Clayton ever having a sour puss in his face or an angry look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=150.999s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was always smiling, always pleasant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=153.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if you look at his children, they have the same demeanor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=156.221s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, he was a great man.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=159.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He, he leaves, uh, uh, an unbelievable legacy and, uh, he's truly going to be missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=165.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, um, especially in the West, West Medford neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=169.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, uh, condolences to his family, madam president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=172.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=230.209s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can we just let Councilor Cabell know that I know he's got his earplugs in, but we can hear Carol's conversations, Ricky, just so you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=240.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Tell her I said hi, I love that recipe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=419.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, no, I'll step, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=464.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I found them all in order, Madam President, move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=467.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=697.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, it seems like it's pretty simple, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=701.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can the petition just let us know what this process is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=704.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it leaving ownership?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=707.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it just staying within the ownership of different people within the system?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=736.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Same employees, everything's the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=740.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I'd be honest with you, Madam President, Eddie's place has been... I've never heard a complaint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=746.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I'm a little biased.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=748.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My daughter's favorite... So, she... Grilled chicken salad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=754.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, all the order, everything is in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=759.705s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would move approval with any questions from my fellow council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=764.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=800.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, buddy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=802.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=948.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, go ahead, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1577.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1578.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I think that Ellen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1582.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that Ellen has just always explained where people have asked for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1592.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the exemption for residential and how that impacts our community if we went that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1599.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that you always had a statement that really just summarized it and really helped people understand why it's not really a good fit right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1610.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So can you just elaborate on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1701.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's exactly what I wanted to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1703.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want to make sure that that's a brief understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1705.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you again for all your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1707.268s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we really thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2233.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President, Councilor Caraviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2235.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much because I had to set some phone calls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2239.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The phone calls I got were very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2241.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: very evident when I went out and witnessed it myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2244.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One thing the neighbors in that area wanted me to focus on were the sore covers and how they are already dipping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2254.088s">[Scarpelli]</a>: um, in those areas around every store covered either in the middle of the street of the side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2257.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, and councilor councilor Caraviello is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2261.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I took that ride specifically because I brought this issue up and how they treat a method in comparison to Winchester, where they left the roads impeccable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2271.821s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When they left every evening, they moved all the apparatus into the, uh, T parking lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2276.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was nothing on the streets and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2280.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And like Councilor Caraviello said, took that ride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2283.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As soon as you entered into Winchester, you don't see seams, you don't see the manholes that are below level that are already causing a divot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2295.264s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate you bringing this forward and I'd like to know what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2301.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what the DPW director shared with Councilor Caraviello because I had questions for him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2308.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm glad he called Ricky, but this is an important issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2313.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that, you know, we've already talked at city engineers already talked about, you know, people that are pulling permits and going curb to curb on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2321.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: on residential questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2323.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now, if we're gonna hold residential pavers accountable, where do we stand right now with, you know, the big three, you know, Eversource, National Grid, and our city paving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2341.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2372.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, madam president, if I can point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2375.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2376.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I suggest we contact the contact people that came out for us in the summer and ask for their presence at our next meeting for next Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2384.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2384.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I make that as a form of motion if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2387.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2387.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2388.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll second that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2412.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would have to see to that that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2418.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3002.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These students- Madam President, if I can, Nicole, I hate to, we're having trouble hearing you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3008.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is there any way we can raise the volume?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3011.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, you're a little soft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3017.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's an important message, so I don't want anybody to miss it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3508.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3509.509s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, thank you, Mr. Brownlee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3512.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It takes a lot of courage to do what you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3515.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's easy just to keep your mouth shut and walk away and hope things are going to be okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3519.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I know I've talked to you personally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3523.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we all share situations about children being bullied, mine as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3528.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a city councilor, we have a school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3530.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and the mayor who's the president of that committee that are in charge of making sure that they follow through these issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3539.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So as a city councilor, it's very difficult to cross over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3543.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'll leave that with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3546.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that you had some, without getting that information, you had some interest to talk to the city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3552.223s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we talked about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3553.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, I informed you that we don't have a city solicitor because you were asking who you can speak to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3558.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that I apologize for on our end,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3561.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I'm going to speak right now as a parent of a Medford High School student, someone that has had their kids go through the system from preschool all the way through high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3572.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a member of a teacher in the system and a member of the school committee that did everything in my power to make sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3580.692s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We put in strongholds to make sure that our kids are protected, putting in bullying protection programs, setting up mentoring programs, making sure the kids that don't want to be in the school and that are harming our children every single day, that they're the ones that are being looked at and those are the ones that are being taken to task.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3601.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And unfortunately, what we hear over and over again, especially with this story with the Bramley family, it seems like that's not the priority right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3612.29s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I told you in a meeting months ago when this happened,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3615.93s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're still seeing the uh, the the children that that that can't go to the bathroom because the the bad kids or the kids that don't care are using those bathrooms and And going kids not eating in cafeterias And finding little nooks and crannies to eat throughout the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3634.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's despicable That's horrifying to me and why<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3640.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and why the kids are telling me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3641.969s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're telling me that the administration's in the buildings afraid to punish kids because of rules that are put into place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3648.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I think we need to revisit these rules and make sure that we hold a school committee and our mayor and the school administration, the superintendent, to task, that this is their job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3663.427s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm not talking as a city councilor, because I'm out of line if I was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3666.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm talking as a parent of a senior at Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3670.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I hear ridiculous comments like, geez, maybe this child should go to a private school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3677.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe she should just leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3679.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are you kidding me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3681.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The Branleys did nothing wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3683.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The kids that are bullied do nothing wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3686.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We should take a stance against the kids that don't want to be there, that are harmful to our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3692.186s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to take a stand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3693.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So as a parent, I'll do everything I can to make sure that my voice is heard as well, Nicole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3699.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is horrific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3702.33s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I saw the video, it's disgusting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3706.272s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That is the parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3707.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a city council, I will tell you, we have no grounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3709.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We truly have no grounds that this is, you know, unless when it comes to the budget meeting, we talked to the superintendent, because it seems like that's the only time we seem to get any information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3720.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because unfortunately, we found out as a council through the newspaper, through the TVs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3729.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wasn't notified, and I'm sure most of my fellow councils weren't notified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3735.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's very difficult when we don't get information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3737.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have to hear from newspapers and stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3739.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's frustrating in itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3741.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But that's what I'm frustrated as a city councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3744.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a parent of a child at Medford High School, I'm appalled that this is still going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3748.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My daughter was there and watched the situation occur right in front of her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3752.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And she was horrified for this family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3754.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Horrified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3756.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so were all their classmates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3757.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But you know what they're told to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3759.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Keep their mouth shut, sit on their hands, because they're afraid that they're the next people to be bullied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3764.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, that's not the way to live.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3766.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I remember one person stood up and looked me right in the eye and said, say something, see something, say something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3772.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, we're seeing plenty, and we're doing nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3776.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please, if there's anything that the school committee that's on tonight or the city administration that's going to hear this, please,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3786.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: work with the school administration, work with those great teachers, because that's the other thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3791.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We went out and got us... We heard that there was a study done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3797.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's great that we did a study, but we wasted money, the city's money, on bringing someone in from the outside when we could have just asked the teachers, great teachers that know exactly what's going on and what we need to fix.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3810.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one's asked them that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3814.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Instead, I'm getting phone calls from teachers that they're afraid to stand up because they're wiping blood off their clothes, off their bodies, because they just broke up another fight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3825.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, Nicole, again, I don't want to revert and take this away from your points that you made, but I tell you, as a parent, I'm standing with you, and I'll do whatever needs to be done as a parent to make sure that your child is safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3840.016s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's absolutely no reason why your daughter has to fear and put her head down at night knowing that she has to get up in the morning to go to Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3848.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In no way in the world should you and your family think of trying to figure out how you can break the bank to try to figure out to move your daughter to a different school system just because this is happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3859.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I condemn that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3860.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3863.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if what we can do is we can ask the city administration, I will tell you, Nicole, I do not support AP law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3872.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know what we're paying for this community and paying them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3875.477s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't know what it would be a charge to this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3878.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But right now, I'm at the point where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3880.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No charge right now would be too small, too large.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3883.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to get assistance for this family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3885.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If she's not getting the information she needs by law of the timetable, then someone needs to assist her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3891.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And obviously when I talk to Nicole,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3894.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She wanted to come here to see if anybody and I explained to her that we don't have a city solicitor No one really can answer you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3900.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know this is going to get back to the superintendent I know that there's commitments on this on this call, please Somebody get mrs. Branley the information that she needs so sure and her daughter and her family could rest every day, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3913.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4678.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4681.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just, I know I'm breaking in and out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4683.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we really, this doesn't matter on what we, we don't have a vote on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4688.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that what I just heard?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4689.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4710.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4711.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I think that this is important because I know when this first came out and there were departments that were left out and chief Friedman fire or one of the departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4719.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm glad to see that we're moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4721.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't something I would, I would vote against, but, uh, there are some concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4726.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that, um, uh, I know there's some it issues that are coming up and we don't have an it department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4732.814s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't know what,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4734.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what we're doing to get that into place, and then some other concerns that I have with the recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4741.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if I take it again, it really doesn't matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4746.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But hey, thanks for the input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4749.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4751.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thanks, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5254.316s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5255.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And thank you, Mr. Sullivan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5257.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't realize that was your capacity to work with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5259.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm glad to see that we're using your expertise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5262.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, this is what I was I was asking to same thing that the same grounds as Council beers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5269.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that you said that we can add this to our budget, Mr. Silva.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5274.209s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the problem, my friend, we don't know what the budget is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5279.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I understand that we have this ARPA money right now for these jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5284.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when you look at what we're looking with the fire department, and as much as I don't like the traffic and parking, you're talking about something tangible that's going to be fixed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5294.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we're looking at our IT department, this will support something right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5302.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if we don't have enough staff, we don't have a budget that'll<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5307.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: um, withstand, um, the concerns that I'm saying are what the mayor had mentioned last year during the budget season that, um, you know, that we're going to, we're going to be looking at some dire situations again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5319.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is this right now putting money into something that as much as we need it, and I agree with you, we do need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5326.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, is it going to be putting it to something that then we can't man.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5333.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that don't have the funding to staff and not having someone at the other end to answer at that IT desk for that support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5343.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, and we just haven't seen anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5347.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been saying this at every meeting until we have an understanding of what our budget looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5352.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what I'm afraid of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5354.048s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know we weren't I was I was the same same type of situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5356.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about the 3 1 1 you know unveiling years ago that we said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5362.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said it myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5363.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said how how do we have a 3 1 1 system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5366.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have the infrastructure in place to support that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5369.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is what I'm afraid that this is not 3 1 1 system all over again because we're starting to put money into situations and different processes that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5378.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know budgetarily if we can even support that in the next budget cycle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5384.842s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is what I'm fearful of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5388.264s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So just thank you for listening to my concerns, but that's what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5395.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5446.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5447.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I thank you for the, for the, uh, the knowledge that you're sharing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5450.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just, like I said, I'm just, you know, what was left in, in June was the comment that was resonating that it's going to be so bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5459.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, is it going to be so bad that the mayor says we need to take this money out of the communication line to support fire police?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5467.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's, that's what I'm fearful of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5469.148s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but thank you for your input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5471.289s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5518.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5520.051s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=5521.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would recommend the table if she's not, if there isn't a representative, not a president, her point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6593.183s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, I just want to clarify that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6595.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate Jim, you know, giving us the information that we needed with that but I just wanted to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6601.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: directors to chief Friedman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6603.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I, I, it's not that I don't think that this is an important endeavor that Jim has presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6609.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand that data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6611.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'm concerned in is not understanding our budget and how the longevity of the sustainability for whatever we're using our ARPA funding for can be sustained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6623.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would hate to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6626.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh during sitting in budget season you sitting across from us and saying we're talking about closing you know a fire station god forbid or or losing firemen and women because we don't have in our budget we don't know what the ramifications are in our budget so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6641.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not that I don't think that this isn't a great idea, because I think this is an amazing idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6647.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is exactly where you should be in a community that can handle the sustainability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6654.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know where we are financially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6657.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just want the chief to know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6659.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that he jumped in and wanted to defend this amazing process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6664.035s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I agree with him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6665.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, without us seeing the budget numbers, without seeing our finances right now, without understanding where we're going, anything that's not sustainable, that has to be sustained, excuse me, through our general budget, I think it lends to fear in my eyes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6681.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if, you know, God, if this was the case, why aren't we funding, you know, the teachers' raises with it then?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6687.584s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why are we securing, you know, these are the concerns that we have, that everybody has, that we don't have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6694.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the funding to sustain this after the ARPA is gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6697.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that it's just the same question, just in a different area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6701.071s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just want people to understand that this, I agree with Mr. Silver.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6704.494s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's something that it sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6707.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And most functioning communities have unbelievable ID departments like he's talking about that have a high have helped us that all we have to do is send it, send a request to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6717.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's, it's beneficial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6719.666s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6720.186s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6721.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My fear, again, I'm going to say this all the way until the budget season, because we still have yet to see anything dealing with our finances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6730.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And in my own home, my father taught me, you can't spend what you don't have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6737.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why we have a checkbook, that we follow the guidance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6739.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In today's world, we have online banking, so we can follow that every single day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6745.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not going to cut a check for $2,000 if I only have $1,500 in the account, everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6750.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what we don't have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6751.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are the basic understandings of finances that we don't have right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6755.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can't see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6756.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I know I'm winded, but I just wanted Chief Friedman to understand that that's where I was coming with that comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6763.913s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6878.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Chief, that's exactly what I'm saying, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6880.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're saying that you can see savings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6883.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can't, because we don't have a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6886.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have finance paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6890.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6891.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not saying you can see that in your budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6894.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a city councilor, we don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6895.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have any information budget-wise, financial-wise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6899.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6900.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6963.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if I can shut off some of these other bills, which again, I've, I've supported everything that when it comes to fight upon, especially communication, because we realize how, how we're in the dinosaur age and I completely understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6977.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I agree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6978.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I support this a thousand percent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6980.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All I'm saying is my fear is without knowing the finances, guys, that's, that's all really I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6986.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't, I don't disagree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6987.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's, it's something I find women need for their safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6991.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I agree with you a thousand percent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6993.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mzAfWK2luWc&t=6495.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Reaching out, touching me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=825.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hi Madam President, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=828.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I'm gonna stand with my previous stance that anything we do with any money papers have to be halted until we get definition of questions we've asked that clearly affect our decisions moving forward financially in hopes that we understand what the forecast looks like moving into the next budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=858.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: don't know what's going on financially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=859.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe our finance director has already stressed that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=863.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's too much going on right now to get a hold of it, a hold on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=866.92s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then again, we have our union representation in the audience again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=874.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, when this room is full with all of our union members, everybody stands tall about these money papers, making sure we're showing the true support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=884.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Every penny that goes out, making sure that you handle the people that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=889.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: have been working without a contract and are at a stalemate right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=894.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And until that's done, I will not vote on any money paper moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=898.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is something I will not support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=901.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=903.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: anything dealing with salaries, especially when we have questions out there that haven't been answered, that we've been waiting for a legal response from that gave us guidance, whether that, you know, what we've done and what the mayor has done in the past and city administration's done in the past with upgrades and not getting a true understanding if it was done, when it was done without our knowledge, was it against our own city ordinances, which we believe they were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=930.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=933.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a trend, unless we figure out a way to stop it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=939.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I also understand the other side of this, saying that we can't move forward unless we have these positions in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=945.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=945.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There aren't too many offices full anyway in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=949.187s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it seems like we're just piecemealing things and nothing is really truly happening to support our union brothers and sisters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=958.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=2197.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can't imagine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=2199.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=2199.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: While you're here, Chris and talk about the football team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=2202.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, what I find amazing is we're talking method.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=2206.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maldon football game and its history and how much pride that we have is former Mustangs and what it means to everybody in Medford that that whether new or old, understanding how old this game is and what it means to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=2220.289s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=2221.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I also wanted I've noticed something that I haven't seen in a long time here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=2227.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, the football team were raking leaves this past weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=2232.766s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=2295.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, that's my point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=2296.584s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that what we're saying is, I know you brought up the record, but eliminate the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=2302.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: huge number of kids now, I think it's 60, 70 kids that are playing football.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=2306.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have, we have, if you see them, it's volunteering at all the recreation events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=2312.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You see them volunteering at raking, raking people's yards and needs assistance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=2317.115s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You see them when, uh, push pulling on the pushing for their, their, um, pro other programs, whether it's a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=2324.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: whether it's a show in the school or whether it's another athletic event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=2328.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I give our Medford Mustangs a lot of credit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=2331.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's truly what it's really meant to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=2334.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The old days of, you know, the jocks having some sort of persona.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=2341.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I commend our, that stigma has now disappeared, at least in my eyes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=2346.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we are one big family at Medford High School and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=2350.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think what keeps them together right now, especially through tough times, are the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=2354.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, the kids have really stood strong with each other and got them through some tough times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=2359.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I commend Coach Curley and your organization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=2395.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, God, I just remember that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=2396.52s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Actually, we traded right before Thanksgiving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=2398.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=2399.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Coach Pierre took a penalty shot on the soccer field, and I took a hand off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=2404.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think Chris lit me up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=2631.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Chris doesn't have much passion for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=2692.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, if I can, I know that Justin and I already decided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=2696.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm gonna paint an M, Justin's gonna be the E. If anybody'd like to join us to fill in the rest of the Metro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=2703.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll see, Justin, we'll see, we're fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=2720.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, thanks, Chris.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=2723.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3139.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I know that I talked to City Clerk this evening, and the fire was put out by our meeting, and I thank you, Council President, for putting that through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3155.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This business will not be what is feared to be a pawn shop, so with that part of the record,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3162.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We would have special conditions to this special permit that this this will be allowed only to sell used and new phones and uses a repair shop for only phones, tablets and computers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3180.563s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With those stipulations that would go with the with the permit and, um, stay with the person that, um, that has petitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3190.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3190.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3406.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3407.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate Councilor Villes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3409.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: comments, I think they are important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3411.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, it brings us back to where are we going to be once we see these numbers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3421.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My fear is once we start to see these numbers and we see the dire fiscal emergency we'll be in, you're talking about a position that will probably be gone in three months anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3433.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the first thing you're going to do is start<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3438.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: letting go of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3440.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's all that I can think of because of the lack of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3448.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We were bleeding last year, and we pushed through in the final minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3453.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for our budget last year, and I don't see any new growth, I don't see anything that shows us financially that we'll be stable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3463.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, it's putting in a position that's going to get somebody ready to go, in a position to support what we need, which in turn<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3474.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've been waiting, and we've started a dialogue with bringing in a representative, legal representative, hopefully Attorney Hrabowski to help us with the zoning, continue with our zoning information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3487.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna be in the same situation that this person's gonna work for a few months and then they're gonna be let go because we can't sustain their position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3495.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's my fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3497.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is why I can't vote for any money paper because I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3502.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what we're going to do is we're gonna vote for a position that right now is pretty, it's not secure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3509.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's open, I know the money's there, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3513.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What's gonna happen in a few months when we finally get paperwork that shows that we're in dire straits and we're looking at teachers, we're looking at fire, we're looking at policemen, we're looking at custodians, you're looking at paraprofessionals, you're looking at city hall staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3530.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the only thing that I fear, putting the next few months into someone's position and then letting them go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3537.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There isn't a clear dialogue, that's what I'm trying to get at right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3541.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have a clear vision of what our budget's going to look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3544.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we keep putting money and putting these caps through and putting these upgrades, trying to keep putting these upgrades in, the uncertainty is so clear that all we're going to be doing is hiring people right now and approving positions that are gonna serve as time cost and time wasted because it'll be time to move forward past these people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3571.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what I fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3572.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So with that, like again, I said, I cannot support any money position right now without a clear understanding what our financial and fiscal weaknesses and strengths are moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3587.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, we have teachers, you saw what happened in Malden yesterday, work to rule, I believe our teachers already started work to rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3597.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Melrose, excuse me, I think our teachers already did that without the fanfare.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3601.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But, and we haven't heard anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3603.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's been no movement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3605.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, we haven't heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3606.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's, it's, you know, firemen as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3609.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's, it's been, you know, a lot more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3611.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So until we get a true understanding what's happening financial in this community, I can't support any money paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3618.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I, I believe me, I, I,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3620.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand my fellow Councilors and their vision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3624.142s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it makes a lot of sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3626.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that on the other side, this is where I stand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3631.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I just appreciate the conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3634.016s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=273.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=274.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=275.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just a question on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=278.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that some companies have reached out and residents reached out that just wanted to replace their water mains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=286.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that Councilor Knight brought this forward with this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=289.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why I'm bringing it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=290.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we now having the companies now go curb to curb whenever they open the street?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=345.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll disagree with you there, just for the fact that what I did prior to your arrival, I had asked for a list back at least, I believe, two or three years on openings, approvals for openings, and who did those and who did the paving and did they do,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=367.233s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a just partial or complete or just a block.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=371.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it was comical because when I got back, I got list of the addresses for the small businesses in the residential homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=381.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I use one example, Tufts is one of the biggest companies we use for residential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=386.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you have Tufts paving or construction, whatever it's called, and then it says the address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=392.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then, so you can understand when we wanted that to see if the paving was done to specs of what we were told was gonna be acceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=400.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But anything that had to do with our utilities, it was just basic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=407.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't know the address, we didn't know, it was actually useless for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=413.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think I'll ask that again down the line, because I think I'm gonna call for a special meeting for this for the fact that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=420.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, personally, on my end, the reason why I brought this up, High Street, at 10 o'clock at night, we had a utility job that the public utility hired an outside company to come in and repave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=434.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, they came in at 10 o'clock at night on a school night and, you know, it was, they said they had permission from the entity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=442.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that- Are you on a public way or a private way?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=445.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm in a public way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=457.613s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=459.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The answer you gave is just a little alarming that our utilities have gone above and beyond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=465.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe that's what you said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=466.539s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think they've done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=467.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As I said, it's a public utility company and they kind of have their own guidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=472.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know, and what I'm saying is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=474.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: those guidelines we have to find a way to change them because if you look at our roads a lot of it has to do with i'm not saying it's your fault this is not your fault this is years of of mismanagement of our roadway roadways that you know this is why these questions are coming up from council night that's why we appreciate you being here so thank you understand thank you very much any further questions for the council at this time<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=683.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Merle?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=685.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=686.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=688.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I propose a table this motion for the fact that in the past, just so the constituents know that especially people here in the chambers, when we have a question or concerns with legal background, city council usually has a city solicitor or assistant city solicitor that works with us to answer any questions that legally that we need to make sure that wherever we vote, we vote either as for or against that we are doing it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=719.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with the proper form and not holding the city liable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=724.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll give you an example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=725.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This council voted on a gas station to exclude a gas station for BJ's about a year ago, and we didn't have council here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=736.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the reason for it was illegal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=739.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So BJ's took us to court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=742.92s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and we were found to be in fault and it would have been a serious, it could have been if our acting solicitor at the time worked with BJ's to make sure that we had some language and understanding what the protocol was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=759.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I tabled these, anything that you're gonna see with legal, I'll be honest with the city administration to all my constituents that anything with legal notification<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=771.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't feel comfortable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=772.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not, I don't have a legal background.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=774.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want to make sure that I cross my T's and dot my I's when it comes to certain entities that we're not putting our decisions on putting a financial burden on our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=787.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: committee or community to fight a legal battle that we're going to lose because we weren't informed properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=793.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's the reason that I asked because it's, you know, we asked a certain a few questions, one being that if there are 50 to 60 cars that are going to be housed in Medford,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=805.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who is going to, where are they going to be housed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=808.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are they going to pay excise tax?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=810.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At least will we get the tax revenue from that excise tax?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=815.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe the answer was that we will from Lyft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=818.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want to make sure from our legal team, I wanted to ask that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=821.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's some other questions, but I know that there was KP Law was supposed to be, is supposed to be here online tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=830.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to just, we can ask them some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=832.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that making sure that, you know, opening this up, I want to get some examples in the city that where this is similar to, so we can all understand on its basis, what it entails.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=847.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we don't put ourselves by allowing this and then later opening up an issue that because of past practice, we might be doing something that's going to harm our community later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=860.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If that's the question for our legal representation here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1159.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You would, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1161.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1163.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1164.981s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is, like I said, this is our concern as a council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1168.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In the past, I appreciate the council from KP Law coming in and stating our ordinance that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1176.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We read also what our city solicitor used to do is work with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1182.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and help us understand past practice, what we've done with past businesses and how that negatively affected our community with our decision or the impact on how we can present it that is legal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1198.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I tabled it for the fact that we don't have a city solicitor that's working with us because I asked what I really wanted to know is to give us some examples that we as a council can,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1212.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: can see tangible comparisons that we've done in the past that have both helped and then crippled us in a sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1221.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you look at this situation, I personally have a concern with traffic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1227.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're talking about 50, 60 cars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1229.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If anybody's in that area, I know what the comment was from the company that we spoke with last week that said, oh no, they won't use the satellite program next to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1242.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in the Fellsway Plaza, they're going to park over at a parking lot in a parking garage across the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1251.223s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know what the proper answer is and what the safe answer is as a city councilor that doesn't have a background in legal jargon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1261.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I can't vote for this or support it for the fact that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1271.041s">[Scarpelli]</a>: leaving it to table, not to the fact that right now I don't have an answer for it, whether it's a yes or no for this permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1283.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't have an answer because I don't have any support from a city solicitor that I have in the past worked with to help me make these decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1294.272s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1296.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope I'm making sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1300.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know where I'm going to go I'd like to hear from my fellow Councilors before we make some motions, but I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1583.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, if I wanted or not, these are great questions debate, sitting with a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1594.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: no offense to Attorney Blake, but this is what I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1598.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're having an open debate about something that we should be talking about with our solicitor, making sure we get the questions answered correctly for the councils that have the opportunity to sit with former city solicitors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1612.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I do not forget what we've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1613.922s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what I implore you to understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1617.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is not about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1619.747s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, whether I want to hinder a business to prosper in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1626.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We definitely have questions, and I appreciate Attorney Blake coming and answering questions, but the questions are our ordinance that we know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1637.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so this isn't a strategy to understand for or against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1644.351s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's where we could understand with a city solicitor sitting in our community, working with us as a partner, figuring this out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1653.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I'm going to say no disrespect to KP law, but I don't see them as a partner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1658.261s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They are an employee for administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1662.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, thank you for time, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1900.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate Councilor Bears bringing it forward because, you know, with my hesitation, I would have tabled it, but if moving it toward a Committee of the Whole meeting where we have legal representation that if we had to adjourn in a confidential<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1921.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: know, manner of like we have in the past with our city solicitor that I would feel more comfortable to understanding our process and that format.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1929.911s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, I know you have questions before me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1933.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Anybody else might have questions before I motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1936.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that that's a good idea to send this community holds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2414.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Turning, turning over new ownership and the business is going to stay the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2419.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was saying the same, same employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2423.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2423.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is great because I know that we might, we found out that when we were closed, it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2430.169s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was around Christmas time, I think, and it was devastating for us, because it's easy for a lazy husband to buy his jewelry at once, and the quality's phenomenal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2439.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate your business, your respect to our community, and I see everything in order, Madam President, so I will move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2483.362s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2485.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for being here this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2486.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, this is similar to the conversation I'm having with Lyft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2489.805s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a new business, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2491.105s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2492.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I do have some questions that I really needed to be answered by a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2498.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that this would fall in the same category if you, you know, if you persuade me differently but I just want you to be aware it's not personal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2506.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not I have questions but I don't have the person to answer them just yet so maybe we can add this to the, the, the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2560.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, well, Mr. Costas did a lot with audio.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2572.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2574.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2576.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I, again, so the questions I would have is, you know, moving forward, what can be sold as, you know, what's titled the, where is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2588.423s">[Scarpelli]</a>: secondhand articles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2589.824s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's, that's what the question that I need answered, then what is second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2594.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we grant this petition, and the business falls through, it would start with cell phones, then all of a sudden, no disrespect to you, then we have chainsaws and, and power tools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2605.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so these are the questions that I have with our city solicitor, making sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2611.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know that it fits the neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2612.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so I think that's important so I would, I would ask the table this and reference this again at the committee the whole meeting if that's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2620.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2622.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2631.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2633.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to make this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2635.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to drag this out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2636.518s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want to make sure that we have answered the questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2639.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if those questions are acceptable, that we move forward and have you open and prosper here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2645.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just want to make sure we do our due diligence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2647.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please forgive me that I'm delaying this a little bit, but I want to make sure we have the right questions answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2659.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so maybe we could, you know, set a separate one maybe before the meeting next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2664.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know you have a busy schedule, Madam President, but I don't think this, it's just a few questions that we really need to solicit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2670.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why adding it there, it wouldn't take long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2673.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if we can have a committee of the whole meeting just to answer some of these questions and give us some guidance as we move forward, maybe a separate meeting for that, that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2682.297s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Legal please, I think legal is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2758.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2760.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see that Icon Motors is actually still, if we can, if Mr. Marciano can tell us that it's, the business is still staying the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2772.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2772.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it's just the ownership is, you're now gonna be the sole owner, I know it was Partners, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2782.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right new corporation in order to have that I need to apply for the new license under the icon name Okay, and so just changing the icon to icon and I know that um, I know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2794.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: hope the practices stay the same and your support to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2798.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know you've been very active with our youth organizations and donating and being active as a member of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2804.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that a lot of people from Medford work for you and we appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2808.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I know that there was one concern I think that I mentioned to you that the parking off street, I know that you have a big lot, but I think the concerns whenever, you know, that especially not as much on Mystic Ave, but as the parking of,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2823.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: vehicles on the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2826.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Does that happen too often?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2827.949s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it something that we're gonna make sure that we can keep an eye on that and make sure that it's under control and we're not taking advantage of that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2835.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2836.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think I see everything in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2838.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's another well-run, respectable entity here in this community and I would support to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3121.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3324.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is 55,032 weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3327.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what would be the full full salary for full year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3365.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She will not go from the 13 to a 12.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3369.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What is the salary of that position for a full year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3385.351s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we still have that position that if that person moves up, they deserve that money, obviously, but I opposed and I tabled for the fact that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3401.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This council has openly talked about what we've been saying, what have we been asking for, and we haven't getting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3409.016s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So unfortunately, until we see some movement where we have our unions that are coming to us that haven't had a contract, and we have some caps that were approved that we're still waiting on answers that we never approved, and then asking for money papers that we've asked for,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3430.532s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for, I don't know, Councilor, Councilor Mejia years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3434.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll get to that in my speech.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3435.233s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm waiting to see with this situation, I'm gonna stand strong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3441.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand, I respect Councilor Beaz's conversation with how important this is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3450.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I agree, I think we need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3451.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think we don't need it, but right now, I don't think that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3456.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We keep saying yes to all what's asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3460.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We are just a rubber stamp.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3465.18s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need answers, questions answered for us, for this question, to give us strength.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3471.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We keep voting yes, until they understand that no, we're not gonna vote on anything until we have a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3478.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, that we can't vote on money papers till there's respect for other unions or positions that haven't been filled yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3486.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have positions in the city hall that haven't been filled that are vital positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3491.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is adding another position that we already have a director and we have an assistant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3497.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So at least it's stable right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3500.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're voting on something and moving more money to an entity that at least is stable in our stable definition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3510.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is why I can't support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3511.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing personal, I know how you work and I know how your team is working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3516.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, this is fundamentally wrong to ask this until we have the entities in place that we can get answers, because we're not getting answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3605.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So Madam President, I appreciate that, but not just city solicitor, but I'm talking about other empty directors positions that we've had in a long time here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3616.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That is some serious concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3618.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I understand, I appreciate you sharing that with us with city solicitor, because I understand that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3622.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But like I said, there are other major needs that if we had to move, you know, CAF money around, I would rather move CAF money around to make sure we can bring in a qualified, you know, experienced city assessor or a qualified IT director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3641.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what I'm saying to my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3644.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you need, if this is where we need to move some money to make sure we have it, this is where it should be needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3650.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right now, I don't think we have the stability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3654.372s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in other locations to be approving capital, approving $88,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3658.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we, you know, you want to talk about hurting, let's talk to those teachers that haven't gotten a contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3665.099s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's talk about the fire and they're hurting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3668.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5636.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5636.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thanks, Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5638.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think you hit the nail on the head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5639.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Steve is just all I can say is that anytime you talk to Steve, even if you just pass Steve and walk past Steve and passing and driving by him, he had the most calming, peaceful, welcoming face that you can ever have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5657.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he's someone that is definitely missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5659.766s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's truly one of the good guys in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5665.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: condolences to his family, he will be missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8700.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Obviously it's affected people, so I think going to that body, the traffic commission, and then you obviously have support that, like Councilor Behr said, is now<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8714.827s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This, unfortunately, it was done right, embedded, everybody has a voice now, it has to be turned and divide the community and say, hey, now it's us versus you because we weren't notified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8728.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, unfortunately, and I apologize for that, but that's terrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8732.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8834.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8835.681s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I do not want to at any time disrespect our colleagues on the school committee side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8841.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think everybody has watched the news about the horrific attack on that young lady, a sophomore at Medford High School and the phone calls I've been getting and the conversation I've been having with Medford High School students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8864.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and not having the knowledge of what happened or how we can direct our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8870.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: young people for support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8872.739s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, we have kids that we have students that have come to me and said that they're afraid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8877.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, they're legitimately afraid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8879.805s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're talking about going to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8881.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've I've talked to teachers that have involved in fights that are horrified and frightened to go to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8888.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when you see that, it's just another slap in the face and disrespect of this community that you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8894.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have a marine<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8896.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: recruiter breaking up a fight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8898.794s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, uh, which leads to, um, questions we had with the superintendent about security.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8905.437s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They said they had security from now what I was told, you know, that the questions that is not being communicated correctly, and that's where the communication comes in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8913.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that they're more like door monitors and, um, and something has to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8921.424s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, this is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8923.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, not only because I have a child here, but I talked to, I was at a recent school event that when I tell you former students and athletes that I've coached have come up to me and said, coach, we're scared, it's scary up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8938.855s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And Smithford High School, that's a place to go where you're gonna be safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8943.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And not having the understanding of what I could tell them, because in normal cases,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8950.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: situations when there is an issue this big.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8953.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're informed that anybody here was anybody else, maybe I missed it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8988.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, the situation is, and the resolution is, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8993.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How do we find a ground with this communication that when we get the phone calls from parents and students that are asking for assistance and help, where do we direct them to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9003.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because they don't feel comfortable in what they're seeing and what paths that have happened so far and who they can reach out to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9014.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They feel alone and they're scared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9019.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if anybody, if you didn't see the video,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9022.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wish you not look at the video because it's gonna change your life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9025.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's disgusting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9027.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9199.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Madam President, just I think more importantly, I know that the intent is really to have the understanding that the students are so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9214.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: custom to situations that have happened in the past, whether it was the issue last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9220.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now what happened with this situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9223.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think they're a little bit lost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9227.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'd like to know what the what this school administration is going to do to make the rest of the school feel like they're safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9239.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, I know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9240.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that the communication to us, the most important pieces is from the school department to say, you know, this is what's going on, but asking, having an avenue that we can have the kids talk to the guidance councils or, you know, their, you know, teachers they feel comfortable with, because whenever they're, especially when I was on the school committee, the understanding that something big happened,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9271.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the first thing we did is rallied around the students that were impacted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9275.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this, for instance, is all of our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9278.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I asked if there was assemblies, how were the students notified?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9285.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How are they feeling safe?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9290.202s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They haven't been addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9294.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: from what I've been told.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9295.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe it's different, but from what I've been told, they haven't been addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9298.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we need to stop listening to our children, listen to our students, because they were frightened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9308.316s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I don't wanna be a dead horse, but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=721.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=721.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for my fellow counsel putting this forward as a first generation American who has a very deep and proud tradition of our Italian culture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=731.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate bringing this forward, but I will tell you to say that the Italian American community isn't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=740.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is still a little unhappy in our community, not because of a name change of a school, but because of the discussions of not following through with really celebrating an Italian American and making sure that our community wasn't forgotten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=759.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's something that I appreciate my colleagues bringing this resolution forward so we can mention it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=765.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate Councilor Knight and Councilor Caraviello for that initiative they did put through a year and a half ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=770.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I guess if it's not forefront in the news, it's really not a true issue in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=777.159s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's disheartening for Councilor Caraviello<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=784.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: person like myself that parents came to this country from Italy to make make their their roots to settle their roots and look at follow the American dream.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=795.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And and Medford has done that for sure for my family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=800.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're very fortunate that my mom and dad have now passed on but left us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=807.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We leave them at the thanks of everything they've done for us and how they taught us to work hard and really have pride in who we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=816.716s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that, I just hope this community and this administration follows through what they're saying and what we talked about just a few short years ago, because it seems like it's a culture that is easily forgotten where one time<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=836.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the Italian culture and the Irish culture in this community built it for what it is today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=840.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why so many people love this great city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=841.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2528.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, and thank you, Mr. Pierre, for coming out and let us know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2533.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, my recommendation, if we can have our code enforcement officer there on a daily basis, because money talks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2541.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So every time we see a violation, we should be taking these violations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2546.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if it happens three, four times a day, then they should be taken three, four times a day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2551.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like Councilor Knight said, it's getting frustrating for us<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2555.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that when you talk, try to have a conversation or work together with these bigger companies, falls on deaf ears and it's frustrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2565.756s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think if we can make a recommendation that we ask a code enforcement officer to make, you know, two trips a day and, you know, really have a pipeline that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2579.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Purifori can call them directly, and when you see and hear a violation, that we call them right away and they come right over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2587.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've had issues with something as simple as a construction project going on in Fulton Street that we had neighbors, trucks were parking on the sidewalk, kids were trying to walk to school, so we set it up that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2600.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The constituents that saw something, they called me, I called the code enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2604.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: After the fourth ticket, there hasn't been a truck parked on Fulton Street on the sidewalk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2609.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that if this is how you have to do it, this is how we have to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2615.264s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's frustrating, but it's the only way that I see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2618.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've asked him to come in to talk to him, his partners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2623.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And between BJ's and Budweiser, there really hasn't been much of a partnership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2628.191s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can do that, that'd be something that I would recommend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2631.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3241.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information, correct me if I'm wrong, I believe the conversation we had with the administration was a new growth was 1.8 million and 1.2 was directly from fees and fines of, so I think it's public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3256.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that from what we were told back in those meetings that this is a process to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3264.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: raise revenue for our community, which is disheartening to me, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3755.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3755.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for coming out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3757.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I sense your frustration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3761.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: since our last meeting, talking about traffic and parking since we had the director on for a half hour to answer questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3768.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've had about 30 phone calls and emails.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3770.999s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People have called me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3772.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One thing we've recommended that maybe we stop, we reset, we educate both the enforcement officers and the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3782.805s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that that's what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3787.096s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a responsible community does when you're unveiling such a huge, impactful scenario like traffic enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3797.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, to say that we don't need the sticker anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3800.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are questions we had to ask, too, and we were cut short, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3803.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't realize I know that Councilor Morell did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3806.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: President Morell did a great job even getting the director here just for, you know, a half hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3812.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we were told what before the meeting that she was leaving at seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3817.69s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And after her 30-minute presentation of a presentation she sent us, and then listening to just a few people, there's so many questions still need to be answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3826.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is frustrating for everyone, yourself, us, because we don't know what to tell you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3833.18s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what the sad piece is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3837.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't blame the traffic enforcement officers that they hired, because it's not their fault either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3842.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, when you have three people on the road in the city that met with size and they added all of these residential streets and sidewalks and streets and roadways and said, okay, now let's police those areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3854.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's impossible to get to Marion street in a daily basis, let alone a weekly basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3858.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So maybe it is wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3860.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe they don't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3862.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had a resident come up and tell us that they ticketed 40 tickets on one street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3866.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when they asked the question of what problem was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3870.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They gave them the wrong street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3871.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They weren't even on their street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3874.29s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They named a street that has a car wash on it and that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3878.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that just tells you the frustration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3881.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know I get a phone call from a resident said that they were actually, they were enlightened that the enforcement officer came down the street and gave warnings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3894.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We asked, instead of giving the ticket, why don't you just give a warning so they can, the residents can be proactive and correct the situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3902.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the director, I believe the director said what, that the dogs would attack them if they get out of the car and gave a warning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3911.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I guess that dogs are very scared of tickets, just like us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3914.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they won't attack with the tickets, but with the warning, they won't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3919.756s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The resident called me, said he had a conversation with the gentleman that came out and said, well, the director said that she was not going to give warnings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3928.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they said, that's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3929.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we were all in the meeting saying, I'm a little confused because the dog doesn't know how to wag the tail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3935.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's getting frustrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3937.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and again, I will call, I would love to call another meeting, a Committee of the Whole meeting where we bring city administration, a traffic enforcement director back out in front of us to answer some of these questions that still have yet to be answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3951.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, you know, the situation at St.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3953.183s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Joe's, if it wasn't for Ricky's phone call and reaching out and getting everybody involved, they'd be meters there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3962.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and people be getting ticket and towed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3964.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's a lot of questions still have to be answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3967.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a lot of concerns in this community about a traffic program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3971.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3973.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wish I had an answer for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3975.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My recommendation again would be to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3979.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: review, do an audit of all of these concerns that we have with our residents, with the director and her team, to see what we can do to mitigate any future concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3990.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I can't imagine how bad this is going to be once we have to park on one side of the street or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3997.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And how are they going to enforce this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4000.509s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's going to be a real scary winter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4004.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, this is just a prelude to what we're seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4006.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I wish we could do more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4009.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We feel your frustration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4012.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, all we can do is, you know, maybe ask for another meeting with the director, because it seems to be that that's the only person that can answer our questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4025.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, it wasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4026.065s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4026.766s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we told them that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4028.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And Council President worked her tail off just to make sure that she was here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4032.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it floored us when we heard that we have a half hour and there were 30 people waiting to talk about some, you know, just to get an answer, just like you did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4040.714s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4041.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And unfortunately, you're here today to express that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4044.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we can't really give you the answer that good or bad, because at least we can have closure if there was someone that could give us something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4052.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't have much faith you get that phone call, by the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4055.466s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I apologize for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4057.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I would really try to call the communications department, the mayor's office, chief of staff, and ask their guidance on who you should call, because you've obviously tried the numbers that were there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4066.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that would be my recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4069.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4069.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4070.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4070.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4794.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: could we do it as a resolution next week?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4797.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll do it on the ice cream truck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4798.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll do it on the ice cream truck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4799.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are other items on parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4817.839s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We do have community participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4819.34s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have a source.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4820.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we have a resident that wants to come up and speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4921.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I think that that's whenever we're doing, we made sure, especially with the problems we've had with the rodents, that there should be some mitigation in the agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4929.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So unfortunately, we can't do it because of public participation, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4934.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we could do is file a resolution next week to have all the city departments, the health commissioner and our city engineer that oversees the project to look into making sure that there's some whatever's in place needs to be in place and then and shared with the council so we can get back to you and your neighbors so they they can know something's being done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4956.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4957.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: again especially when you do we talked about this whenever the roads are being open we know that we're going to have uh a manifestation of rodents and that's why we made sure we put those uh those those uh plans in place to mitigate that so hopefully we can remedy that for you but thanks for coming up and sharing that Mr. Chubbs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4977.372s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5039.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Larry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5039.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, wait a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5042.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe something will come out of the sky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5061.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're still under suspension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5078.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know I still have one on the on the suspension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5080.792s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I know that we have our director here that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5085.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: under unfinished business 22-466 our loan order for water meters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5090.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's up for its third reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5091.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can move that along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5113.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5119.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5179.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We could motion that we have the petitioner give a brief synopsis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7260.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure, obviously this is why it's a special permit request, but I,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7269.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: being that you're from San Francisco, you haven't seen or understand where 616 Felsway is, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7280.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so it is an absolute nightmare of a location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7285.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to add more traffic, this is why I get a little disappointed in the traffic impact reports, there's no traffic impact anticipated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7297.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now we're looking to add 50 vehicles to this process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7313.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, so this is why I'm a little confused on why put 616.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7317.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If that's the case, you said that the drivers have an opportunity to go to the 616 location for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7325.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7371.368s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and then the other location, it's a hub where they're going to be parked in the parking lot or in the garage?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7393.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So all those automobiles that'll be parked in Medford are registered through Medford in Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7405.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I mean, if we're parking 50 automobiles in our city, Medford accepts excise tax for automobiles that are parked and based in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7418.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are those 50 cars based in going to pay excise tax in our community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7431.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you have any more assurances than I believe so?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7436.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So for many different reasons, one being that we don't have a city solicitor that if I had questions that I can call to ask the legal questions dealing with this and the fact that this is something first time I've heard of this, you're looking at two locations and 50 more automobiles that will be parked in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7458.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is there a negotiation between you and the lift and the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7463.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: garage companies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7466.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is there is there an agreement between them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7478.609s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but we have an entity that's used for public parking now being used as a business entity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7485.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's now going to be over, it's gonna be, because I'm a little confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7492.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's gonna be, they're gonna be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7494.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there'll be housed there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7495.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you'll have drivers coming in and out, taking those vehicles out of that location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7501.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7503.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: then we don't know if they're going to be registered in Medford where there'd be tax in Medford and truly don't understand the impact or I know the traffic engineer isn't online, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7523.258s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We did get- Off of vehicles?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7528.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then, you know, the traffic impact, I know that is one of the most densely populated areas that I know I traverse there every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7538.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to see that adding another 50 more vehicles at a time is something that I have questions with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7543.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my personal opinion right now, until we get legal, I have, I get some legal questions that I need to ask, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7553.456s">[Scarpelli]</a>: an entity in the city that I can ask, which I don't, we don't have a solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7556.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7558.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I guess I'll have to call the mayor's office to see who can answer some of these questions legally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7564.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would recommend that we table this until we get further understanding of what this process is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7570.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that would be my recommendation, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7574.429s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That would be a motion to table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8428.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the important piece right now is very is twofold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8433.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The understanding of getting some questions answered and making sure this council at one point wasn't represented<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8441.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when there was a special permit requested by a legal team, and when we denied it for a reason that we couldn't, we were then sued.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8450.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the reason why I want to make sure that we don't do anything until we get the word from legal that one way or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8460.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know I appreciate the representative from Lyft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8463.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a lot of great questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8467.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Caraviello brings up some great points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8469.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand the benefit for taxable revenue through the excise tax, but I just want to make sure there are some questions that I have legally on our end before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8533.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my recommendation would be that now that I have these questions that I can, I would table for two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8539.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And hopefully the city administration can have someone through the legal team just answer a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8545.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll reach out to them tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8547.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my recommendation right now I don't feel comfortable to go to a vote with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8550.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it has to table for two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8786.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8788.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8790.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8792.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The intent for this format is to come through us to give a permit for a special event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8804.78s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so far, special events for, for instance, the Harvest Fest, which we would support, the fundraiser for a school,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8817.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the biggest thing we talked about over and over again, and I think everybody, everybody, including, including the mayor who sat right here when I said a thousand times, if it affects brick and mortar businesses, we shouldn't support them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8832.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8833.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there is, I don't, I still don't understand<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8836.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, let's say the META program is a huge success.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8840.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The city has rallied around it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8842.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody is super excited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8844.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna celebrate this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8845.928s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are gonna be hundreds of people here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8849.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is there anybody here to tell us, is Zach's ice cream truck going to charge the individual?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8856.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is the city picking up the fee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8859.177s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Does anybody know that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8896.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I know we're making light of this, but I'm gonna be honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8900.745s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In all seriousness, this is disappointing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8905.268s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we're joking and laughing about it, but are you kidding me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8908.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had teachers call me today because they're working to rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8912.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now that's not good for both ends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8916.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have kids that are not gonna be given the services they need because teachers are that frustrated that they're not working to rule, so when 230 hits, they're home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8926.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I understand that this is funny, but this is funny disgusting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8932.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's have an ice cream truck unveil, celebrate something we just talked about that's turning the city upside down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8941.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've had nothing but complaints and anger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8946.096s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know what, if the director will come here for four hours to discuss issues, I will vote on an ice cream truck to be parked right out here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8953.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As long as someone's right there answering the questions that I have to answer every night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8957.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm disgusted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8963.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something, I love this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8965.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I love the city, but this is becoming a laughing stock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8968.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a joke asking for ice cream.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8973.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my vote to be no, I would deny this permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9390.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, if you could, I'm gonna waive the rest of the reading and go to Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9393.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. Vice President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9395.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that this is what it's entitled for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9398.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9398.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a special event to bring the whole community together, to push an event or process that we need to really spread the word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9406.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I would support this wholeheartedly, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9411.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a method companies, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9788.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sure you had a few laughs, but this is what's difficult for me as the chairperson for signs on the subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9797.437s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that when I see something like this, I always made my first phone call to guess who?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9803.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Paul Moki, our building<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9812.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not with Paul retiring, and I know we were supposed to have a new director in place, but I haven't heard yet to ask some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9822.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, I would normally listen to Paul, and he would say, George, this is X, Y, and Z, and answer those questions, and it would be finished.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9830.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm battling right now because I don't see any...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9834.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't see any digital signs that are moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9837.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't see, you know, I know that so that the request is that we're adding more signs that are recommended and that the signs will be off at 11 o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9847.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's important now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9849.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Outside, do we have like, will you have around the parking lot enter signs or will there be anything that would distinguish people can understand that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9863.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, but it won't be anything that's illuminated or anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9865.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9866.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9867.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is what's difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9868.695s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is obviously a business that we want to support here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9874.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a very professional sign company that has done their due diligence, read through everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9882.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It looks good to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9882.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would tend to support it, but again, this is my inner battle, is that not having a building commissioner where I can get any<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9893.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: answer questions that I had and feel comfortable with my decision tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9897.745s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know if I could vote for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9899.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is why I yield to my council colleagues before I hear any other recommendations, but right now just I yield.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10686.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor say any further comments point information kind of concepts, if you can explain this a little bit more detailed at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10693.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10693.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This would be $30 household per month for internet and bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10700.666s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, this is coming through what what program is that it's a federal program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10705.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What is it, it's a federal program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10706.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10708.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's amazing, I didn't realize that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10718.92s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This should be something that, again, this is where you should be standing on top of mountains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10724.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Imagine parents understanding the difficulties they're having with Wi-Fi connections, because affordability, there's a process that we can do that on the federal side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10735.423s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's disheartening but appreciate your hard work and finding that that's a, I would second your resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10751.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, if we challenge it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10845.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10849.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: my colleague bringing this forward, I think that this, I believe, was a huge issue in the local school department that then left that school department in financial resolve because of that situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10865.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's good to see if we bring that forward, making sure that our school superintendent and school department and the governing body there that makes decisions also are informed of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10878.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this, this very important situation because we don't want to be viable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10884.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10885.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we said I would second that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10914.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Motion to adjourn please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=246.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=246.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that when I saw this, I got a phone call from Bill Jr.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=252.424s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that Mr. Carr has passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=253.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know how the family had worked to bless him with the wishes that he live and die like he lived.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=263.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he was just an amazing person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=266.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He battled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=267.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He taught his family how to live and how to live for their community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=273.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: From South Medford where the Carr family started, to West Medford and Hillside coaching Little League, to the classrooms at Medford High School and the guidance Councilor office at Medford High, Mr. Carr touched a lot of people's lives in a very positive way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=291.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I've been saying this for the years that I've been on the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=295.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're seeing too many Method legends pass on, and not enough people picking up the torch where people like Mr. Carr have left off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=305.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What he did do is he did teach his children to give back to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=309.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we know both Bill and Doug have given their lives to Medford, and they're always behind the scenes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=316.64s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You never see them a lot like Mr. Carr.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=321.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, a true Mustang, a true legend, a BC, a love of Boston College, and a person that would be missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=331.609s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that tomorrow's his wake and Thursday's his send off, and I'm sure we'll see a lot of grateful people for knowing Mr. Carr and his family, and someone that will be missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=345.177s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my condolences to the family, and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=348.859s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you have a minute, read his obituary, and it speaks volumes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=352.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And maybe, maybe if a constituent reads that and says, geez, let me pick up just a little bit of what Mr. Carr has done for our community, you can make such impacts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=364.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what he's done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=365.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So bless him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=367.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1741.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1741.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Cabrera for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1745.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you remember, the reason why years ago, when I was just a young man watching this council on TV, the biggest issues with parking in Medford is that you saw that people were using the streets, the side streets and main streets of Medford to park so they can hop on commuter buses and take parking for residents all day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1767.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that was the biggest issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1769.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now it's turned into something that I believe, during the budget hearings, we talked about new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1778.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe the majority of the new growth that is projected is coming from traffic and parking, if maybe someone correct me if I'm wrong, but from fines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1787.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's a terrible way to run your community, on the backs and the pocketbooks and the wallets of your constituents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1796.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're seeing major issues with this parking plan, and it seems like, and we'll talk about this tomorrow with the department head, but it seems like this has turned into just a moneymaker for this community, and it's for the wrong reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1810.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My recommendation is gonna be the same as Councilor Caraviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1814.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have constituents call me about this issue in Wellington, where the whole street was tagged, and when people came up to fight it, they said, we'll fix it, you just have to bring up your registration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1826.93s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the constituents said to them, well, if you could see it in your computer and everybody on this street has gotten tickets because it says it's another street, why can't you change that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1836.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because we have residents that are elderly, that find it difficult to get their way to city hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1841.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They want them to come up with their registrations, sit in an office that isn't very friendly from what I gather, and ask them to change this because they made a mistake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1852.423s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just don't understand the lack of preparation and the lack of transparency shared by this department and the lack of education that they haven't given our constituents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1866.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I hate to harp on the communities that do it right, but whenever they implement any sort of change, it's something done 10 times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1876.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's put out to the community so everybody in the community understands why these plans and these parking enforcement penalties are in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1884.186s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they're educated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1887.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I saw one of the biggest increases in fees and fines in a community where I work in that would have made you sick in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1895.47s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the way they unveiled it and the way they educated their constituents, explained to them, do you enjoy your streets getting swept twice a week?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1904.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you enjoy that we don't ask for any money for our school department, that we can give our teachers full benefits, that we can give them high salaries, that we can look at our paraprofessionals and pay $40,000?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1915.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Where do you think that's coming from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1917.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's coming from fees and fines, but it's understood by the constituents saying, well, if I made a mistake, and at least I know where that money's going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1925.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In our community, we don't know why we're getting ticketed, who's giving the tickets, do they understand how they're giving tickets,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1933.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then when someone has an issue, no one is actually talking to a person like a human being.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1938.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've had very calm residents come to me and say, Councilor Scarpelli, I've gone to the office, I've tried to peacefully just ask a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1946.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it wasn't the wrong, but I just wanted to be educated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1949.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the lack of professionalism in that office, where it was smug people, people looking you right in the eye, raising their arms over their heads and yawning in your face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1959.105s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, this is customer service at its worst.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1962.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is gonna be something that's gonna be shared tomorrow, but I've welcomed all those people that have contacted me, come to this meeting, share your thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1971.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I think we need to put a, sometimes you need to stop everything and reassess so we can educate our constituents, educate the staff that's there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1979.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because from what I gather, I'm looking at complaints through the union that they're not being treated right either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1987.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1990.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's disheartening that I know that, you know, constantly very somberly put where we are right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1996.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is disheartening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2000.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is disheartening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2001.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now I'm glad we can celebrate a road race and I'm glad we can celebrate trick or treating around the square and that's all fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2008.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And our constituents deserve that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2011.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We deserve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2012.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Don't get me wrong, we deserve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2015.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But that's not what runs the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2016.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right now, I'm afraid what the next year's budget's gonna be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2019.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We see the financial climate of this country right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2023.169s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm petrified to see what we... We saw what we went through last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2027.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think we need to reassess starting tomorrow evening with the Parking Enforcement Office and see where this council's going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2034.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see, and I'll jump ahead and I apologize, Madam President, but I see resolutions that are coming in front of us tonight that changing of ordinance for great people that have done a lot of work for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2045.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But out of all due respect, I was one councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2048.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How can I vote on something tonight where we don't have any guidance from a city solicitor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2053.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have any legal support from anybody in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2057.076s">[Scarpelli]</a>: whether the intentions of anything that's brought to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2060.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is good or bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2060.827s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can't do anything about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2062.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is very frustrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2063.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I apologize, I digress, but it's been a very frustrating last few days, and I hope people show up tomorrow night and share their concerns, because I tell you what, the phone calls and the emails I've gotten, it's not even anything about just people being kind to each other, just showing respect to each other at a desk, and we can't even do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2085.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, and thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2086.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I support Councilor Caraviello's resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2089.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2406.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2408.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One thing I find problematic today<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2413.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't have it in front of me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2415.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do we have someone from the city administration here representing the city anymore?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2418.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do we have someone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2420.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is there someone on zoom that just just just to relay these messages to the mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2424.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it on that note?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2446.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we so okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2447.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So in essence, right now, we don't have any, any representation to discuss any concerns and issues from our community from from the mayor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2460.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can, just because this is our second meeting now after the summer break and we have issues and concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2468.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it could be something that could be answered quickly through someone from the mayor's office and not having someone, I know that the chief of staff isn't here, but there should be someone here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2477.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They have a lot of people in that office, if I'm not mistaken, that could represent that office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2482.191s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'd actually put that in the form of a motion that if we can, that we request that someone from the city administration staff represents the city hall in our meetings to answer<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2496.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: constituent services concerns or issues in a media basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2499.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2501.621s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, considering only meet twice a month now, that I think it's important that we have someone here that it's, you know, I don't think we're scary anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2509.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we've all toned it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2510.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think we're bullying anybody anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2512.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we're in a good place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2513.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can do that, Madam President, I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2515.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's also chocolate milk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2518.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: today is uh if you look at the it's uh it's a very important day forget about not only hispanic heritage month and it's also we have very it's we went over that this morning that's why i know that director said today's a very important day for chocolate milk believe it or not do you want to make that a beat paper please please that'd be great thank you i'm just sorry a point of information as well on that point um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3742.311s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it similar?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3743.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's expensive, but it's pretty well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=3744.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, they run their program, if you have a parking sticker, I believe it's increased now to $180 per car, but it's citywide and it's run pretty well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6203.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not going to succeed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6689.969s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6693.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Another avenue would be to contact our city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6699.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our city solicitor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=834.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=836.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, uh, Council nights, uh, you know, comments, uh, I think, uh, hit it right on target.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=844.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, uh, what we see is over and over again, the most important people in our community, the people that make our community run are the ones that are being neglected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=857.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=858.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you're talking to our brothers and sisters that are teachers or brother and sister firefighters or our secretarial staff or other departments that that are crying out and saying how do we, how do we survive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=876.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: hasn't met with administration, hasn't tried to figure out strategic processes and try to figure out a way that we can get to a reasonable percentage raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=890.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we're told we talk to people and try to get more invested, it's a personnel matter, which we know, but when it's phone call after phone call and person after person and family after family that are being affected,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=903.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's alarming and it's alarming to the point where we're seeing good people walk out the door, whether on their own or with assistance or whether it's teachers that are qualified and our kids love and making impacts and moving to different communities or whether it's firefighters or police officers leaving to go to different communities or our secretarial staff leaving because it's just not worth working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=930.487s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's better just to stay home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=932.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's just not fair for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=934.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's not fair for the people that need you in your seats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=937.92s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I was raised as a strong union member and understanding that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=946.842s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we're stronger in force and understanding that as long as we all work together, something positive has to come out of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=954.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So from one union member to others, we're standing with you and hoping someone listens and tries to put something forward in a positive way because I talked to a lot of teachers last night and I feel the frustration and I could feel, when you walk through this door, you can feel<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=977.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the dreariness, you can feel the negative aura.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=981.233s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's sad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=982.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sad because I love this community, I love this building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=985.855s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I apologize that you have to feel that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=987.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, as a council, as one council, and I think most of us, if not all, we stand with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=995.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we need to find a way to create something to make sure that all of our employees are happy and they're not leaving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1007.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I think that you've already, like you said, we've already, we've already proven all of the unions behind you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1013.407s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've already proven that no matter what, we're still going to come in, you're still going to work your tail off for this community, and you're still going to do what's best for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1021.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, and I know it's getting frustrating, and it's going to be a time when<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1026.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: people are just going to say enough is enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1028.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then when someone needs a permit there's nobody there, or when someone needs a return phone call there's going to be no one there, or the children to walk into a classroom, and they're going to nobody there, or there's going to be a fire somewhere, and we're not going to have enough firefighters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1042.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these are the fears that I feel, and it's it's frightening so again, I appreciate what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1050.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you did tonight for coming up, because I know it's not easy, but we're standing with you, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2389.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2390.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for coming out because I know it's not easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2392.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we appreciate that and believe us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2395.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know for one concert, and I'm sure my fellow Councilors, we've all received emails and phone calls with very similar frustrations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2403.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So just to be clear, you gave us a picture that it shows for automobiles that has a ticket, a permit that's updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2413.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or a permit that's updated with a handicap placket, and you were all still ticketed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2419.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you went to the, and what was the answer from that department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2427.236s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So did they, did they fix these?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2429.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so that's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2431.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2431.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because what we've heard is there are some that they haven't, they've asked to file, go through the appeal, they lose the appeal, and then the repercussions with that is to go to the state, which is a $250 fee anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2445.231s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2445.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's frustrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2452.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, I know I'm just asking questions we can't put anything for amendments or recommendations but maybe we'll do this next week because I think that, again, working in a community that has a very viable and transparent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2467.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and involve traffic and parking department in that community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2471.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've had multiple meetings when it comes to any types of fee or fines or different changes to the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2478.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when it happens in different neighborhoods, those neighborhoods are in meetings with their department head to discuss that as community meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2486.73s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'll make a recommendation next week when we can as a resolution that we recommend that our new parking department<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2495.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Traffic and parking department, and their director, take major steps with our communications department to start meeting with neighborhoods, even if we go from southwest hillside, the Fulton Heights North met and break it up that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2510.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that they can come out and have community meetings that to discuss some of these rules because there's a lot of confusion going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2517.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that I know they said they've done something online to enlighten people, but it's just not enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2522.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, and like you said as we move on to July, January 1, when this really hits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2528.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think before then we have a few months that we can still reach out to our constituents and really educate people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2534.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that might help with that piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2538.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think transparency is very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2539.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that that'll be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2541.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I just want to make those comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2543.78s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate you for coming up tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2546.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3165.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: looking to change that policy now because of the lack of federal funding, because we have so many private ways in this community that we're looking to eliminate the private way, and that would eliminate any of those concerns, Mr. Sacco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3181.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It does, but this is the reason the community should know as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3187.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why we should, you know, there's so many different factors to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3193.695s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this situation to help our community, whether it's more funding from the government to repave streets or having issues like this where, you know, DPW's hands are tied because these, this rules that need to be changed that say that we can't trim a tree that has public safety concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3211.64s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, because we do have, we do have students still walking down that street to go to school when it's walk Metro day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3217.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if it's under a tree that's that safe, I hope that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3220.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. McGiven can help us with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5900.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we're doing farmers markets, public library, no disrespect, but that's really,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5905.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's one demographic, if you really look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5909.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have we looked at doing the PTOs at the high school, where we have hundreds of parents going through?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5914.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we doing like the Mephiti football games?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5917.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have hundreds of parents going through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5919.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we looking at different events?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5920.868s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, I understand whenever we do these surveys, I don't know if it's as visible to everybody else, but we keep doing it at the same places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5930.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We keep doing these at the libraries, the farmers market.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5934.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are other people in the community that are represented, but we're not going to them at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5938.459s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that we should really take a hard look because this impacts our community, the whole community, not just this demographic, because it seems like that's all we're doing right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5950.01s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's with tagging one part of the community we have to start looking at our when other communities do these outreach and I think it's very important this is this is a great step because we're seeing this is where I would like to see more public participation, more involvement but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5967.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why aren't we doing this more into the largest scheme scheme of it that the public schools when they're doing different meetings that, that, that, you know, the, the big athletic events in the city, you know, the, the, the big road race this weekend we're having hundreds of people this weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5986.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why wouldn't we be doing things like that I mean the mystic rest of the river festival September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5992.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, that's the same people that go to library and say people that will see at the farmers market.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5998.34s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have broadened, you know, our outreach here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6002.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's look at Sunday we're gonna have hundreds of people running a city wide road race.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6006.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well let's look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6007.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to see that if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6009.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6045.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not a lot of residents in the city of Mexico, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6048.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 500 is not a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6050.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't disagree, but I guarantee it's the 550 people that do all the surveys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6055.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to start reaching out to a greater scheme, a greater number, because this is a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6062.681s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you can see it, this is a big, people don't realize how huge<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6067.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this negotiation is exactly what it entails.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6070.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6072.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7026.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7027.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, before the table, I wish I had the opportunity to speak before but again, these are situations that has nothing personal to do with the position, but the clarification of what we haven't had yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7040.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then again, to my, to my fellow Councilors that remember the days that we were told one thing and then not not given the proper answers what we needed and here we are again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7052.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just spoke to 500 people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7055.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and told them that we support them, no matter what, that this administration is not following through with our union employees and what do we just do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7064.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just voted four to three not to table it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7068.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm waiting to see what the next vote's going to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7070.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7075.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my, what I just said to end that was, I can't wait to see the next motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7082.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all I want to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7251.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I- It's amusing because it's frustrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7254.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So don't make this a joke because it's not amusing because I'm happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7261.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7263.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, there were 550 people that weren't happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7829.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7833.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: John, thank you very much for your hard work in answering some of these questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7836.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is an easy question for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7840.47s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Fundamentally, if this doesn't happen, how difficult would this make our system?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7893.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7894.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to me, I think this is a slam dunk in the fact that you're talking about 0% loan, you're talking about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7902.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: possibly eliminating concerns to our residents, whether their meters are read wrong or read incorrectly, then have to adjust later, that could be crippling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7912.202s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that this is something that for myself, I think that it's not even thinking ahead, it's catching up and making sure that we are on the same page and working together as we move forward in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7927.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would look to support this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8121.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just to approve in general.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8127.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we'll just go with the others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8131.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, no, you take it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8133.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I think that I should jump in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8136.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll give you a sack.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=9369.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate Councilor Collins, Councilor Tseng bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=9373.692s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, you know, until it happens, until you know someone, it really doesn't hit you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=9378.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And just recently we had a young man that grew up on Almond Street, a prestigious athlete,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=9386.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: going off to play football in college, everything going right in his life, and felt something on his face at an all-star football game, and told his brother, that's a teacher at Medford High School, and said, let's feel some pain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=9401.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we quickly, the family had quick resources that they took him over to the doctors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=9407.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right away, they sent him to Dana-Farber.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=9409.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, he found that it was lymphoma.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=9414.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with the grace of God and the process that his family went through and having Dana Faber in the backyard, they got to it right away and the diagnosis and the surgery went well and everything looks positive in this young man's life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=9427.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So until you see it, but you have to realize it, it's happening to the person right next door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=9435.911s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to see the movement that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=9438.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we can make here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=9441.268s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's exciting and it's a way that we can have just a little piece that we can support and move this horrible disease out of here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=9453.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1113.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1114.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First, I apologize for my parents and my tightness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1116.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I came from emergency work and either late for another 45 minutes to get here as fast as I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1122.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I apologize for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1123.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So on the note of our parking garage, I know I missed the beginning of it, but being creative, I think, is what's so important that we reach out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1135.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you would think that looking at the different entities, bigger developments that are going on in the city, partnering with them, but even thinking outside the box, I brought this up years ago, that one thing Medford lacks is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1152.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: facilities for youth for outside activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1159.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And neighboring communities have used parking garages, the top floors, as indoor facilities and recreation facilities, where you would not only get the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1173.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the partnership to help build such a structure, but at the same time, also have the opportunity to create funding through<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1185.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: fees through parking from the participants from those programs during the evenings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1192.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you look at Boston, right next to the Boston Garden, you have a good example that there's an indoor athletic facility, excuse me, basketball city that's right above.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1203.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they have five<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1205.907s">[Scarpelli]</a>: five stories of parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1207.768s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Top layer is a recreational facility that's utilized by its city, its recreation department throughout the day, and still leaves enough parking for businesses, merchants, for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1225.553s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for multiple uses, but at the same time, creating revenue with a partner and trickling down those funds to make that happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1232.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's different ways to be creative here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1235.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's something that's drastically needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1238.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we've talked to many people and these are, what is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1244.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 22 years of master planning for city<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1247.311s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would love to find a way that you now encompass both sides of our square as we start looking toward development, putting in, bringing in parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1261.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1262.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that it's one of the reasons why we can't further development in Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1267.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think it's, you know, where do you put the cart in front of the horse?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1273.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have to make a move.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1274.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that this is probably a very important step to move Medford Square forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1278.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I thank you, my fellow Mustangs, that they keep fighting the fight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1287.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1477.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1478.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, documentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1480.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything is in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1482.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, this is something that we've all been waiting for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1485.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that Mr. Heineck is a cornerstone of our community, and, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1491.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something we've been preaching about for years, bringing in small businesses that keep business out of Winchester and out of Somerville and right here in our own backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1502.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And why not support one of our own?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1505.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, as I said, everything's in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1508.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: After my colleagues' comments, I move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1511.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4000.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe we're all supported Councilor Caraviello with that motion, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5126.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just reiterate what my fellow councils have been saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5130.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It seems like lately, the city of Medford has been getting a tail kick by the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5136.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You see some of these concerns we've had with DCR, the public transportation, what's happening with removal of buses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5144.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then something we'll have to discuss because something very dangerous is going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5149.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll be making a recommendation soon to close off the on-ramp for 93 at the rotary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5157.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They put barriers that now jet into the highway and leaving people in the most dangerous, dangerous situations without any notice to anyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5169.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if you're taking that exit and you're a Method resident for the last 30 years, and you hop up on the highway and all of a sudden you look up, there is a fixed Jersey barrier right in front of you, pushing you right into traffic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5184.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're having a serious problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5186.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that what we need to do, to be honest with you, is have a meeting with all of our state delegates and sit with them and ask them for some guidance on where we're going with what we're seeing here in Method.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5200.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because to me, it's nothing but a lack of respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5204.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think we need some movement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5206.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my recommendation is that not only with what Councilor Caraviello said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5213.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our neighbors on the Felsway are just appalled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5216.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, just appalled, but if you, like Councilor says, you move up and down two miles to a different community, and their streets are paved with granite and cement, it's beautiful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5230.717s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think there's a major discrepancy going on here, and I don't know why, but it seems like when you start adding it up,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5240.048s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Method's getting the short end of the stick in many different state entities, whether it be DCR, DOT, or public transit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5246.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my recommendation, if Councilor Caraviello allows me, that part of this discussion, that we invite our state delegates to come down and really ask them what's going on at the Statehouse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5258.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What did we do wrong?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5259.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did someone break up with someone's significant other or something that comes from Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5264.51s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know, but we need to figure this out because this is terrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5269.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's frustrating that we're hearing more issues coming from the straight state side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5273.796s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have enough to worry about here in Medford right now to be piled on with what's going on on our state roads and highways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5281.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and public transit, and now our sidewalks the DCR, and our path issues or lack of grass issues or cleanliness issues or more on issues, we go on and on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5294.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think we need to sit down with people and look them in the eye so I'll make that as a form of emotion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5300.247s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5491.088s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just a point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5492.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that Representative Donato just informed me that he is working extremely hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5500.453s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's talked with the state this morning for any questions about the on-ramp.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5506.076s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're coming out with new signs and information for the community as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5511.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we thank for his commitment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5514.827s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's that's a benefit of having someone like Mr. Donato in place that he's sitting home watching these meetings, and he's already ahead of the game so I really appreciate that so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=12157.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry, I have to mention, I know that unfortunately I couldn't make it the other evening, but my daughter did go and the kudos to the Method Police Department on the National Night Out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=12172.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What an event to really showcase what our Method Police Department does for our community and the discussions I've had with neighbors and friends that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=12186.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: really never looked at the police in that light.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=12188.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was such a refreshing conversation we had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=12192.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just want to give them congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=12195.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is what really, these are the type of events that really enhance what NEPA's really about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=12200.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's exciting to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=12204.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we should do more of those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=12206.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=738.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so you just, this is your new location, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=741.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=741.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what was there before that, before?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=745.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was a Grava?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=749.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, because is that what Grava used to do, their auto body, but they don't do it anymore, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=755.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, so you're just taking that location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=760.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I understand Councilor Caraviello's concerns, but I'm not going to penalize a new, a new business owner that wants to come into the city for the bills of, of other<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=775.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: business owners in that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=776.579s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that if you look at the permit and everything that's been requested of them, traffic issues and concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=785.107s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Chief Buckley signed off on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=787.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know in the past, I can ask my, my Councilor genius Council night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=794.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we could we put a review on that Council night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=836.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think if I could recommend that with Councilor Knight, if we could recommend that and just move forward with the six day review and ask for the code enforcement and Chief Buckley to visit that before we vote on any movement moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=851.115s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think I want to continue with the process, but again, I don't want to penalize a future business owner for something he hasn't done wrong yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=860.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or intends to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=861.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So right now, all the paperwork seems to be in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=864.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand the frustration of the merchants in that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=867.949s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same time, I think that has something to do with oversight and not with, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=876.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the petitioner that's in front of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=877.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would move approval and ask for some feedback from the court enforcement officer and the chief regarding our concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=1031.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wouldn't mind because it gives us a little more time once it's in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=1034.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would support that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=1107.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=1109.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, if those people aren't familiar with the national night, I would is, um, we have been supporter in my capacity, my professional capacity in the city of Somerville, and it's a great opportunity to bring our neighbors together and as a unified front and and the best people, the best profession to lead that are our men and women in the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=1135.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if I know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=1137.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, we have Lieutenant Harden it here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=1140.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If he's, um, you know, just fill us in with all the particulars and I think we should all spread the word and I'll be part of such a great event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=1148.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=1842.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=1854.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for your time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=1856.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Madam President, this is important, but we need to get the word out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=1861.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe one of those mystery surprises should be a robocall from someone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=1867.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you, what's amazing is this is what our officers do on a day out anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=1875.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's amazing that, again, you brought this out and everybody's volunteering to get involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=1883.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And because I know the four people standing in front of me and the officers you mentioned all have a love and a tie to Medford and all want to continue with its greatness that it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=1893.779s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate men and women in blue, I really, I think this is, you know, you guys do everybody does such a good job and making so many people feel welcome but when you bring all those groups together for an event like that, it just reaffirms how great your department is, and how great our community is, and I can't thank you enough for doing that so I'll be there, I will not be in the dunk tank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=2060.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can amend the motion, just make sure that we send out a roll call so everyone in the community knows about this amazing event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=2067.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=2068.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=2381.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=2382.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a no brainer in my eyes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=2385.187s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think you're talking about the recommendation to appoint Erin DiBenedetto to the election commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=2392.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: See, this is a person that who I know personally and I can vouch for her that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=2401.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: her commitment to this community and through volunteerism while her children were in the method public schools, and then her energy and efforts to then pick up the mantle around the school committee and hold that office gives her an opportunity to really give that office a different viewpoint and a sense of history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=2423.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think it's, I think,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=2427.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's someone I respect someone that I think is very honorable and would be a perfect fit for this position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=2432.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, all I can say is I appreciate you even putting your name down there and, and continuing your, your, um, uh, pursuit and giving back to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=2443.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, uh, and, and another facet informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=2445.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, and again, you have to thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=2448.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the husband, Joe, who's always been there and he just keeps smiling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=2452.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=2452.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just keeps dragging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=2454.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You keep dragging him out and he keeps smiling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=2456.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I, um, I would, I would support this nomination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=2461.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3825.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpellilli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3827.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3829.258s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, my colleagues, for bringing this forward because it is something that we can discuss and discuss we should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3836.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I'm looking at this in three different processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3840.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One, the presentation and the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3842.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that the budget season was difficult, but I've heard from so many constituents that something serious as this, probably something<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3855.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is probably a topic that's probably.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3859.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: one of the most intense, serious questions that we should visit in our community in years, that we haven't visited in years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3867.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think understanding the process and looking how it was presented that we're presenting this in the middle of the summer and a lot of people that aren't around to really share the concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3879.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I personally received over a hundred emails, phone calls, people expressing concerns, questions that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3889.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, to reiterate the process, not having the city assessor here tonight to answer some questions I think it's very important to not have the questions that we have to get answered for us is very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3903.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For one, the senior exemption, I think it sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3907.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we should give every senior exemption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3909.766s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, it falls back on the taxpayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3915.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It'll be an additional money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3918.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we're talking about $12 million, if we have a tax break and understand the ramifications of who's gonna pick up that break.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3930.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it's gonna be taxpayers, the general taxpayer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3934.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that number that Councilor Villes mentioned of 500 some odd dollars a year, that's a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3943.459s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The other question people asking is, okay, so this is for one year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3948.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then what do we do after that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3949.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do we apply for others?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3951.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these are just simple questions that can't be answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3954.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The other piece of this is truly the infrastructure within City Hall right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3959.191s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think we have the manpower or the person power to really function or present an override in its totality<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3971.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that could be put forth in a thoughtful and professional way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3980.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just don't think we have that capacity today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3983.661s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's another concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3989.065s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then when it comes down to the concerns of the constituents and I'll share with everybody, the biggest issue is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3995.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is going to affect so many different people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3998.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had a, we had a budget season that was very contentious, and a lot of people called us extortionists and, but it was something that we needed to move forward to make sure that we, the city gets gets the basic necessities that we think we need to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4015.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then I had a discussion with the mayor and talking about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4019.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Some of the concerns we've had for years, I was a councilor that put forth a debt exclusion for a new fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4028.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor assured me that it's going out to architectural design this week and we're moving forward with the new fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4036.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's in a positive light.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4041.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we've gone through, what Councilor Behr so eloquently put, and the pains that we've seen the last couple of years,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4049.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: think had a direct reflection on the COVID outbreak and the lack of growth here in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4059.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about the 40B projects that we haven't been able to get off the ground and creating revenue that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4065.827s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The Mystic Ave corridor and increasing revenue by opening up new zoning for clean energy or biotech or whatever<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4079.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4081.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know Councilor Caraviello talked about everyone else being landlocked and Metro being a unique community right now, that we can really do some great things and create revenue that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4092.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So our first license went out to our marijuana distributor that will bring in some funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4098.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're finally seeing some light at the end of the tunnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4102.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And believe me, I'm not calling this a knee jerk reaction, because it isn't, because we've lived through some tough times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4109.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but I think ultimately who this affects in the community, the people we're trying to support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4116.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, all of us have talked about, you know, affordable housing, people not being able to live in Medford, people not even be able to afford rents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4123.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, the homes that aren't single family or the homes that are rented,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4130.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what happens because the taxpayer is not going to fit the bill for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4134.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All they're going to do is turn and increase rents for their renters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4139.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's not going to help one of the biggest groups we've all worked for to make sure that we can make sure that methods affordable for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4148.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think there's a lot of questions that if<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4151.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had a team here, and we can sit together and figure out what's the best course of action with the true blueprint of what true new growth looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4162.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And understanding where we can, where we need to move.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4165.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Listen, if $3 million is what it is and we need to move forward with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4170.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: after it's a thorough plan and how we don't hurt our taxpayers as much as we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4174.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's something we visit, but it's something we visit and explore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4178.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's very dangerous tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4180.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The other point that I'll bring up is that, and I, you know, I talked to my colleague about this, that, you know, George, you know, people, this is another mis-attack.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4188.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's another mis-attack.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4189.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In the middle of the summer, you're coming in, you're blindsiding the public and then, bam.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4194.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't want to divide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4195.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4199.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done a good job working together, and I just don't want to divide the city any more than it has to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4210.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are important issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4213.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's something that we've all looked at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4215.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think it's it's also important that we truly don't know what's down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4220.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've we've asked the mayor and I think the mayor is going to present us with the capital improvement plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4226.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one of those plans is going to be a new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4230.076s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if that's the case, you know, if you're talking about looking at the parents and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4236.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what they'll be asking for for something like that and what we're asking for today, it's not just $550.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4246.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that's gonna be impacted many different levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4249.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So a household's not just gonna see an increase of $550, it's gonna be much greater.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4253.268s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what I fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4254.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that not having, you know, people in this room that can answer our questions and us not vetting that out properly as a team, I think, you know, even with any money people, we do how many readings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4269.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We do three readings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4270.779s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think it'd behoove us, I know I wanna hear everybody before I make any motions, but it would be really beneficial for all of us to really sit down and look at the plan of totality before we put this out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4283.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's knee jerk reaction because the truth of the matter is, I've gotten the emails too that said, hey, we need that override, support the override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4291.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, okay, in theory, it sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4295.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With $12 million, we get to do all these great things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4301.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4303.274s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and that's and that's the other underlying situation that is is bothersome to me so I just caution I know that everybody wants other people want to talk but I just, you know, I appreciate bringing this forward because the dialogue has to come out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4318.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We are, we are in some constraints.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4320.459s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think this is another situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4322.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We worked together with the administration say, let's look at true new growth instead of looking for a proposition to an app override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4330.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that looking at that and exhausting that before we do something this drastic, because this hurts the person that lives in our neighborhoods and in every single home and apartment in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4343.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we just have to be careful because as good as it sounds out front,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4349.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You did your homework, no one's ever going to question that it's very thorough, but there are other questions that what is this with the two and a half, is this added with the two and a half, or without the two and a half the original two and a half.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4361.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it with the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4363.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How much would it be if we had to incur the cost of the senior exemption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4370.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand where that went because we did our assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4374.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We got a report back when I tried to do the debt exclusion for the fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4377.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe it was with every single senior citizen to be excluded, it was $17 a quarter, I believe, for our taxpayers to build a new fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4390.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4392.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's not easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4394.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That failed, I believe, six to one back in the day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4399.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, and again, even at that point I presented it, knowing that we haven't vetted it out properly so, and this is, this is a big deal here in the city so like I said, I really think we should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4412.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: take a deep breath, look at all the information that was presented, and really move on to another meeting so we can understand this with all our stakeholders in the room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4420.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That means the mayor's office, a city assessor, and looking at all of the different angles and all the different possibilities that we can benefit from and we can also hurt from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4433.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6098.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think Councilor Knight makes a lot of sense, and I think Councilor Bears brings up a lot of concerns that we all feel, but I think that there is a better solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6110.427s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6113.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd make the motion that we table this and we move forward with the administration that we put a team together with this council to focus on new growth and put a plan in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6129.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I think where we are right now, we're at 12 o'clock where we were during budget season, during budget night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6139.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we're at a point right now that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6142.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: either side, if this goes one way or the other, it's gonna impact a lot of this community in a negative way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6149.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: where instead, I think it's a push that we need to get everybody at the table with our leadership here and move forward quickly and looking at and moving forward with new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6161.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that that's, it's out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6164.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about, we talked about the fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6166.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about the permitting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6167.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about the new growth in taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6170.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about all these avenues that we have possibilities to build that number and,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6177.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe at the end of it, we see that there is still a deficit of some odd million dollars that we need to look and focus and bring it to the voters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6185.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But right now, like Councilor Knight said, and like I said previously, I think it's the process right now that this council has done great things together and we've listened to each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6195.621s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think we respected a lot of what we needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6198.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think this council today needs to look at this, but really not to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6204.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that quick and moving forward with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6207.142s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, you know, I hear council saying, you know, put it to the voters, but I think first the voters put us here to do our job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6217.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't think we've done enough right now to get the most from the administration and ways we can work as a unit to create the revenue we need that we don't have to go for Proposition 2.5 override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6229.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm hoping my,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6232.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My fellow councils can see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6234.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would love to see a date certain for a meeting with the administration, the city assessor, and looking at a list of new growth that we together, that we already know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6250.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, we've already talked about the 40B project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6253.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have already talked about Mr. Gabb.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6255.486s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've already talked about Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6257.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's time we need to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6260.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, it's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6264.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think we're ready to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6265.268s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the mayor and administration, hopefully they're ready to come to the table and let's get this done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6269.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that moving forward with the proposition two and a half override in this process, I think is a little, is a slippery slope in many different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6280.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, like I said, I appreciate the banter, I appreciate the information, but I think it's something that we need to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6292.148s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is our job to find a way to bring everybody together so we can find a solution other than the most drastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6297.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know some of us feel like we're ready for the most drastic, but I think it should be revisited in a different light.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6307.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11858.436s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11859.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So gentlemen, thank you for being here so late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11862.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11864.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I, you know, I can honestly say 10 years ago, one of my first initiatives was making sure Method brought charging stations to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11873.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And people said, you're crazy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11876.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is, this is nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11878.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can now retire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11879.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if you guys are looking for another consultant, just call me, you know, but we're doing is what you're doing is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11887.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, you know, the biggest concerns we had when neighbors heard, you know, we had that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11893.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've had some serious issues in that that Plaza that, you know, one was a dumpster that was taking in free clothing that turned out to be a disgrace but what what we saw what I saw, and, you know, doing my research.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11909.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's so far away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11911.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's exactly what we're asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11912.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I like the concept.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11914.171s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that probably the only thing that I'd ask, and I'm sure you have the answer, that any of the materials that are gonna be advertised are tasteful and are in good nature with our family atmosphere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11929.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's the biggest question I had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11931.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Other than that, I love the idea that you're giving back to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11936.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: anywhere we can spread the word, something simple as an election coming up here in September and adding something like that is very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11943.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So anywhere we can add that, where it's not an eyesore, where people love to put those signs in the middle of violence, I think this is a tasteful and respectful way to kill two birds with one stone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11957.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think it's a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11959.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would support this and we'll approve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12062.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12063.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Shut off the microphone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=655.177s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Councilor Caraviello brings up a good point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=657.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it's 137 for one, and we've always been under the impression that anything over $2,500 comes to this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=666.764s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And were there any others other than in the past year, other than that 137?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=673.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1528.368s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1529.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1530.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know if it was the KP law attorney or yourself mentioned that, Mr. South, is it true that part of the KP law budget that we're paying for legal representation, that's what pays for the private investigator?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1546.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that coming out of the same line?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1672.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Emotions are high because we have so many gaps and so many needs in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1677.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we're seeing as concerning is that one of the biggest line items is a law department that we've been asking for an understanding where this money is going and no one's told us a thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1691.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I revert back to the first budget meeting we had where I was very concerned<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1699.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was very intense and understanding these are the questions that are so frustrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1705.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I teach us on afforded reasonable raise pox and shambles our streets and sidewalks are a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1714.526s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we present a money paper that counts a caveat was correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1718.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This council voted $5,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1722.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: legal fees for representations a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1724.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we looked at that as $60,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1727.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we then came in at the beginning of the season, the new term, and we talked with our new Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1733.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And unfortunately, we were screaming for a representative that could represent the council legal representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1740.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that hasn't happened, which has left us in pretty vulnerable situations that actually afforded us<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1749.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: few negative situations that came out legally, because we didn't have the representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1754.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we've asked over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1758.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe the council was promised legal representation of this council if that paper was voted on, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1766.453s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as we look at the budget, we don't have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1768.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So correct that that hasn't been added.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1840.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll say this again, like I said the other evening, normal and other communities, Councilors and the CEO of their communities work together to find solutions to make our city succeed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1856.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's not, this is the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1859.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a blaring problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1860.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's just not the mayor who's running the CEO of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1864.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1865.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If there was give and taken, we understood, but there isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1870.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This body has been disrespected time after time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1874.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're coming to us with information that we've been asking for for months, if not years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1879.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we have to, we have to, under pressure, vote it through so we can run the business of our administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1890.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it falls on deaf ears when it's a plea that the mayor needs this for all this work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1897.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So do we.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1900.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're hired to follow the ordinance and laws of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1904.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we need that assistance to make sure that we can help this community grow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1909.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, like I said, if we work together, like was promised, and if we shared our failures and shared our successes together,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1919.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we could have a lot of great things happen in this community, but instead we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1924.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1985.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll just leave it at that, but I and I'm gonna, I'll end with this, and I, we understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1991.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not naive not to understand that we're a public body and understanding that the confidentiality rules, but that still doesn't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=2002.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: allow the administration not to meet with us on understanding what the monies, how much money and where it's going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=2009.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It doesn't have to be the person's name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=2011.274s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It doesn't have to be the situation, but understanding the process, that's all we're asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=2016.436s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we could understand that because when we hear things and we sit here like nights like tonight, we're given things, it would be nice to understand that what Mr. South presented<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=2028.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're names all over this, and maybe that's right or wrong, but if we sat with our administration in executive session and explained to us where our money was going and what situation without the person's name, that doesn't affect any kind of privacy issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=2049.272s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's all I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=2051.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3319.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I do have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3320.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3322.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that she, we, this is, I know that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3328.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had some difficult times in the budget and presentations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3332.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we just received the official budget just the other day, but I was under the impression that there wasn't anything in the budget for the cruisers and then the groundwater remediation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3346.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't, is that something that just happened recently?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3352.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Chief, is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3356.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because we're also talking about hybrid vehicles and would we be capable of having the hybrid vehicle with the docking stations and everything like that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3368.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3370.316s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3372.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's on now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3373.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I just, you're good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3375.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: During the regular budget meeting, was this known?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3378.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I thought we asked, when we asked the fleet if we're adding more police cruisers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3400.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3401.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3402.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3403.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3403.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a great question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3405.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then I know that the recreation,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3409.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Bailey could just give us a description of the 50,000 for because I, this is this is the only piece that with the recreation quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3423.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Recreation is a revolving account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3425.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The only way that it survives is a revolving account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3429.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you take $50,000, it's going to hurt us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3433.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if you just explain just real quick with that, just elaborate what that means with DCRA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3440.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand, but I think that as we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3443.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In my capacity, we pay DCR for our ranks too, so if you just elaborate so people can understand what happened here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3555.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so the rink is an enterprise account for revolving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3562.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry enterprise enterprise account Okay, so, so this was this what this this isn't wasn't your, you didn't know about this until you took it over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3570.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3571.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, if anybody can anybody tell us what the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3576.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How was, how did we lag and paying this for the last five years, prior to recreation taking it over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3605.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So moving forward, this payment will not come straight out of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3614.041s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, but that 50 $50,000 is you're going to be, you're going to be able to recover that 50,000 because I know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3627.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we're taking that, you're okay with your programming and... So on a new contract each year, we should be paying it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3637.868s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, but this came out of this year's account, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3642.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it came out of the recreation revolving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3644.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3645.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my question is, are you okay financially by taking $50,000 out of your account?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3672.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So without that- I gotta tell you, you're doing a lot with little, and I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3678.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, the pond and the pool is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3683.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see the partnerships all over the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3686.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What you're doing together with different entities in the community, I think exactly what makes the recreation department so successful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3694.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I commend you and your team of, I believe, three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3699.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: By the way, I have 12.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3701.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: just so everybody knows my department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3703.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3705.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's in another city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3706.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm in another city, correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3707.096s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=4120.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: eliminate security guys at the high school correct that's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=4124.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I think that said and I just want to clarify for the public that's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=4282.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, just the question, because of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=4286.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the word that was said there was no security.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=4288.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still have that statement is false.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=4290.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have the monitors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=4295.764s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still have a resource student resource officer too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=4299.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=4299.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now that I know that opposite.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=4303.553s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mosaic was the point person, I believe, maybe I'm wrong, with the monitors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=4308.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who does that fall onto now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=4310.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Was that fall to Chief Buckley's?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=4326.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I agree this when you're talking about security,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=4329.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in a public forum, it's very, very tricky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=4330.969s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think this is something that maybe the school committee, the city council and the administration should sit down in a committee of the whole with an executive session to really bring up some, making sure that we've, what's going on, especially lately, that we're making sure that everybody's comfortable and that's reiterated together as a team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=4353.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I thank you and that answers my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=4356.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=5241.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Molly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=5243.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much, because I know this isn't,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=5245.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't a job that's been in place for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=5249.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that you're thrown into a fire and saying, okay, now you're in charge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=5255.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's very difficult because I'm directly involved in how the money is distributed as a department head and getting involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=5266.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The question that I have, and I don't want to put you on the spot, when we're talking about opera recovery, and you're talking about the people that were mostly affected, that was the teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=5277.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Was that weighted to look at what the teachers have gone through and to support whatever money could be used to then work with their administration on what they deserve, which is a reasonable wage increase?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=5295.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that something that could have been done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=5337.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so again, I know this is a difficult job and there's so many moving pieces, what you can use it for, what you can't use it for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=5345.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know there are some communities that try to manipulate the system to try to get ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=5350.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But like I said, I've seen ARPA move other communities in the most important avenues like libraries and recreation and mental health<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=5367.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and education and teachers and seeing where that goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=5371.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that it's not apples to apples because our deficiencies are very different than neighbor communities, but you answered that's a glaring question that's a little bothersome to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=5384.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=5385.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate your honesty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=5395.532s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I should have made that clear that you're just the person putting the numbers down and handing it off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=5401.417s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's not the person that's making decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=5403.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=5404.739s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=5480.33s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, like I said, though, I think that it's an understanding, just different deficiencies that we had to maintain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=5490.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But was there ever an opportunity to look at that piece when it comes to funding the teachers and how, I mean, that must have been difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=5508.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so we know that we said that there were 30 people that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=5512.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: were given- I did not say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=5514.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was an incorrect statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=5515.191s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, no, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=5515.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not sure who said that, but it was inaccurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=5516.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=5517.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so I know we had teachers that were pink slipped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=5520.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know how many there were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=5522.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Were they all retained now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=5523.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are they all back?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=6383.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just wanna take this time to just disclose that I do have a family member who works in the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=6391.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It will not preclude me from voting on the total budget, but I just wanted to make that disclosure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8934.231s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8935.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So first, thank you very much, Madam FBNA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8938.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8939.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it isn't easy, but I'm gonna,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8942.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My fellow Councilors have identified different areas that have been bothersome or questionable that they brought forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8953.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not gonna do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8955.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The first meeting I talked about passionately, talked about the lack of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8962.11s">[Scarpelli]</a>: your office and this body to work together to share in the failures and the successes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8967.671s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was lucky enough to sit next to you for many years and learn a lot from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8971.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I watched your passion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8974.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And my passion was by your chief of staff was promoted that it was bullying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8981.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I found a fence to that because she's one of your leaders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8986.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when you look at the situation that we're in, I find it difficult that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8992.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That you're coming here tonight, and you're expressing a deep passionate expression of what is important what's happened and that would have been great six months ago, as each situation came about, as we will talk as we wanted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9006.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we were colleagues, we talked about that, having that line of communication, working together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9013.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: where we can sit and talk about this and understand that, hey, we need these legal fees because of X, Y, and Z. And I know what personal matters, but it's also understanding in executive session, what the city, why we're moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9030.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had non-negotiables.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9031.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had non-negotiables and I apologize, I didn't get back to you today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9035.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I got into a little fender bender, thank God everything's okay, but I couldn't get back to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9041.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Tonight, you couldn't give me the answers for what I want, my non-negotiables.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9046.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My number one non-negotiable is having legal representation here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9050.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we talked about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9051.91s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We expressed that need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9053.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was $50,000 that we looked into that because I give you the example, the BJ situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9060.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We answered a question illegally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9063.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So held this city, this council,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9066.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and a negative light to the courts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9068.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's no way we're gonna win because we presented it wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9072.171s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Where if we had council, those are little things, that's just little things that could lead us where we need to be led.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9079.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were times we wanna go to executive session because this council looked unprepared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9086.115s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we didn't have that guidance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9089.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we didn't have that partnership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9092.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My other non-negotiables are educators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9095.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can I speak to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9179.539s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so, so with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9182.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have questions because we're not meeting with you, or we're not getting the answers we need that we've requested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9188.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, normally we would call a city solicitor city so sister city solicitor that would return our calls and answer our calls, or that there weren't overwhelmed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9199.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think Councilman he's not, he's telling the truth when it says when we.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9205.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when the council from KP Law stated that they don't work for us, they work for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9212.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what hurts us is, okay, so we have a question that deals with our body and we're not getting the answers because KP Law, sure they were there for X, Y, and Z, but I will tell you, the most impactful attorney that's moved this city forward in many years,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9233.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: was zoning consultant, Mr. Bobowski.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9236.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as we move forward to the next step of that we asked for funding, a lot of funding $50,000 I don't think it's a lot of funding we talked about the big scope of of new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9248.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was bypassed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9250.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we're talking about legal representation for the council, they haven't seen that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9254.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like I said, the other piece of this is our teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9258.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know my background.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9260.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was a former teacher for 15 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9262.52s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was lucky enough to coach you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9264.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was involved in the schools as a school committee member for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9268.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know what it takes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9269.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a backbone of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9272.045s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when you talk about your staff here feeling underappreciated,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9278.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have you heard what they're saying behind you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9280.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The morale is very low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9283.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My daughter goes to school there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9284.822s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sure your kids go to school there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9286.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9287.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hear horror stories from neighbors about paraprofessionals being treated like trash, being beaten up by students, and it's difficult to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9299.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's difficult to look at my fellow colleagues in the eye when they're telling me, George, you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9304.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm just leaving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9305.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm retiring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9308.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I trust and I know that helping our community move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9313.839s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't, I know, I'm not gonna beat up the school administration, I'm not gonna beat up the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9320.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're doing a very, they're doing what they have, what they're given.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9325.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm just telling you, I just think, especially for what we went through in the last few years, and the people that are on the front line every single day aren't being,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9338.142s">[Scarpelli]</a>: aren't being given the respect they deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9340.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's why, and that's not a political ploy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9342.745s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm telling you, this is what I feel as a former teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9346.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I saw what my family members do as teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9349.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I saw what colleagues have done during the pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9352.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9353.372s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you thought that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9355.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: everybody thought we'd find a way to support them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9357.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we haven't done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9358.698s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'll be honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9359.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't feel I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9395.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like I said, and this isn't a slight, I know it's because it's a totally different job than where you were when you're sitting there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9403.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But you wouldn't accept what's going on here today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9407.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I know that the person I sat with couldn't wouldn't deal with the budget being given such a late time that staff members coming up and disrespecting this body, shutting us down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9420.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: belittling us, that's unacceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9423.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is how we feel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9424.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that comments have been made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9426.911s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know comments have been made that, you know, your department heads feel that we are very aggressive and they don't want to come to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9433.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know what, it feels both ways when we ask the simplest questions and the simplest requests and we get nothing back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9440.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and I don't know why that's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9442.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, there's a lot of, there's a lot of healing that has to get done, but in the case of the budget itself,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9450.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are things that I just haven't seen that are going to give me the ability to move this in a positive light in my eyes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9458.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just want to let you know that face-to-face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=9461.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14870.099s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14870.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate all the department heads running around scaring and getting nervous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14875.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you know exactly how I feel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14879.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's exactly how we feel sitting behind this rail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14882.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's sad that it has to be that, that brings to this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14888.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if we would listen to, and that's a sad part of this, because I know that it puts everybody in a bad spot, but that's exactly how we feel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14898.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we get attacked, and we don't have the answer, and no one's answering the question for us legally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=16102.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=16102.888s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think just when I just caution the council, I can understand we're looking at a line that doesn't reflect people that are in this building right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=16114.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know we're looking at a supplemental budget, but no one knows what direction the administration going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=16120.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would caution us moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=16125.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the real people that work in the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=16126.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We really, I just want to think a little bit deeper with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=16131.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I should have said something earlier, but the question was moved, but there is, I will support movement when it doesn't have to affect a person that's working in our building every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17067.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I'm going to reiterate the same thing I said earlier, and this isn't a gotcha game or anything like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17073.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want you to realize<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17076.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As nervous as everybody seems to come to this podium right now, this is how we've been feeling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17083.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you people understand that when we ask for revenue, we ask for reports, when we ask for something and we don't get it, do you realize that we go and we have to answer to people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17095.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is difficult, this is very difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17099.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And maybe two wrongs don't make a right, but I'm gonna tell you, I had non-negotiables.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17104.717s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I was voted by my constituents that said, this is what I put George in there for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17108.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm telling you, the way that I feel I've been treated on behalf of the people that put me into this position, I can't vote on the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17122.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I asked for simple $50,000 so we have representation here for us, because I don't wanna be put in a position that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17132.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I can respect our directors coming up and saying how difficult that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17137.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17140.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I feel exactly how you feel, because I'm in that seat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17143.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as an elected official, we really have one purpose that we have any power on when we don't feel that we've been respected or we're not getting what we need for our constituents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17157.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You can call it political theater, whatever you want, but the truth of the matter is, this is the only bargaining chip we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17165.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17169.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it pains me that we have to go through this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17172.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I cannot support this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17175.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This whole process has been a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17179.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's been a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17181.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you can blame every other angle, whatever you want,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17185.115s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But not to have a dialogue with us has to pay a dividend, it has to pay a price.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17189.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's why I feel comfortable in understanding that, well, I'm willing to roll the dice and vote no on this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17196.917s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I'm not happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19275.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and set up to make sure that the neighbors all are informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19279.148s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that one of the biggest things that we're seeing, especially with the Eversource project, is a lack of communication with the neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19286.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is there someone that's going to be the person that's going to be meeting with the neighbors and giving them the updates?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19293.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then if it affects any<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19296.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we always have issues with neighbors that see citizens that need access to the driveways and, you know, access to getting out for dogs appointments, whatnot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19305.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But, uh, I want to make sure that's there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19307.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19334.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just to notify them that there is going to be some restrictions and travel flow, I think that'll be very helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19341.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19342.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19393.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who's still awake by now watching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20691.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20691.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that this is a step in the right direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20696.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, you know, again, this is a process that I'd like for us to sit together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20705.692s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And like I said, and I'll say it over and over again, is share the successes and work on our failures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20711.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's the only way that we can be successful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20716.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I made a statement from the beginning that my non-negotiables, I'll take you for your word that that's gonna be adjusted and I think that's my biggest fear was making sure that we have the representation that puts us in a position where we could make the best decisions possible for our community and having that person in place I think is gonna pay dividends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20745.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know this is very, very odd because it was a difficult process, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20752.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We all stated that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20753.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not gonna keep beating that up, but at the same time, I appreciate you coming together and figuring out a way to make this happen in the last hour or so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20765.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=264.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=265.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate Mr. Rafferty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=267.351s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know I'll support the second Councilor Knight's motion to waive and move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=272.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope you'll be in front of the council asking for a special time permit for the World Cup in Dubai.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=279.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can open up at two in the morning,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=282.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and close at 10 in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=284.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=286.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=286.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you can, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=288.719s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We won't be watching Italy, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=580.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that is important that we're very delicate when it comes to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=584.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know some people want specifics and that's very dangerous to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=587.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know Mr. Murphy, which are saying so it's not, we have to understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=592.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can't get into details of our security protocol because all we're doing is announcing possibly to the people with bad intentions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=600.313s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have to be very careful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=601.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a fine line that we have to walk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=603.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just wanna share that with all the viewers and the people that are here, just be understanding with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=610.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know what we're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=612.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We are looking, we ask questions about security.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=614.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It is a priority both I think for the city council and the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=618.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just wanted to share my view with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=620.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=1625.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=1629.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the gentleman coming forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=1631.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate that some of the funding is going to nonprofits, and I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=1639.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that my reservation to all the food trucks right now, especially with the pandemic just passing, is the commitment to a brick and mortar and what would happen with you taking a certain percentage away from a brick and mortar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=1653.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's something that, before I make my vote, I'd like to hear more of the questions that are coming out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=1659.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm committed to our brick and mortar businesses that have committed to this community, especially during the most difficult times, and bringing an outside entity into a neighborhood that's going to directly compete with a brick and mortar, and their sustainability throughout this process and, and their bounce back, I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=1678.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's my hesitation with all the food truck industry and these pop up events because I think it, you know, if we look at neighboring neighboring coffee houses, and you take 20% of their business from seven to 11, it really is going to hurt their it's going to hurt their bottom line and their bottom line has a lot to do with the fees and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=1700.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: fees and permits requests and the limits that they have to live with while being a brick and mortar, as you well know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=1708.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, I'd like to, what y'all thought, as both a brick and mortar and a pop-up vendor, like, how would you, how would that impact your event if next door, a coffee establishment popped up a cart, maybe half a mile from your location?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=1755.372s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that's yet to be seen until, how do we find out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=1758.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We find out when Donuts of the Difference calls us and says, George, we have people just coming in buying donuts, but they're not buying their coffee because they're going to the coffee cart down the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=1769.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's my reservation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=1770.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate your honesty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=1772.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just wanted to be upfront and honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=1774.351s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are my reservations, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=1812.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have Mike's pastry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=1821.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In the Lighthouse Cafe, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2192.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I agree with council, Mr. Schrader, if you talk to neighboring, if this, if there isn't an issue with the push cap, if that, if the neighboring businesses,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2203.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: allow the 21 to 24 days, I wouldn't, I wouldn't, you know, I would recommend that maybe we table this until they petition those other businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2212.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if those other businesses approve, I would gladly vote for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2217.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, if it's, again, it's only for, I believe it's 21 to 24 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2222.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2223.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, I mean, if they did that and they come back and said, to see if we can bring another brick and mortar business,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2229.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I like the concept because it's a, because what the petition is asking for is a trial to bring in, uh, hopefully a full-time brick and mortar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2240.247s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Am I correct with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2241.507s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2242.168s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2242.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I, I agree with Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2244.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that maybe if we can table this, ask, um, ask our, uh, city administration to reach out to the neighboring, I believe there's four locations that, that directly affect, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2259.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: know, that timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2260.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't, I don't think they'll agree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2263.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think they'll disagree with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2264.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just think that we need that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2267.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've been pretty stuck, at least I've been, I've been pretty strict on my decisions and I don't want to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2273.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and throw anybody away, I say, I don't, I'm not interested, especially with some of the, you know, the downtown empty businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2280.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would love to see another business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2283.169s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can do that, I appreciate council and I bringing that open mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2502.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2503.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Letting them know it's only 21 to 24 days, probably less now, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2507.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, I really want to support this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2509.164s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that, but again, we have to be fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2511.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, this is where we don't have legal representation to help us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2514.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't want us to be in a point where we agree for something that it goes back to say, past practice, we've done this and then it hurts us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2521.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2523.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Procedural has nothing to do with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2525.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, we're a bit of a mess when it comes to legal representation when it comes to our council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2529.671s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's kind of a little trouble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2816.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2991.168s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She was here for public participation but it's paper to dash x x x, if we can, if she can come up and it's a public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3003.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can't take action, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3005.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She can speak, correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3015.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So just so you understand what it is, we can hear you because where it falls is unfinished business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3021.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can hear the situation, but we can't rule on anything, just so you know that, publicly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3029.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3254.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, Mr. President, if we can just have the petitioner, if she can reach out to the, um, Clark, maybe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3264.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: put on next week's agenda so we can lead her to make sure the engineers here also.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3269.071s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You don't have to be here in person if you're we saw the pitches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3272.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you want to come and call in from zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3278.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3324.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We also have, you know, we can have, that's an issue of handicapped accessibility, if we're saying that a resident is legally handicapped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3334.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Disabled, excuse me, and we have an issue in front of their residence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3338.739s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that we can, we'll make a resolution and we'll bring it forth next week with inviting all the parties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3345.223s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3356.761s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3471.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President, appreciate this reading this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3476.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This resolution, I know that Mr. Fitzpatrick, a longtime Method resident, well-known Medford family, loved Medford, and I'm very proud of his Korean War, being a veteran and supporting our country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3494.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And sad day in our neighborhood that Mr. Fitzpatrick has now passed on, and we send his family deepest condolences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3502.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=523.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=524.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, thank you for the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=527.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What's glaring right now is that what we have there, what's existing there, and prior to the past location, it was a huge public safety issue because as Mystic Ave backed up, people would fly through the Bank of America parking lot, just cut over onto the sidewalk right in front.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=550.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It looks like you're putting a landscape, and is that a fence right to the corner?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=593.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, we know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=593.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's why I would support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=596.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that the update looks beautiful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=599.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, like Councilor Caraviello says, this should be a gateway to our, probably one of our most intriguing neighborhoods for growth and development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=611.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it looks like it's very thorough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=616.191s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate your hard work on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1220.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry, thank you for being here this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1222.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My question is, are we, has there been issues about working on Saturdays here in Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1247.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Alright, so this job will be done mostly when then, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1270.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How long is estimated time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1272.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3702.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President Knight for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3706.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's been a very trying year, not only the congratulations for the students, but also our teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3711.868s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that if you heard them last night, you know how they've worked and how much time and effort they've put in and getting to this point with this class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3721.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the Method High School students, our Method vocational students,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3725.981s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and our Curtis tough students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3728.164s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Congratulations on the job well done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3730.907s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And definitely a class that's going to have some great memories, some trying time so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=106.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=108.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And thank you for Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=110.01s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nigro being here this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=111.571s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For my colleagues, I see everything in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=116.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I'll move approval after you give us a brief description.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=120.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we're excited about this business venture and can't wait to get it started, but if you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=243.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=250.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: all the hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=252.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a great venture that you put forth and we're so lucky to have have you here in Medford, and I think it'll be a great example and a shining star to, to really push off into other communities and show them what a great opportunity this can be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=269.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I, I see everything in order, Madam President, after my colleagues speak, I move approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=965.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=966.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a concern that I know we had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=969.747s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked, um, yeah, a few years back about some concerns about, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=975.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: not having a dog park in the South Method area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=979.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that there were some concerns and there were some questions asked if we could possibly use the small park area where the old South Method pool was and we could erect a fence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=995.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: where we could have it's a wide open space and we talked about possibly putting in a fence there and having dogs run off the leash in that area and there was some banter back and forth and we really didn't get get far with that and we really haven't heard much because of the pandemic and and to be honest the lack of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1018.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: activity down there for from different youth organizations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1022.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I know that this past season, they've been some concerns with dogs off their leash, while kids are playing, especially girls softball.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1033.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the phone call I a few phone calls I received.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1036.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I did call the mayor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1041.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that they<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1045.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They talked to the animal control officer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1047.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They supposedly sent someone out, but nothing has been resolved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1053.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The parents of the youth softball program had some concerns and I wanted to bring this forward so we can shed some light.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1060.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand I'm a dog lover, but I think that the safety of our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1066.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: residents, especially in a park, especially children, I think have to be first and foremost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1072.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know if there's, there could be a way that we can meet with, you know, I know there's, they're very organized organization for the dog walkers and group in South Medford at Tufts Park, maybe that we can work with meeting with them and the city administration to see if we can find a way that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1093.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: maybe putting in even if it's a temporary fence and the gate that that people really want to leave, take the dogs off the leash that there is an area there that's enclosed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1105.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that they're very respectful dog owners and they clean up after the dogs and that's not an issue there and but it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1114.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is a concern that even though the dogs are playful, it's left some negative marks in a few children's eyes and dogs are off leash that, you know, see a child that's playing with the ball and the dog runs up and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1130.351s">[Scarpelli]</a>: thinks that it's playtime and they take the glove away from the child, it leaves a negative mark and it's frightening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1137.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these are things that are concerning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1140.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know, you know, it might have been one or a few issues, but as this happened and the word cut out, I got a few phone calls from parents that the children play in the playground area and they<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1154.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They, they shared some concerns about the dogs around the other side of the fence and, you know, having the child run outside of the playground area onto the into the park they had some concerns so there are some valid issues there and I think that this is something we need to revisit as a council before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1171.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: something serious happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1172.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, if it's an isolated incident, that's fine, but still, now that we know this is happening, I don't want the next isolated issue being something where a child gets bit and we could have done something about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1188.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that, I know the police, we've tried to, I've asked for patrol, I've asked for the animal patrol officer to go out<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1197.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: patrol the area, but from what I've gathered from the parents, there hasn't been enough visibility from the city's departments that are protecting the children in that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1212.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we could just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1215.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: maybe make a motion to ask the report from the city administration and what they've done and that we can share with the community and then to see if the city can reach out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1228.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the city administration told me that there's actually a person that organizes a lot of the dog activity there that we can maybe work together and try to see if there's something we can do that can accommodate all the parties and make sure that we can put maybe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1244.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: even if it's a temporary safe, at least during the sports seasons, that they have that area on the side that we can fence in that would separate them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1356.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Madam President, I recall that strictly I know there were a couple issues that they, I think it's a big enough area that that dogs can run free and I think that another question that was brought up by that organization is that there wasn't enough separation from small dogs and big dogs so I don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1378.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To be honest with you, I think my first priority is the safety of the children in that playground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1383.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So let's see if we can move forward, see if we can find some sort of even just, even make it a pilot program for the rest of the summer, just to see how that works and then go from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1397.417s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But right now, I think that's something that has to be imminent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1400.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to be sitting here in a week and there was no action and a child was bit by a dog.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1406.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just, I feel terrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1407.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=175.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=176.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=176.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council bus brings forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=178.98s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a happy day for a great person but a sad day for this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=184.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Mulkey, I don't think I've ever met somebody so well-versed in their position in this building in a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=193.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He is prepared, educated, calm, cool, collective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=199.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And even under the most strenuous circumstances, I've never seen the man in a negative light ever in my life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=209.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was someone that you would call and hope that he would give you the answer that you wanted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=215.372s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when you hung up the phone, you were confident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=218.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And even though you didn't get the answer that you needed or you were looking for, you felt confident because you were educated enough to answer our constituents with a lesson and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=231.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: anything that we needed in our community, dealing with a code enforcement issue or a building issue or, I mean, the simplest things, the most intriguing items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=245.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's gonna be sad because we seldom work with many department heads, especially lately, that will call you back<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=259.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in a timely fashion, listen to your concerns and find a solution for you, whether it's what you're looking for or not within minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=271.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to say that he wasn't one of the busiest department heads in this community for a long time would be an understatement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=279.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I wanna thank him for his service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=282.814s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wanna thank him for his commitment to the city, his ability to probably lead, I think, one of the best departments in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=294.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think his whole staff is a true reflection of his personality and his educated background.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=301.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think he has made his staff multi-talented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=305.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think we have one,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=307.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: inspector downstairs one officer downstairs that that isn't well versed in many different building topics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=315.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think it's because of his leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=319.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when you talk to those people, not one ever have a bad thing to say a negative word to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=325.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=327.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're always working as a team, always supporting each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=330.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's comical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=331.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you look at that department, and if you can only clone that throughout the community and society, boy, we'd be a better place today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=339.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And a lot has to do with Paul Mulkey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=341.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, we're going to miss him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=345.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope that one of his staff will be the next to succeed him, because I think he has groomed them in his fashion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=354.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, again, thank you Council yes bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=357.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry Mr. celebration, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=361.311s">[Scarpelli]</a>: publicly I want to say thank you and if we can ask them to come up and make a motion to have them come to our next meeting and present him with a citation of service and something that we could publicly thank him I think would be important and I think that'd be well deserved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=377.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=2187.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: point of information I know we did have I know I had a few calls about the South Street intersection and the work that was being done by EvoSauce overnight because the I believe the chief had decided that due to safety concerns of that intersection they needed to do it overnight so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=2208.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't, they haven't stopped the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=2211.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think they're sort of working backwards now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=2214.005s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what it seems like to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=2216.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but again, it'd be nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=2217.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is, again, this is where, when we first sat down with Eversource, when they came to talk to us, one of the biggest things I kept saying, and I think all of us have said, having a representative paid for by Eversource or by the utility companies<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=2235.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to be the clerk of the works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=2236.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can't expect our city engineer to be the person that is sitting there making sure that they're held accountable because it's not feasible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=2246.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same time, this is something we're lacking in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=2250.297s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Other communities have the clerks of the works that make sure that all these jobs are being, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=2258.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, all the neighbors in the areas are being informed, making sure that, you know, the preparation isn't hindering traffic, that the cleanup is done satisfactory, so constituents aren't left with concerns and issues after they leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=2274.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, we're gonna keep coming across this until we have someone with boots on the ground there that's making sure that they're responding back to the city engineer or DPW director in some communities or the mayor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=2290.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is definitely an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=2292.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we've lost communication again with Eversource.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=2295.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They get to a certain point and then they forget that they have to report<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=2301.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: keep people informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=2302.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's, that's not good business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=2304.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, utilities shine again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=2308.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=3284.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=3285.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=3288.099s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Tseng for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=3289.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that as the former chair of the transportation subcommittee, it was daunting to get their assistance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=3296.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But one thing I realized that I would if we can add is maybe using some influence with someone in this room that maybe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=3305.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: could bring someone from the transportation department to our meeting and actually have a voice there that can answer some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=3314.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that maybe adding an invitation for someone from transportation to come in and help with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=3321.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=3322.582s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know who that person can be, but maybe if we can, um, ask, uh, uh, clerk her to be, so if he can reach out to maybe any of his, uh, former colleagues, if we know of any to really just to push, I know you've been, you work very closely with me, uh, uh, Mr. Her to be seen clerk her to be used to, to get some initiatives pushed forward in the last few years because of your, your, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=3351.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: knowledge of some people in the DOT and hopefully that might help to get someone to our meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=3357.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we, I would second the motion to make this into a committee of the whole meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=3364.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then I would also add to add someone from the MBTA to be there as a representative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=3379.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have vast experience, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=3381.698s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You may be adding your guidance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=3384.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that in the past, you've led me to bring in all the stakeholders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=3389.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, the stakeholders that are really in charge of making these decisions, I think I leave that to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=3397.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you can guide us a bit, I'd appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=3399.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=3400.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=3542.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thermoplastic, I got four words for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=3544.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thermoplastic sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=3546.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, thermoplastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=3547.928s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So whatever we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1029.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the is a date, daytime hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1034.191s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How long would that take?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1035.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, it would be just one day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1036.953s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1038.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And would it impact impact any neighbors driveways or anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1041.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't believe so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1042.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1042.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1043.539s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1712.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So first, thank you for coming out tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1714.316s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that first I want to thank Chief of Staff Nazarian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1718.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had some questions last week and I've been championing a sidewalk hot top crew for, I think, since the year I started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1727.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that until we do that, and it's good to hear that we're trying to find some equipment and have some onsite with our staff, but until we do that, even if we catch up, if we don't have, this isn't ongoing,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1742.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: year round as soon as the week that the cement is is mixed and we can stop pouring cement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1748.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is going to, it's just going to continue no you know as well as I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1751.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm glad to see that we're trying something I, I, you know, I did talk to the mayor and I know we have some budget concerns coming up and I know it's difficult hiring a whole new crew, but it's something that when<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1766.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: keep coming to us and the city keeps coming to us and asking for $250,000 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1772.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's frustrating, and I'm sure you can understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1774.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's frustrating because this isn't an issue that just happened this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1778.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't this is something that's been going on for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1781.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, I've always been taught to think ahead and try to find a way, not only to try to fix the solution, but make sure we stay ahead of that, that that's that problem as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1791.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, those are my concerns and my questions I think that with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1795.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The other concerns I had were the fact that unfortunately the procurement system is that has to go out to bed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1803.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what I fear, and working municipality I get a different advantage by talking to colleagues that I work with and understanding the lack of true contractors that are out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1817.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that aren't busy that aren't working that can do masonry work that that's a piece that I'm hoping we have licensed masons or people that work with cement I hear in some communities that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1831.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they're bidding out to landscapers, and they're making big bucks because they can bid for an easy, an easy buck because no one else is bidding for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1841.313s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, I just, we just want to make sure that we're, we're handling that the correct way and making sure that we're staying on top of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1849.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1850.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a crew that comes out there and uses the wrong mix or pours it the wrong way or whatnot and slopes it the wrong way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1858.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now it's turned into a rain issue in someone's neighborhood or someone's property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1864.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these are concerns that it's comical that people just listen to your concerns that you want to express as a council that constituents have asked for and said, shame on you for not wanting to fix sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1880.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you'd be a fool not to want to fix sidewalks, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1883.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think everybody here wants that done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1886.747s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think making sure that all of our questions are answered and we're putting the best foot forward, which I think the assessment's a great, great step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1896.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I've talked to the mayor and people, from what I gather, we're looking at the most needy<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1903.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: sidewalks where most dangerous sidewalks correct it's not going to be people aren't going to jump because somebody calls from one side of the city or not and everything wants to get done in front of this person's house of that we're going to we're going to track we're going to go after the number one sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=2029.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=2030.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is why this meeting is so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=2032.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate you coming out tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=2034.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that the last piece is, in the past, we've asked for lists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=2039.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've asked, just tell us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=2042.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The proof is in the pudding people want to see so when they when we would ask in the past can we have a list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=2048.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was daunting so I'm glad to see that we have this assessment that we can, we can actually now chart and follow the data as we're taking them off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=2056.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know I talked to the mayor and she said that that's not going to be a difficult task now we can now be informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=2063.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: of you know maybe monthly updates saying this is what we did and this is where we're going so it gives us a good understanding what what's getting done so we can actually see it and you know we you know the question a lot of times in the past um is we just bonded 250 000 and it doesn't seem like we've done anything well it was tough for us to say well look at this area this year because we didn't know so i think that it's important that we get that data as well<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=2163.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, to ask for the DPW commissioner for once this project had started, even for a monthly update, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=2171.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll end on a personal note.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=2173.764s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I kid you not, as I'm walking in here, fellow Councilors heard my wife call me crying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=2181.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Avid runner, marathon runner, going for a nightly run, raised sidewalk,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=2188.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: hit their foot, hit the top of the race sidewalk, and now my daughter's taking her to the doctor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=2195.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is stuff that, this is what you wish, as we're going through, it's that important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=2202.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm sure I'm just one case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=2204.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so it's imperative that we need to get these sidewalks fixed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=2209.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to focus on our infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=2211.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a vital piece of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=2213.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We all know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=2214.079s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and again, the questions I brought up in last week's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=2218.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: meeting where I think very valid and appreciate the answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=2223.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that between the chief of staff, the mayor, and two fine gentlemen in front of us, I think that I'm satisfied with what direction we're moving into, and I hope we see some real movement, and I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=2237.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=2298.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=2301.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Qualified bidders though, Tim, are we getting qualified construction companies?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=4324.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's understandable to the- Yes, I agree to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=4327.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=4327.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That'll be nice, that'll be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=4329.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=539.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I couldn't review it, so I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=574.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It sounds like it's going to be a great Italian restaurant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=602.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Me neither.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=637.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, if we, if like, again, we've done this in the past with petitions that we could ask any questions that we normally ask and then revert back to if the clerk could send us so we could table it for one week and then vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=652.351s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You don't have to be in next week, but we can vote on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=663.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's on the agenda, but it's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=666.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=673.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's 22-348, petition convict to license for Barry Rafferty, 51 Crocker Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=678.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Page five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=679.142s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, so it's been advertised, but yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=768.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, the, the, uh, the proper paperwork be reviewed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=774.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, the next week's meeting, I know that, um, again, I, I can't approve anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=780.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't have in front of me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=781.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't know nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=782.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's Mr. Raft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=783.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want to move forward myself, but, um, common practices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=788.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We reviewed the paper, the documents, make sure that all the departments have signed off on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=793.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if, you know, if we can look back on, there was a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=797.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a tequila restaurant that was supposed to open that didn't have paperwork that was signed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=803.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hence, now we have a delay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=804.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just want to make sure that we have that paperwork documented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=808.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would move forward with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=812.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if you could send us the copy of the documents with all department heads clearing this, I would move forward with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=1373.509s">[Scarpelli]</a>: needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=1374.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've looked at all the documentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=1377.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything is in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=1379.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, just the only thing is that the extended hours of operation is through special permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=1384.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So other than that, I find everything in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=1389.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And after my colleagues' questions, I would move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=1510.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=1513.424s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that as we looked at other, the only question that I had that was brought to my attention was the voting record for municipal elections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=1525.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that something that's weighed as we, as the mayor processes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=1529.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Cause I know that that wasn't a concern with other applicants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=1538.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's, I know that they shared her voting history and obviously she's a strong supporter of the four year elections, but in the two year elections, and this is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=1553.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a very important piece of our process here at Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=1556.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can get some.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=1586.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I only say that because it was shared, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2120.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2122.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2124.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I want to reiterate, I appreciate that somebody new to our community wants to get involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2130.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2132.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are multiple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2134.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: positions that are open right now that would probably be a better fit considering she does have a stellar resume.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2140.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think she's a very talented individual and someone that could really provide a benefit to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2145.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But like I said earlier, we were given the, to be honest with you, I wouldn't, I saw her voting record and Councilor Knight hit the nail on the head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2157.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're actually voting for a commissioner and it's nice that people want to do it, but it's a commissioner that's never voted<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2164.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in a two year election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2165.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I can't see how we can support it legitimately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2169.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4228.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: President, maybe we lost the petitioner, but I just find it, I find it bothersome that again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4236.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: utilities, we seem to have the biggest issues with utilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4240.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they're not here to represent on this petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4244.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I do understand Council nights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4249.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Support of Mr. Randazzo is probably one of the best in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4252.671s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I would say I trust him wholeheartedly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4256.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But there are questions that I would like to ask the petitioner that is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4262.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that would be very important for the residents of that area to make sure they're going to follow through what is asked for in this petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4269.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know this is what was asked by the by the director, but until I have a representative from National Grid that I can talk to, I wouldn't support this tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4278.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Apologize, but no further discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4476.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4478.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4481.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: hope that my fellow Councilors would reconsider their vote for making these changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4489.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've heard from numerous residents of the community and the negative impact it will have for the members of our community to have an opportunity for a voice<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4505.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: publicly is something that would be detrimental to the growth of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4510.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that, again, I reiterate the council's made some great points of our subcommittees and our subcommittees have done some great work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4520.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that you are correct with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4524.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I still think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4525.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we haven't done our due diligence to see what our lives would look like by adding subcommittees on the other days, other than Tuesdays and Wednesdays, to see if we can still maintain the Tuesday night regular meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4541.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for the sake of the public and having that voice as an open forum to share any concerns or discussions they might want to have shared to this council and for any issues that represent our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4559.766s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I hope we can reconsider.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4562.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we've had dialogue, we've had open dialogue, we've shared our concerns,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4571.512s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've agreed to disagree, but I would just hope that we can reconsider and realize how important these Tuesday nights are to our whole community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4580.436s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4947.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Monday, Wednesday,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4950.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thursday, Friday, you could still have subcommittees on those other days, Madam President, thank you in the subcommittee check and call them whenever they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4972.868s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4975.33s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Knight had mentioned that it started here and then it moved to subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4980.692s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So yes, that's here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4982.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now we're eliminating that for two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4984.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's what, and believe me, this is not personal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4989.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I still love Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4990.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll always love Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4992.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is just, again, we agree to disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4996.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I guess the vote will show and we move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5000.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why we love our country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5001.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6689.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Last thing, because I don't know if I missed something because we are all highly educated people behind this rail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6696.859s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't know if I missed this along the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6701.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe one of you can answer this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6702.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we at any time hindering the process of properly having subcommittees<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6710.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: by not allowing a four-meeting month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6716.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is there something that I'm missing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6718.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because everybody keeps saying that we're getting so much done in subcommittees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6722.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're getting so much done in subcommittees, and I totally agree, but I'm just a little confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6726.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody keeps saying this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6728.247s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just need clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6729.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did I miss something in a document that said that we cannot have subcommittees any other day to perform this great work we're all doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6739.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did I miss that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6742.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=635.574s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I just want to thank you too I think this is a difficult position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=645.258s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know when there's ever a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=648.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're always there to help so we appreciate all your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=651.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=834.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like I said, she's probably a wonderful person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=837.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just, if I didn't see a resume or have anyone talking on behalf, I don't know who she is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=842.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if I can, I don't know if we go to committee of the whole, but just to get her information, if there's any way that maybe for next week, if we can, you know, just table to next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=860.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, just to, I'd like to get the background if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=881.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, at least I saw it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=883.293s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I'd be happy to hear from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=884.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, no, if that's the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=885.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just wanted some information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1143.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think what I was saying before it was kind of, it's just, I, it's either we know an applicant or we would read their resumes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1154.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1156.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think I don't need a committee the whole meeting I think that if you read someone's resume I get to see who they were what what their background was I think that would be enough for me so to me to table this until we get just the resume this week to vote on it next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1171.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think it will hold us up that much, but I just think that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1175.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It, to me, that's, you know, we've gone through, like last week, we voted, like I said, I knew a few when I saw our resumes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1182.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to me, that gave me enough confidence with the, you know, the background check that was done by our city administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1193.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that would be my motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1292.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First of all, we've done in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1294.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done in the past is we've seen, like I said, giving you example, Mr. Miller and I've known him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1300.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Personally, I know his background, and I'm confident with what I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1305.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I also, I, other, other, other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1312.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: other participants resumes that to me, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1315.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think just the resume, plus the added vetting of Sandy and her staff and the administration, I think that all I just wanna see is what their background is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1326.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that to me, that's all I need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1329.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's all I would ask for if someone wants to add to that, you're more than welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1333.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But right now, I think a simple, their resume just to get a better idea of what we think personally, I think it's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2441.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So for minutes archive isn't that important, don't you think, is there a way that we can that could be capable of all these meetings that our public should be stored and as part of record correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2489.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: can I make sure that I'll record that with that information that we have this administration just get back to us to make sure we do have that information that that's part of our mission going forward with the new technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2504.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2506.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that something that people get back to us to say, I'd like to see the minutes of the meeting or rerun of the meeting for individual purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2516.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can, that'd be something I'd like the administration to follow up with, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=4403.099s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any further discussion sounds like political theater and the council president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=4647.379s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=4649.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thanks Rick for bringing that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=4650.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know Kenga, you've dealt with a lot of reporters in our days and I think that you have by far been the most fair and we appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=4662.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are times when you don't agree<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=4665.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You disagree, you might disagree what you you right but you are always fair, there's always two sides, and at least you've tried you can see that you made an effort to look at both sides and I think that that's that says a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=4681.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that it makes me angry and sad for the fact that I talked to one of the one of the editors just a few years ago when she told me that the commitment of this newspaper was really to go back to the roots of community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=4695.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here we are looking at the total opposite.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=4698.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will express my displeasure to her personally tomorrow again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=4704.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I won't hesitate to call them a liar because they lied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=4708.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=4710.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They came to me for two reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=4712.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One, as a city councilor and two, covering my position in the neighboring community, where they wanted to maybe push the community aspect and really get really community based.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=4725.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And instead of doing that, they've turned it all around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=4727.814s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now what I've heard from a lot of people, from all sides, it's just, they're all disappointed that there is no,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=4737.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: there is no message to be sent or they can read online or get that paper and share the information that a lot of people still like to get.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=4752.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That newspaper is something that's very important to people's lives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=4755.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And maybe not to the younger generation, but to the older generation, it's a huge part of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=4762.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what they do every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=4763.945s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm sad that we're seeing that go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=4766.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I'm sure you'll do great things at the Statehouse, but I'm not happy about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=4771.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but thank you for everything you've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=54.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=57.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We recently know that we just received information from the mayor's office that they're putting together a task force to look into contract trash removal contract that's up and coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=74.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This resolution was driven for the fact that conversations with people that really aren't truly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=82.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in tune with the recycling format and, and this came about and having conversation my neighbors is, we were looking at what we were, what people were throwing away and how many people don't really use as much trash, and the recycling bin being being overflowing with talking to maybe asking the city to do it twice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=104.233s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, doing it every week with the recycling, and the basic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=110.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: understanding of opening, it sounds bad, but we went through one of my neighbor's recycle bins and it was comical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=118.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They said, I'm a very good recycler.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=120.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know exactly what I'm doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=122.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then you notice that what the rules are and what people don't know in the city of Medford, at least people that really aren't in tune to it, that I gave them an example that they had a pizza box and the pizza box has said, yeah, it's empty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=135.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, we'll see this grease spot on the pizza box.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=139.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Recycling, if you enter that into the recycling in Redemption Center, they take that and they void that whole barrel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=146.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because that grease on that carton voids it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=150.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's really trying to make sure that we have a way to educate all of our constituents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=158.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's nice to think that everybody's in tune to recycling, but not understanding the true rules and what takes and what they don't take and understanding that if they go through something and they see a jar of peanut butter that hasn't been cleaned out,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=175.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that voids the whole barrel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=177.264s">[Scarpelli]</a>: From what I've been told, it's not apples to apples as we look to true data when we go to the contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=186.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the hope is, I saw the contact from the mayor's office and that we're starting, did anybody else get that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=197.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, so they're starting a task force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=199.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think one of the biggest pieces we need is just,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=204.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Part of this is to make a resolution and put it out there that we ask for a process that we find a way to educate our constituents on the do's and don'ts of recycling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=219.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something simple, bullet points, even a one-page tutorial which shows the basic concepts, because I don't think people understand for the fact that what the contract will look like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=233.839s">[Scarpelli]</a>: moving into our next contract negotiations because it's going to be expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=239.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's going to come back to the taxpayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=241.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just want to make sure that I brought that up this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=246.69s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm excited to see that the mayor is already moving forward with this and putting together a task force that's going to be addressing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=253.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just ask that, you know, really an education piece has to be in the forefront.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=258.18s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=353.372s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it would be nice is to share this site this is this is perfect that it realizes that as part of the education piece I think that once, and it's not the people like I said it's not, it's not the person that's really invested in recycling, it's the common person that really doesn't understand, and, you know, when you look at the numbers when it comes down to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=375.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we're losing a lot in trash where people think they're doing the right thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=380.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So education, I think is key.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=817.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam Superintendent, I know that this is something that I think we would be foolish not to support this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=825.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think my biggest, my first question is, when would we know if we would be accepted or what we would be awarded if that's the case?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=837.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do we have a timeline with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=884.981s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=886.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the reason why I bring that up is because of what cuts have is did say that it's definitely will be substantial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=894.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we need to look at is not just the high school, but as we're moving forward other capital projects are other new schools that are new anymore that following disrepair themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=908.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we can go on and on fire station, we could talk about, uh, different city buildings and, you know, other wishes and hopes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=915.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that, um, not, I don't know how I don't want to put this, just I think to put, put the administration on notice that when it comes to money and that vote, we're all would hope we'd all vote unanimously to see where this goes tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=931.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as we move forward, I think it would be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=934.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: travesties that we don't have true numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=936.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you look at what else we have to do in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=940.223s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the worst thing I want to see is, you know, pitting one group against the other what we need, we don't need this in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=948.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that having that capital plan in place so we can look at actual figures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=954.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can make educated decisions when the time comes because I, I certainly don't want to deny it when it comes time for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=961.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: talking about money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=962.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't want to deny it because I don't know what the rest of the needs of the community going to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=968.477s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's all I would ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=970.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, not that it's a warning, but it's just a just to get the word out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=976.142s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=976.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The council says no on a money paper dealing with improvement of schools when we don't know what's happening with the rest of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=983.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would hope that, um, the administration really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=989.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: pays attention to that as we move forward because I, you know, I walked to the school the other day and my daughter goes there and my son graduated there and I coached there for years and it's just can't keep ahead of it, it's just a, it's, it's nobody's fault but times, and it's it's a mess so we know it has to be done there's a lot of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1010.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, I think we're losing our kids now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1011.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think unfortunately we're losing a lot of kids to different school systems, whether it be Matt and on, you know, we will, we all thought just a few years ago, Matt and on was a school of the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1022.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, all of a sudden it's revitalized and we see droves of method kids leaving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1027.107s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's one of the reasons why parents tell me they're leaving is because of you've seen Medford high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1031.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's just.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1033.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: not the way to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1033.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think, you know, we're very fortunate that we have great teachers, administrators at the high school that, uh, make me feel comfortable knowing that my daughter is getting a great education and she's gonna move forward for the next step chapter in her life on a solid footing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1048.661s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But, um, you can't defend some of the things we see with some of the parents that lead for that reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1054.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1056.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope my colleagues all support this and, like I said, when it comes down to the real thing and we start talking about real money that we need to find a way to make sure we fund these, these important issues, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1068.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=2173.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know Mr. Miller is here this evening, but speaking on, for one, Councilor, he's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=2181.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Anything you see with the name Henry Miller and associated has to be something that's upright and and for the best of our communities always been someone that's taken the lead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=2193.824s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There have been times that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=2196.541s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've gotten phone calls from the gentleman and he didn't like what you heard in the other line but it was the truth and it made you open your eyes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=2205.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You wish the city had 1000 Henry Miller and and to see that he steps up again to volunteer to be part of one of the most important commissions that we have in our community is speaks volumes for the gentleman so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=2221.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a no-brainer to support Mr. Miller on this commission, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=4401.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=4404.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=4406.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Vice President Baez, you summarized that in depth and appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=4411.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that again, just to reiterate, unlike what has happened on the school committee side, that the word that keeps coming back out there is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=4420.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're changing the rules to stifle our constituents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=4423.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=4425.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Reiterate what Councilor Beall said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=4428.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This will always have a forum here in this chambers for this council that any participant, any resident of the city can come to that podium and speak on any issue that they think is prudent or they need that to get off their chest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=4444.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that was important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=4446.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The policy is still in place where it's not debatable, but there's a process where if a community member does want something on the agenda to speak and discuss on that agenda we can do that so this is definitely a venue that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=4464.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is still for the people and have options for the people to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=4467.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So other than that, to reiterate the other piece that was out there that has some debate is the amount of meetings per month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=4476.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that there is some debate, whether it's two meetings or bi-weekly meetings, excuse me, bi-weekly meetings or weekly meetings, I still think, and that's still on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=4489.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So other than that, I see everything is in place and I would move for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5276.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5279.272s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President, and thank you, Nina, for being here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5284.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna be consistent with my vote with this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5289.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that when, uh, Madam Mayor was part of this committee, we both agreed and looked at the process of bonding every year of 250 now $1 million for something that, um, I actively at the time years ago, went out and secured a breakdown financial breakdown of, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5314.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a truck, three employees, what it would cost to have three more DPW employees, as other communities have, a sidewalk and hot top crew that work for you year round.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5327.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe at that time it was $250,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5331.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that was a one-time cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5333.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then all that was left was the payment of the three employees for the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5341.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I kept bringing up the same piece if we're going to figure out a way to spend $250,000 and only getting a few sidewalks done, or having no crew for doing hot, hot patch or hot top.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5355.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: pothole remediation that we look into at budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5360.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I put forth the recommendation every year that we input a hot top and sidewalk crew for this reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5369.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so I'll reiterate this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5371.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it needs to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5372.609s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I won't support it because I have historically<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5375.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: said over and over again the redundancy of this this ask could be gone and we could be now looking at a crew of three extra employees in the city that could then assist other departments when needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5390.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many benefits to adding a sidewalk hot top groove that I just think that this is fundamentally fiscally wrong<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5401.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: coming up and asking for bonds every year for 250, 500,000 this year is a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5408.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I can't support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5410.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's the only reason why I think that it's the studies that we brought forth, the numbers we brought forth in the past shows that this doesn't have to be a bonded item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5423.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It doesn't have to be a loan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5426.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this could be a department in our city that would help us throughout the year and fulfilling the need of our community as we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5434.822s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, just wanted to make sure that you knew wasn't nothing personal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5439.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that I've been preaching for since I came on this council years ago that it's, uh, I did my due diligence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5449.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I did my homework.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5450.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I put a few local DPW commissioners put<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5454.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: plans for it that I submitted to the, to the council at the time, the mayors at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5460.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I just think this is, again, it's another, another year that I'll be saying this, a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5467.186s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it doesn't come from the same pool, but a million dollars spent, $250,000 spent one way would save us a million dollar discussion today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5477.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just think it's a redundancy that we don't need anymore in this community with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5482.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5636.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Historically, I've done the homework.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5640.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've mentioned this both as former Councilors and former, like Councilor Caraviello says, this isn't just this administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5648.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's been every administration before that, that we've sat and talked about this and we keep bonding so much money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5655.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then the question comes back at the end of the year, we sit with the DPW director, we say, what do we get done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5660.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, unfortunately the contractors couldn't do this or couldn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5664.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then unfortunately came into the season when we couldn't pour cement anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5668.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we lose our window because we help hold everything out to outside agencies where if we have our own department three person department with our own equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5679.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As soon as the weather breaks and as soon as the cement can cure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5683.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and other communities, boom, they're out there and they're working, they're putting sidewalks in, they're replacing sidewalks and then when cement can't be cured, now it breaks right into the winter season and potholes have to be filled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5695.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those crews that were doing cement sidewalks, they're now filling potholes all over their cities, making sure that that's kept up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5703.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, again, it's, I understand you don't know the history of it and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5707.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's something maybe I should I should touch base the earlier so but I think this is something that I've said over and over again for years that this is something that we really need a dedicated crew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5718.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if I supported this tonight, that would come on budget season and say, well, why would why would we need to look into into hiring our own<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5727.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: cruise if we're going to accept the million dollar bonds every time it comes forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5732.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's why I have to stay away from this and not support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5736.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's the only reason why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5738.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's because it's something that I feel strongly about for many years, not just today, but in many different administrations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5744.911s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, it goes all the way back to the McGlynn era.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5747.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's not that expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5753.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if we could do a cost analysis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5755.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's a little bit more than it was back in the day, but it was one truck and the equipment that was needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5760.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, you know, the only reoccurring cost is the three staff members that could definitely be used in different sections in our DPW when needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5770.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we weren't in season for sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5773.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, thank you for understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=7637.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=7638.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=7642.076s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One thing you haven't seen here in a while is Mr. Eller, and unfortunately, you know why now, and I know he<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=7651.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was a strong man and felt very, very confident in his convictions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=7656.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he wasn't afraid to tell you either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=7659.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He'd look you right in the eye and tell you, you don't know what you're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=7664.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you can't begrudge a person that loves Medford that much in its budget system and the way he wanted to see it run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=7676.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he made you what I liked about Mr. He told you right to your face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=7680.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He didn't, he didn't hide behind anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=7683.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He challenged you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=7684.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, um, you know, he made my knees quiver a few times and some of the questions he's asked me because he was a very intelligent person and, uh, something that, um, one thing you, you can't deny is that he loved metric.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=7698.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, and you could tell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=7700.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: by how many meetings he came and expressed his concerns about this city's fiscal responsibilities and where they were going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=7708.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So he will be missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=7711.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So he is right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=7714.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's did say a lot of it's like Nostradamus of the financial world here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=7719.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but he will be missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=7721.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's condolences to his family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=8068.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we did ask, did you, I guess, I mean, I guess what we heard is that Verizon is working, but there is something going on with Comcast and a piece of equipment at the station that needs to be replaced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=8081.362s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe they're looking into it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=8083.584s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I guess Verizon, you can't see everything's fine, but it's the Comcast connection that they're trying to fix.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=294.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=295.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Knight, for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=299.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: True words couldn't be spoken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=301.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Mosaic is a true gentleman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=303.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you're talking about the last of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=307.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The old guard that I remember in high school where there was a team of maybe six security guards that roam the vast hallways of Medford High School keeping the peace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=320.202s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As time went on,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=322.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Mosaica became the total opposite of what you think a security guard was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=328.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was a person that kids could speak to, a person that when you needed a strong arm, he was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=336.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you needed an ear to talk to, he gave it to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=341.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think every kid that walks the halls at Medford High School, love and respect Mr. Mosaica.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=347.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He is truly a gentleman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=351.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was, I don't think I've ever heard a negative word said about Mr. Mosaic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=355.949s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it is a contentious job, you know, at times you have to be the heavy in the school, where it's a suspension or removal of a student or, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=367.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or a faculty member, Mr. Mosaic was the person that had to be that heavy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=372.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he was always there with respect and kindness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=377.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm glad that he's retiring and I wish him well and his family well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=383.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President, for giving me the moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1222.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1226.453s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Biazzi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1227.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is, I know that you do your due diligence, but again, I've represented myself in the same fashion Councilor Knight has spoken, so it would not be legal to point, but I will not support this paper for those facts as well, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4286.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4287.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is off topic, but I've just received about eight to 10 text messages and emails that again, the system is breaking down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4297.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, people can't watch it's coming in and out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4302.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just wanted to make you aware of that, Madam President, that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4306.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if we can let the administration know that if we could figure this out, because I tried to watch the rest of the meetings last night and a few other meetings, and it was coming in and out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4319.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not to say that it's our professional that's working here tonight's fault, but there's obviously some technical issues going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4329.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's a mess, and this is what's, you know, we need to correct that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4335.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that on this topic, Madam President, I agree with you, but I'm going to stand firm on what I have been voting on for the last few months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4345.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5135.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5135.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Knight brings up some good points, and I won't reiterate them, but I think that there's two very important issues that I received some feedback from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5146.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One being the restaurant owners coming off the pandemic right now, even waiting until 2023 to kick this off, it's still something that they're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5159.814s">[Scarpelli]</a>: little setback and still under the pandemic effects of their financial restraints and that's one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5171.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second, I know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5175.698s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5175.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hunt did a wonderful job presenting and doing the best she could, but after the meeting, I got feedback that I note that she mentioned that only a handful of restaurants returned the surveys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5187.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was notified by about four that were watching the meeting that said they would never even were approached or had any knowledge of a survey that would help us make a decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5203.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as well as what Councilor Knight brings forth, I think it's enough for me to just slow down and try to revisit this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5213.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5412.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The concerns of lack of afterschool programming in our Medford public schools and asking us for some assistance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5424.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've, um, this is my, my, my profession.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5428.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think there's some viable solutions that we can discuss working as a partnership with the, uh, public and, uh, the municipal and the school department as a partnership and working together and creating a revolving account that would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5447.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: put a safe and prosperous program for any of our students that are in need of after-school programming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5457.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've heard a lot of phone calls, talked to a lot of people, and we have some locations that take care of our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5468.313s">[Scarpelli]</a>: excuse me, low income through vouchers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5470.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we have the residents that can pay high fees to that can pay for an after school program, but they're still not reaching all<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5483.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: of those groups, and then there's a group in the middle that's being left out because they do fall in the middle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5491.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there is a process that I'm hoping that if we can amend this, that we would invite all the parents that have reached out to our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5503.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to call for, I know we've asked for a subcommittee meeting, but in the near future to set up a subcommittee meeting for the recreation youth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5511.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if we can meet with the recreation department, someone from the mayor's office, a representative from the school department, if we can, and maybe sit down and put a plan together that we can put a program that would house<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5530.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the needs of our community until, which is the big issue, until we find a recreation facility that other communities have that are fulfilling these needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5541.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if you would indulge me, I appreciate that, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6198.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6200.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And thank you for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6201.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's important, yes, living with an avid marathon runner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6207.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The people that are taking on this massive endeavor is something that I look in amazement and awe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6215.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, Dina took the year off this year and should be back next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6219.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But to all those brave souls that are going to give it a whirl on Monday, wish them good weather and Godspeed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6229.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you and good luck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6474.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6475.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This Subcommittee on Science had tried to do our due diligence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6480.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, both the petitioner, the petitioner hasn't fulfilled<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6486.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: his requirements, so I believe they're trying to set up a meeting with the building department to properly put the paperwork in order and proceed in the correct process that is asked upon them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6499.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we hope to, I believe we tabled that, and we're waiting for future contact with the petitioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6506.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6513.705s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=481.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=482.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=483.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=485.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=486.02s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I apologize, did you say you were handicapped?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=489.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=490.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you have a placard?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=492.747s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And did they put a handicapped spot on that street for you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=511.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope we get to find a resolution for what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=514.18s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our neighbors are going through on Bradley Road, but this is something that as we move forward, I think it's something that we should talk with the traffic commission, maybe hold a meeting with the residents of Bradley Road, because this is something that's been going on for years and no one has listened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=530.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, maybe there's other solutions that we could talk to the traffic commission when the time comes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=534.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So let's hope we can find the resolution for the biggest issue and then revert back and circle back to the traffic commission, because that's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=542.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=712.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=713.268s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=715.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for expressing those concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=718.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I echo all of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=719.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's important that as we as we hear so often, even this evening, that a lot of the issues we're having with parking has nothing to do with method residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=730.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It has people that come outside of method that want to use our recreational spaces or our restaurants or our theaters and, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=740.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and it really displaces the quality of life of our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=744.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can, like Councilor Knight said, you know, in the case that we've had in other locations and it's worked, I think we need to follow up on this stretch of road as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=759.73s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2903.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe, you know, and I'm just saying, and I'm not saying you know maybe we can maybe we can maybe we can ask, I'm assigned to, I know they're thin but with this being such a dire situation having a assigned member for office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2917.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're working directly with the families and the homeowners of Bradley will be an advocate even for the state because you know this is really this is this is getting out of control, but I think with this is such a dire situation I think that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2929.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one of the biggest things is having someone on the other line I think that's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2934.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the least we can do is recommend that, uh, Miss Hunts puts a identified representative from their office that's going to work directly with the people of Bradley Road because of because of this die situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2948.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think they'll block at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2949.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that they'll they'll really work hard to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2952.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2954.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That, you know, where we were handcuffed, at least you should have an avenue within our city hall that are going to at least point you in the right direction and make sure that someone's going to be on the other line because I can't, I can't even imagine what you're going through right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2970.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the stress level, at least we can do is ask the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2973.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to take that stress level out, so they can help you move forward those chores so no thank you if I could recommend that that'd be something that no I appreciate that because you know I did make a call this week and the woman says where you can go live in a shelter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2992.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I think if we can do that, because there are avenues and I know that it's easy for us to sit on this side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3000.47s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's easy because we have, you know, we have homes right now but the idea of what you're going through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3006.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't, we can't say we understand because we don't, but we can also understand that if we can do this and we could follow from what I've, I've talked to a few different attorneys I can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3016.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: By law, I can't tell you I get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3017.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3018.466s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that like Councilmate says, this isn't an easy process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3022.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, and you have to go to even as you as residents there if you take advantage of what we have in the city to finance legal representation that that building can stay the same for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3036.719s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you just what you're doing is banded together that's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3040.507s">[Scarpelli]</a>: have someone direct you from the city to the right avenues and make sure that someone's on the other line and follow through with the resources we can offer you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3048.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that at least gives us some time to find out other ways that we can get to the state and have the state representatives<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3056.272s">[Scarpelli]</a>: look at different options, whether it's finding ways to, uh, you know, work directly with housing within different state housing, um, processes or whatnot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3066.417s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's got to be something out there that, like you said, this is the worst case scenario, and I know what's happening today, and like Councilor Behr says, this is probably the beginning of something more drastic moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3116.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, no, you have every right to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3118.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the reason why we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3119.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We wish we could do more, but we're here to listen and help in any way we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3125.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If this is little that we can do, and at least let you know that you have seven people that understand, excuse me,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3134.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: can be there for you just to listen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3136.764s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the best we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3138.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope that can help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3139.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But listen, I wish I could do more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3143.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wish we could do more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=567.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=569.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wanted to take this time because I was getting some feedback from a bunch of teens that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=577.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: know, I was with my daughter and their friends and we were talking about recreation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=581.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what I found amazing is that when you hear the bad things in Medford, it resonates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=588.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when you hear good things,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=590.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: kind of falls in deaf ears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=591.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you hear what our recreation department's doing, probably our most neediest, most vulnerable community members, you're looking at teens that really don't have a place to go here in Medford, where other communities have bowling alleys or rec centers or boys and girls clubs where they can always have a safe place to just pop in the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=618.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The recreation department at the old high school at the recreation facility, um, has been housing a free team night where kids could just come in and drop, drop in, and they were consistently housing between 70 and 100 teens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=635.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We never heard of an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=636.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We never heard the police say that the teens are out of control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=640.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have seldom heard of any issues of teens walking the streets of Medford and hanging in places they shouldn't because we gave them an opportunity, something as simple as the gymnasium and the classrooms at the Chevalier and the gymnasium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=659.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's paying such great dividends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=662.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=665.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: something that small has made such a huge impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=671.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Looking and sending this to subcommittee, which I chair and sitting down with the director and right away, I heard from the library staff that wants to get involved, knowing that we have a state of the art library and there's possibilities to do programming for teens with the library and looking at future facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=695.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The HECMA Center has come back up and talked of discussions now that there's hope that there's an arts center in our community elsewhere that we can focus on a facility that abuts a playground and it's on a bus route that our kids can find a safe haven to go any day of the week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=717.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, having a location in the middle of Medford Square that our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=723.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: kids and what we've seen is our most neediest kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=727.761s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, our Children that have either single parent or both parents have to work to survive and have nowhere to go and having that location in the middle of method square and giving them that that safe area to traverse to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=745.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=746.456s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm so excited that this is the some of the vision that we looked at years ago when<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=753.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had our committee to put this together to see if it was viable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=756.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one of the things we talked about is sustainability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=760.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we talked about recreation funding itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=764.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what you're seeing with the new, we've hired now a new recreation coordinator, and that person is focused on adult programming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=776.859s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what you're seeing is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=779.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: no wavering in adult program fees, the numbers are through the roof, the money is coming in and it's offsetting other youth programs that really need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=788.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is exactly the vision that started years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=793.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think it's time that we look into the possibilities of moving it forward and having another location, a standalone location,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=806.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: would be an amazing opportunity for our youth and all of us here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=812.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate you listening to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=816.02s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I congratulate our recreation director, Kevin Bailey, and his staff who are doing an amazing, amazing job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=825.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm fortunate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=827.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to be the program developer in a recreation department where I have eight full time program coordinators, a facilities director, a full time administrative assistant and a director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=840.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we have over when during the summer is over 100 part time staff and about 70 of those staff members that are funded by a mass summer jobs program money that's allocated directly to help our teams work through the summer that would allow us to do great things for the kids in the community that I work in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=860.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, this is the path that method deserves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=864.34s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that we have the means we have the ability to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=868.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: do some great things in the next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=871.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm hoping with the subcommittee, the input from our neighbors and our, um, our, our teams, especially because when you listen to your children, the truth is the truth comes out and then you can't, you can't hide from it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=886.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's so important to hear and see the results of what the team night has met on a Friday and Saturday night and the number of kids that have participated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=895.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=897.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for the time and I motion that we have a subcommittee to discuss possible future growth dealing with the recreation program and facilities and hope to have someone from the city administration there, also our director and any of his staff that would like to come and any other city entity that we feel that could really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=926.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: work in collaboration with this group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=928.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, the library being one that we've already reached out to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=932.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1840.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, thank you, Councilor Collins and Councilor Tseng for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1844.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that this is something we've been talking about, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1847.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's, you know, put our money where our mouth is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1850.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now that we have a new diversity director in place and meeting with that individual, I know that especially when we talk about education,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1861.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and you see the diverse student body we have now and making sure that we are focusing on making sure that we have a diverse teacher population.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1874.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So such a diverse community has representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1879.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's so important and making sure that we have qualified diverse candidates<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1884.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1885.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's it's something that we need to see that ball get started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1890.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And these are the dialogues that start that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2214.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I had concerns with the first vote, and I don't believe I supported it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2218.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that a lot of questions came about and still have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2224.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know you're saying it's been up and running for a few months, but I'm getting copies of residents that come and get permits, and they're getting permits handwritten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2251.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the visitors permits as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2259.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, when they come to the office, we take a hint we take<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2263.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a document with our seal, traffic parking seal, and we handwrite.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2286.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, this is my problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2289.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Without seeing a plan, without understanding or vetting that plan and not understanding it and getting it started and now asking for more money,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2300.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can't support that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2302.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I still don't understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2304.859s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There hasn't been a community discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2308.261s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The community hasn't understood what's going on with our traffic and parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2313.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe the people that are invested, they're involved, but this is everyone in our community, and we have questions, and the questions haven't been answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2325.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that Councilor Caraviello is getting the same phone calls I got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2329.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, we're not being in a point to answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2333.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Look, ask those questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2334.78s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know how we can approve, um, money's going forward if we can't ask questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2339.763s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, I'm gonna decide here to answer your questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2887.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2888.16s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2891.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The animosity is you have the director of the parking traffic and parking the other representative here to answer our questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2898.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so the question isn't being nasty to say that this isn't this should ask the treasure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2905.373s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is this is your city council asking the director to get word back from the treasurer what the common practices is so we can make a better decision for traffic and parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=3293.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the comments you just made because this is what we're trying to get at, but instead you could feel tension as if we were against you or you were against us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=3303.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You made some very clear concerned issues that we don't know about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=3309.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we ask for a plan, the plan is so we can help disseminate the word to the people that call us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=3317.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when I get an email that shows me a handwritten<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=3321.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is this is where our money is going with that traffic and parking, I wouldn't know, because we don't know the plan of what's going forward in our own city departments that you're here asking for money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=3334.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these are the concerns we have nothing negative I know, I know how hard you work, and I know how difficult it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=3341.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Believe me, I work in a city that has<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=3346.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 30 PCOs and have eight clerks at the window.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=3350.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I understand exactly how monumental this is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=3355.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But unless we all understand where we're going and what plan we have or where we are today, these are the concerns we have from the people that call us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=3365.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And listen, we know you're getting phone calls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=3368.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's inevitable because people say, I just try to call Faye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=3372.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, really?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=3375.268s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and I understand that there's only one person but at the same time, there has to be a plan that we could follow that we're all in the same dialogue, and separate from that, do we have just to achieve a step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=3388.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we don't collect credit cards from any other department recreation permitting, we don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=3394.575s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have that in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=3419.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So yeah, do it online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=3420.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, but you can't come to window.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=3422.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, that's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=4120.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=4121.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the $45,000 would staff these remaining positions for the rest of this fiscal year is that we're looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=4129.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, and then the addition for these positions, do we have a figure for what that would look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=4135.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If that's in the budget for next year and additional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=6295.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd be remiss to say the direct correlation with the addition of Councilor Tseng and myself in the passing of the movement of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=6309.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I want to know all joking aside, this obviously was a very planned out and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=6318.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: long process by former Councilors and Councilor bears vice president bears to put a product that we can all look at and move forward with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=6328.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that having all of the department heads involved that are directly involved in the constituents that shared their input I think was also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=6340.223s">[Scarpelli]</a>: amazing to watch for our first meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=6342.766s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just wanted to pat on the back to Council Biaz and Councilor Falco and Marks that were part of that committee that started this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=6352.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=6355.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=597.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, thank you, Madam President again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=598.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I echo the sentiments from my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=603.436s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, Council Falco, former Council Falco president and Council marks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=609.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know spent a lot of time with this, uh, this, uh, initiative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=615.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, um, I'm also very proud of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=618.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=619.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When the administration allows this body to look at representation, like attorney burrows key and having his leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=630.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=632.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've been, we've been in forums of other attorneys, but to work with Mr. Brabowski and his wealth of knowledge and the pieces that he shares from other communities that he has, he has fought with and, and changed so many, so many guidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=649.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that, uh, you know, without him, um, I don't know if it would have been, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=656.714s">[Scarpelli]</a>: can't say easy because it's been two years, but he really made it very educational and we appreciate his leadership with this process and we look forward to moving this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=670.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5073.474s">[Scarpelli]</a>: approval pending commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5197.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5199.274s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I reiterate what my colleagues have already said but again, when we talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5206.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the members of our community that have given so much and now have left us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5212.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And for one, Mrs. Carroll has handed those traits off to her children and Omari is always the first one to step up when the city's in need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5224.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I remember the process when the food truck at the fundraiser for the Andrew School backed out, Omari quickly jumped in and offered<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5236.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: fundraiser for the Children of the Andrews right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5240.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's typical for what the Carroll family has done for years, and she will definitely be missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5244.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we send our condolences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5245.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5619.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you again, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5620.953s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for Councilor Caraviello for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5624.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Casey, another strong member of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5628.64s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that he raised a great son in Joey that now gives his life and his profession as the Medford police officer, and he will be missed in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5640.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So send his deepest condolences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=192.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=193.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Brennan, for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=195.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I do see your paperwork is all in order and it's acceptable in my eyes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=202.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we have a few questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=205.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The location being one, I know there's some confusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=207.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It says 177 College Ave, Mr. Brennan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=210.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that located inside?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=213.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: facility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=223.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, and it obviously will be open for the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=228.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And not students that was a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=233.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What are the what are the hours of operations you're planning on having.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=254.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, and there's, I see everything's in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=257.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that one of the biggest issues in that area is traffic and that has been approved with no hindrances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=263.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=267.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I open the floor to my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=269.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=341.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=397.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=399.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=517.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=270.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for tonight to bring this forward I think that what a fitting couple to make sure that we acknowledge such a momentous occasion, and especially for Maureen, I think to be married to a gentleman like Jim for for 30 years that that's just amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=288.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's just, just an amazing feat and she should be commended and, and obviously I joke<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=297.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Jim's a great guy, and does a lot for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=300.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is, these are the type of people that make Medford the great city that we live in today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=305.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just great members, great neighbors, great community, great community members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=310.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=311.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=447.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, thank you, Councilman for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=450.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think between the Heath's and the Finnegan's, I think that there's a common bond here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=457.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Two couples have been married 20 plus years and also members of our community that are great examples of what a backbone of family people are all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=469.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a good example of how to give back to the community and still maintain such a strong marriage and families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=476.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I congratulate them and wish them happy 20.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=480.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=586.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=587.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thanks, Councilor Caraviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=589.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that shouldn't have gone unnoticed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=593.223s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when you have someone like Larry, he's been the the common denominator for politics in this hallowed hall, and we appreciate everything he does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=605.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I know he had a long street going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=609.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: before that ice storm left a few Fridays ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=611.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was pretty disappointed that he didn't make the trek out in two inches of ice and had to deliver on Saturday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=619.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I could just ask if he could maybe bring a treat for now on so Gabby doesn't rip the couch apart when he drops off our papers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=627.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I second the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=629.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Larry and move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=633.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council Scarpelli, would that be something that he could put in his expense report that you know what, forget it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=639.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=640.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just, you know, as a new Councilor I wanted to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1234.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: always giving back and definitely be missed and send our condolences to the Bolden family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1243.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1305.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1305.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If the petition to come on up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1313.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Welcome, thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1315.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It looks like, Madam President, all of Mr. Pham's paperwork is in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1323.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the hours of operation, Mr. Pham, do you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1327.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, from 10.30 to 10 every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1328.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 10.30 to 10 Monday through Sunday?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1332.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, they do delivery as well, is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1335.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't do it now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1336.048s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1336.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, how many employees will be working there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1339.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right now it's four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1340.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Four, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1341.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see everything in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1342.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know my fellow councilors might have a few questions, but I move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1360.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: See you in a few days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1394.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Reviewed all the paperwork.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1395.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we have, it looks like everything is in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1402.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Menon, is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1404.29s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1404.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we talked a little bit before the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1406.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He, you know, unfortunately, the only sad part about this is it's crumbled cookie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1412.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but again, we, again, we see everything in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1416.764s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What are the hours of operations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1424.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, I know that it's a very popular place and it will be a well addition, an added addition to our community so if my colleagues don't have any questions I move approval tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1469.509s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1469.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what would I have to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1471.169s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would do is see the clerk tomorrow, file for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1474.77s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then you come back in front of the body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1476.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Usually we approve it and maybe a 30 day review, 90 day review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1480.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if there are no issues, we continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1482.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't see it being a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1483.512s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1484.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1484.532s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1486.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I move approval to 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock, excuse me, 11 o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1504.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He didn't mean that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2010.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A sad day, Mr. Boyd was a true hero, a veteran, someone who loved Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2020.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. and Mrs. Boyd had two children and they raised them to love the city of Medford and love their country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2028.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's one thing, if you know Buzzer and you know Billy, that's what they're all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2033.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Billy and I were classmates at Medford High School in class of 87 and nobody could,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2039.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nobody could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2040.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nobody could tell Billy he could bring his trumpet to any event and play the fight song.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2046.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's something that Mr. Boyd instilled in his children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2050.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he'll be sadly missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2052.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that he's gone through a tough time the last couple of years, but he was definitely a fighter and appreciate everything he's done for our community and our country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2065.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we send our condolences to the Boyd brothers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2070.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: wish them well, it's difficult times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3007.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President and thank you for being here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3010.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, the question I have is, I work in municipality, and I work as the acting director of recreation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3018.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one thing we're seeing is we're seeing a huge gap with parents going back to work and being home that had young children that had coverage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3028.494s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now that moving out and you have both parents with two family house that children left without assistance after school and something that we're working on in my community that I'm working in, but something that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3042.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the Director of Recreation, Kevin, is working right now with one of the phone calls, a bunch of phone calls we've received about the same issue, which is the voucher, the families that have voucher programs are being accepted into afterschool programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3059.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then you have the families that have funding to pay the expensive fees for an afterschool program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3066.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what's left now is a huge gap<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3069.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: of families that really never needed after school care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3074.888s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're seeing a huge disparity now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3077.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll be working closely with with the director and working with him and sharing some of our ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3084.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that in in my community where I'm working, we're actually<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3090.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: taking over an afterschool program for low-income middle school boys and girls, and we're hoping to use the ARPA money to assist us with those gaps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3103.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the question I have, would that be something that the parents and the director could come to the body and ask for assistance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3112.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Does that fall into the category here in Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3113.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that something that we're looking at as you see these concerns that we're seeing and these gaps now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3127.969s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3129.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's great to you so it's going to be this I appreciate the presentation because you really shared a lot here and it's something that I think as we move on to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3137.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's something they can they can use in different departments can use to assist to fill in those gaps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3142.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know I'll be bothering the chief of staff in the mayor's office and asking to assist in any way I can to help with that gap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3150.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate all your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3152.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think this is I know that Council B has brought up a very, very good point where it's the hidden, you know, everybody thinks that we're getting every penny is going to go to everything we need is going to fix everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3163.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we should really understand where that money's coming from where it's already earmarked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3167.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3167.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But thank you again for all your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3169.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3193.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm sure that's easy to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3194.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4125.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4128.236s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4128.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I unfortunately missed it, and I appreciate the understanding from my fellow Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4136.099s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, my son was injured while at school in Maine, and I was on call to pick him up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4145.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They wanted him off campus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4146.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's fine, thank God.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4148.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's no issues, but it was something that was unexpected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4152.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4155.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You love Netflix social media but we got beaten up pretty good about it but I appreciate your comments, Madam President, and just so everybody knows family does come first and this council's view in life so if I heard anybody's feelings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4172.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for the situation that I went through with my child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4177.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I truly feel for those people that didn't understand the situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4183.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and pretty disgusted in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4186.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4187.187s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And thank you for my colleagues for understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4496.076s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would second that but thank you Madam President again for our committee on the CPC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4501.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that they do an amazing job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4503.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that when the, the judgment that comes through the community that's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4511.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a little bit before the gun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4513.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're always willing to listen and calm the community down about different petitions that are in front of them and give great examples why we move forward, why we not, we don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4524.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I see that all these initiatives that we all voted favorably for are something that's really gonna enhance our community in a great way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4531.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would second that motion for Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4699.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you Madam President to indulge me just for a quick moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4703.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A few weeks ago we had a horrible car accident on Harvard Street, and the young lady.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4713.922s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Brooke Roselli was injured and is going to go through a very difficult time forward and I know that the community has really supported the Roselli family and helped in every way possible and I know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4730.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: very appreciative, but I know the community is putting together a night for Brooke to help with any of the facilities that might be needed as she comes home, hopefully soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4743.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But on April 7th, they're doing an evening for Brooke from 5 to 10 at Premier on Broadway in the Somerville Method line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4752.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it'll be a nice event to support a young lady who did the right thing and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4759.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: took an Uber out on a Saturday night and and responsibly came home and unfortunately was was struck and has gone through some serious medical issues and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4771.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, kudos to Medford police that they really went forward and hunted this culprit down enough that he came out of the woodwork and turned himself in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4781.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but Brooke is a fighter and she's a survivor and she's gonna need our community's help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4789.613s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this would be a great event for everybody to turn out and support her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4793.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for indulging my two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4796.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=165.814s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President, and I've<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=169.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: gone through all of the paperwork.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=171.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We find everything in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=173.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, I know that I've talked to a few, and it's my neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=178.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've talked to a few of Mr. Mel guys neighbors, and they are very pleased of how he's running the business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=185.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I haven't heard him negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=188.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=189.33s">[Scarpelli]</a>: any negative banter in any way from his business location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=194.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that what he's asking for, I would support and just put a 90 day review on this process as we normally have done with most of these requests that we give Mr. Malgar the opportunity to open from 11 to two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=215.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And after the 90 days, we revisit to see if we've had any concerns or issues from the neighbors or police or anything like so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=225.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would move to approve with the 90 day review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=299.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you understand the question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=300.544s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just, I mean, I would do a delivery only the late night after 11.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=305.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so the question was, are you planning on mostly having like Grubhub combined take food, or is it gonna be mostly people coming in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=314.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What do you envision?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=315.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People walking in at two in the morning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=346.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry, can you say that again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=347.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the question he said, would you be amenable to, if his request is that you do delivery only from Monday, Monday through Friday, Monday through Thursday, and then from 10 to 11 to two, just do delivery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=361.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then on Friday and Saturdays, open till two o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=365.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct, correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=366.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Would you do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=366.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I will do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=368.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that correct, Councilor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=398.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you to review for the Mr. Mel guy, what counsel nights asking if it's okay that we do a 90 day review that you on Friday and Saturday say open till two, but Sunday through Thursday, you do only delivery from 11 to two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=416.105s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=416.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=417.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then as that goes, then we can revisit in 90 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=420.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's saying if we, if that, if it shows that there's a need, is that okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=427.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm amenable to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=438.351s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As conditions and so I yield to Council night's motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=442.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the petitioner will accept that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=445.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=447.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it could be something we can work on, then revisit again as you need to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=452.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=837.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=840.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you again, just to be redundant because you deserve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=844.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that Lasky family in general, what you always give back to the community, not only that in your professional life, you've always looked out for Mr. Lasky and it's something that we're grateful for and having, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=858.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, you're a better half working with our children, and you'll always see Mrs. Lasky in the garden.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=866.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I always remember seeing Mrs. Lasky at the McGlynn Garden, and the pride and joy of that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=872.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that having you reappointed would just keep this moving forward in a positive way, and I support Councilor Caraviello's motion as well, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=959.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and Mr. Huckings raised Debbie, John, Bobby, and Laura, and just wanted to reach out and give a moment of silence for Mr. Huckings' passing and wish their family deepest and sincere condolences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=978.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2718.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2720.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2722.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2726.526s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2729.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can completely understand why Councilor Tseng would like to see this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2733.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that, I think that in totality, what this resolution says is that, let's ask the chief to gather data on Medford so we can educate and look into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2748.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I've also, after reading this, I've contacted a few other colleagues in neighboring communities<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2755.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that had similar concerns and what was the outcome of those concerns were totally against what everybody was saying that it was really race related in the sense that how those numbers were attributed, how they were counted, how it was looked at that Medford looks at this as racial disparity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2779.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think the numbers will show<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2783.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With what we're asking for that the chief, sit down and look into this process and look at the true data for Medford, not the state because the state's going to show a drastic agreeance what what we're saying because it's, this is definitely an issue in the state, but when you're talking about more method I think that I welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2803.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the process that our chief looks into the data a little bit with the magnifying glass to give us the true numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2811.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I also understand that what Councilor Caraviello was saying in the sense that I was getting the same phone call saying, why is Councilor Tseng saying that, you know, our police are racist or they're being stopped and that the presumption of, you know, how you interpret the resolution<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2833.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is how people are gonna read it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2835.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Be a further result of the Method Police Department consider holding a community forum on traffic stop issues in order to deepen community trust and public safety as recommended by the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2845.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that you're on the right track, but I think before we leap to anything negative connotations, I think that we asked the chief to come in and do a data driven report that states<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2860.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what's going on in Medford, because I don't disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2863.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The numbers are gonna show statewide where you're getting, what these traffic stops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2871.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There is a concern, but I also will think that we'll have a better understanding when the police department, the traffic department does a deeper study in the data in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2883.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just, like I said, no one's questioning the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2890.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, unfortunately, there's racism everywhere, and there are good and there are bad everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2896.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2898.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I wanna make sure that we look at this in totality, that I think we really ask the chief to come in to find these numbers before we can all jump and leap to conclusions that, yes, our police force is racist, which isn't what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2913.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2914.436s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but at the same time, it's also give us a true indication of what, what our method stops have been, not just for this year, because you could look at one year and get an understanding, but I think we have to look at method stops over three to five year period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2928.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that'll help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2930.02s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And listen, if that unearths something that's alarming to this council, I think we move forward in a more aggressive manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2935.821s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But until that time, I think, you know, let's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2939.716s">[Scarpelli]</a>: let's ask the chief to do his due diligence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2942.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would recommend that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2943.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's part of the motion, but I just reiterate that motion that we asked the chief to give us more data on traffic stops, not just for this year, maybe going back two or three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2955.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I know that what was said in different communities, the numbers were a little skewed because last year during the pandemic year, you had comparison to 800 stops in one community that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2968.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: previous years that 3200 stops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2971.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it'd be interesting to see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2972.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=3068.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I, I shared the sentiments of Council beers because like I said I reached out to colleagues in different communities are going through a similar resolution and concerns and issues and, and what, what was brought back to me were the concerns<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=3082.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the state numbers and how it was represented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=3086.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's why having the chief come in and giving us true data what's happening in Medford, with what we're looking at, which is what you're asking the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=3096.099s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's important to get that data and numbers, the data doesn't lie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=3100.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's one thing about working in a community like Somerville and having summer stats tell you what you're doing right and wrong every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=3107.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The data drives a lot of what is the true definition of what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=3112.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So like I said, all I'm saying is having the chief, giving him the information, asking him to compile that information for what we want, we're looking for in Medford, not for what's been questionable in other communities, but the numbers that came from the state that are a little skewed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=3127.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're both saying the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4156.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4157.289s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4157.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4157.93s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4158.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4158.65s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4159.33s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4159.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4160.311s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4160.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4161.071s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4161.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4173.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: does do a data dive with these concerns, I think we'll be pleasantly surprised with what our officers are doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4183.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so, you know, and I understand that these are the questions that were also put forth with different communities that numbers might've been skewed in the state level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4195.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's why it's important that we get the numbers from the chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4199.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why I'll support this because again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4202.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the chief will look at methods numbers and get back to us and educate us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4206.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, if we find something that with method numbers that we have to be, we have to now be cognizant and look forward to directing the chief where we need some support or assistance that we change something that might be hurting our community, then we need to fix it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4222.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that welcoming the data is gonna be what we're looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4226.714s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, I think we're all looking at the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4229.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We all wanna see the data and it's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4232.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's not for the gotcha game, it's just to get the numbers and let's go from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4236.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think the chief will welcome it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4238.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we know the chief, he loves these type of issues where he'll answer these questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4246.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's never, from what I recall, the chief has never shied away of questions like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4253.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I pose that in support, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4851.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I thank Council, it's thanks for bringing this forward, but again, I'm going to stay with my vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4856.509s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate, I support my Haitian community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4858.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've done a lot for my Haitian community, but at the same time, I'll be voting no on this resolution for the fact that I'd like to see this council work closer with our Haitian community in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4869.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as I talked to a few of our Haitian leaders, it's ceremonial, but I'm done doing ceremonial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4876.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: votes, and I appreciate that, and I hope you can respect that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4879.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=6104.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=6106.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just to be clear, symbolism is important, but when we present symbolic gestures on a weekly basis, more than once, more than twice, all they are is symbols and empty words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=6120.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To say that a council that maybe tonight will vote no on the symbolic resolution, but doesn't want to see movement is a total farce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=6129.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we have tried to see,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=6132.917s">[Scarpelli]</a>: waited for action in so many ways in the last eight months, and truly have seen nothing but more round table discussions and actual lack of hands on, feet on the ground, getting things done for our community members that have struggled so vitally in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=6153.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I'm gonna say this, I support my Haitian community, I support the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=6164.258s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the movement and anything we can do to help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=6166.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, when we keep sending out symbolic resolutions, they fall on deaf ears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=6175.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when it comes time that this council really needs the state delegates or our federal delegates to really understand that we support something that we truly need, this community truly needs, because there's something truly glaringly wrong<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=6191.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we just fall back on another symbolic resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=6196.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, that's why, again, why I'm voting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=6199.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not that I don't wanna see movement, because that's an absolute farce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=6202.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've lived our lives doing this for people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=6206.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just think that, careful with the comments, because it's, moving on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=6214.526s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=6463.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, respectfully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=81.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=84.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see that the information that we requested over the last two weeks was answered by our building department, Mr. Moki.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=94.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We find everything in order, I move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=488.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=489.186s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate residents that have reached out to me that had some concerns and wanted me to put this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=496.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: have gone by that property probably every day over the last three months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=501.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've talked to the building commissioner this morning and the squatter situation has been taken care of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=510.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They make sure that they have regular police presence to make sure that doesn't happen again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=514.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was happening, but now has been resolved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=519.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The project, as you can see, has now started back up prior to this being<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=525.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: written.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=525.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they're now back to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=528.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe what I was told was the historical commission froze the permit because of some clerical or some changes that were made that weren't approved by their office that has since been approved and they've moved forward with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=543.541s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think the biggest piece that we see as much as we don't, we might not agree or like the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=552.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the look of the building where it's higher and it's longer and it really takes away the look of the neighborhood for what was there prior.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=563.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's nothing we can do with the zoning that was in place that was approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=568.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what we can do is find a way to hold developers accountable for what's being done in our neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=578.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Granted, they have the position to go in and build<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=581.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as long as they follow the proper protocol and zoning requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=586.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But there's still requirements that have to be maintained when it's dealing with neighbors and trash and possible dangerous situations with open areas, where there's construction equipment, where there are ladders, where there's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=607.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a development that's not enclosed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=609.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what we're doing is for this developer, and they're not here today, so I won't bring up their name, but they've also done a few other jobs, developments in the community, where I've had complaints with what this company and this developer has done with the lack of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=633.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: neighborhood cohesiveness and understanding what the neighbors should be notified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=643.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they haven't done that and they've been very rude and disrespectful and that's not the way we should do business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=649.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So unfortunately, some of the concerns have been answered with no apparent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=662.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: punishment or halt of this project, but at the same time, we can ask for them to come to the city council and a committee, the whole meeting with the building department and this council that we start to look at drafting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=682.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: either policies or ordinances that would protect our neighbors when developers come into those neighborhoods and affect them in such a negative way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=691.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we have a few neighbors that are here tonight that would like to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=696.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If my colleagues don't have any other questions right now, I think that the neighbors words speak volumes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=705.859s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=707.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=709.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=728.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, I think it's twofold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=730.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we can ask them, but they don't have to show up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=733.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: From what I've gathered, that we can request for them to come, but the likelihood of them showing up will be,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=742.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: would not happen, but I wouldn't mind getting this developer that's working in our community there to answer the questions for those neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=753.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But moving forward, I think we should look down the line to put a committee together or a community whole meeting together to look at with the city solicitor and see what kind of, in the building department, to see what kind of rules or policies we can put in place that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=769.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that really haven't been followed by these developers as they're moving through metrics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=773.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So does that make sense?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=870.351s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know, Mr. President, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=872.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, there are rats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=875.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, and I did talk to the building inspector that what we can do is we can request and amend this resolution that we have the building inspector go out and visit the site and give us even a weekly update so we can make sure that they're being held accountable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=895.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I know, but that's not their job, but we can't we can't do is we can have them go by even on a.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=901.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, surprise visits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=904.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, throughout the week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=906.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, just even if it's just a pop in so we can ask them if they can do that if we can amend that Mr. Clark, and I have their workers climbing around the roof, no safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=915.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a lot of questions about safety and OSHA and they fall on the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=920.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we did talk to the building inspector and he's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=925.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, with this motion, hopefully he can come out there and if he sees that, he can stop that, you know, due to unsafe practices and stop that project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=935.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate bringing this forward and I'm sorry you're going through that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=941.474s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about the sightline and unfortunately, the zoning in the area, he explained that it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=948.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It definitely it looks like a monstrosity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=951.459s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It doesn't belong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=952.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=953.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It looks more like a like an apartment building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=959.164s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I apologize for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=960.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But unfortunately, this legally, there's nothing we can do that I know as they move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=964.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I this is this disheartening, disheartening piece of government when<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=972.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's nothing else we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=973.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He doesn't, the developer doesn't care about, he cares about the bottom line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=978.574s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He wants to get in and get out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=981.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but we can hold them accountable for the cleanliness, making sure that, you know, that they're providing safe conditions for employees and making sure that it's the cleanliness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=993.258s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if there are rats there, that they're making sure that we can look at putting in some sort of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=998.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: policy that they have to put an abatement process in for roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1003.02s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Downsized the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1004.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, we asked this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1005.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1007.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that's that's that's tough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1008.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I apologize for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1010.362s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we will get to the city city building inspector and hopefully they get out there tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1017.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1018.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You'll hear from Mrs. Ryan, I'm sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1051.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1052.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any of the snow in front or on the side of that, of that particular we have an ordinance that that is certainly a violation of the city we're gonna add that to the, to the, to the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1061.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1062.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1239.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1241.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Nai, for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1242.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we should celebrate this, but if you can help me out, the criteria, Councilor Nai,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1249.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it classified as a hospital anymore?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1252.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it just healthcare?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1254.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How is it defined?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1259.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1701.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilman, for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1703.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we're working as a chair of the Subcommittee on Signs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1707.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're working on setting a meeting right now, but another concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1713.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we could rectify that request and have them in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1721.717s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think it's important we do that because it sounds like there's a public safety and public nuisance issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1728.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1730.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I second the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1927.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1947.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1947.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1949.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: just to beg the mayor and the administration to please find another firm that Medford has a standalone legal team or a city solicitor someone that's going to show that this is a true concern for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1967.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we do lose, if they do build this and we lose the most valuable piece in our community right now, especially in our downtown, which is the Chevalier and crippling that facility in any way will be devastating for this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1984.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, we've been all talking about the revitalization Method Square, redeveloping Method Square, and the biggest piece of that was surrounding it around the Chevalier and the shows that happened at Chevalier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1997.164s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're finally getting past the pandemic issues that we can stop bringing in more shows on a regular basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2003.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to make sure that Medford, the city of Medford, its own entity, stands up and files suit<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2015.34s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as its own entity, not as a partner with our vendor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2019.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have to stand alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2021.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll support the $2,500 because that is nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2024.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know what, you know, I think it's more symbolic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2027.177s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that, you know, it's important, but I think more importantly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2033.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We as a community we as a city as administration have to stand up and say that we are hiring this law firm to represent the city of Medford in this legal battle that is unjust and as as funny as you can, you can talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2050.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because what the neighborhood agreement that everybody agreed upon, they're finding ways to circumvent that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2056.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's going to hurt many communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2058.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But more importantly, it's going to hurt our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2061.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if we don't have someone at that table, representing the city of method as its own entity, then we're not really showing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2070.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not showing the Gaming Commission, we're not showing Wynn, we're not showing Encore, we're not showing the city of Everett, that the city of Medford is willing to put a fight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2079.969s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, we spent a lot of money on legal battles that we know we're gonna lose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2085.148s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this situation, we need to make sure that we beg the mayor to come to us with a paper if she needs to be, that we support any initiative that we have a standalone legal team fighting for this cause.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2101.293s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2102.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor, for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2104.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=195.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh Chair, still in doubt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=196.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, you know, is the legal representation, is Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=201.297s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Scanlon on or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=202.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Mulkey on tonight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=206.045s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because unfortunately I hate to hold our petition up again, but it is a valid question that we needed answered for tonight's meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=214.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe we actually put in the resolution that it was date determined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=220.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was, you know, we were pretty strict about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=223.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're under the assumption that would the chief of staff know any way to, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=232.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: find a way to contact either the city solicitor or Mr. Mulkey to get on the call later on this evening so we don't have to do another night and just table this for later on in the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=245.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=254.107s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=255.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm in total.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=256.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is there a way to reach out to the city solicitor to see if they can answer that question or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=269.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll do that right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=271.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hate to waste the petitioners another week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=274.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that it's a question that's a legitimate question that we need before we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=284.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=287.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At the table until we get communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=290.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if you could just ask the petitioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=299.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, just so the petitioner knows, we're just waiting for what we're asking for from the legal department to let us know that we're taking the proper course so that doesn't affect you moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=313.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're just waiting for someone if they can call us before the end of the meeting tonight, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=317.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=398.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Knight, for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=399.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I honestly, I thought that if he doesn't mind me adding my name to this resolution, I thought I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=404.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm very close friends, graduated with the sun common.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=408.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and friends with his daughter, Fran.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=411.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Palmisano was bigger than life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=413.584s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was that type of life of the party that worked for years for the Duck Tours and was a legend there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=421.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Always a person to make other people laugh and make other people feel comfortable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=427.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Another member of our community that had a battle of devastating illness and unfortunately,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=437.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: passed on that with the major suffering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=445.911s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's something that, you know, you wish you could take away, but I know that he's not in pain anymore and he's in a better place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=452.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And for his family, you know, Method residents who grew up and loved our community and, you know, raised by his wonderful parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=464.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: their wonderful parents and Mr. Parmigiano was definitely the anchor of that family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=469.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So some of that will be missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=471.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I condolences to the Parmigiano family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=896.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would second that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=902.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=903.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=906.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First, I'd like to thank, I know there's a group of residents that are actively taking a role in making sure that this is presented the right way so it's sent to the state in the most positive light moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=929.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I was first elected, one of my first<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=934.079s">[Scarpelli]</a>: one of my first initiatives was looking at the charter view and making sure that we could revisit something that we haven't seen in so many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=940.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that had changed with me last time we voted, I voted no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=947.268s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the reasons were very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=951.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was so simple that what was asked for was yes or no and move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=958.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's important that as you talk about a commission,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=962.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One of the biggest things I think needs some debate is the understanding of ward and precinct representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=969.822s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that sounds so easy for everybody and there are definitely some pros in that aspect of making sure that each ward are represented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=983.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: speaking for myself, working in a municipality in a community that has ward and precinct representation, I see a lot of negative affects of that situation where it becomes a special interest option, special interest groups around the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1001.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I see is a lot of negativity in the sense that you have one community member and one part of the community holding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1011.636s">[Scarpelli]</a>: their colleagues hostage in for what they want their initiatives to move forward not what's greater for their community as a whole, but for their small piece of the community and you could, I saw negative effects, a few times that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1027.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It didn't, it didn't help the community, and, and that's because of that and you know some other options that when you know you get a phone call from someone from South Medford or get a phone call from someone from West Medford or someone from the Walton Glenwood area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1046.548s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I work just as hard as if it was someone in my own backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1050.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it gives people the opportunities to call seven different Councilors to really push an initiative, or a concern that they're not following so I see the benefits there I know that there are benefits to go through with it to look at that but again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1067.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when it was first presented as charter change or charter review, it was cut and dry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1073.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had a great discussion with some members of the committee and talking about having a forum where we could discuss these options, where it's more of a thought process that it's discussed, it's understood, and maybe moving forward, it could be something that as you go forward with the initiative,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1095.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and what you're looking for for charter review, at least.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1099.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: every piece is broken down and discussed and then thought upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1106.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but I do think these, as we move forward with this initiative, I think that I would support it now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1116.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would move forward, I think, but it's also a lot of questions that I think that we should really meet together with the administration and the committee members that are looking to form this commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1129.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: um meet in the community the whole meeting and iron out any concerns and issues and then bring this forth with the with the solid base so we can move forward with the vote of seven zero to go to um the state house so we have no issues or concerns because i think that was the biggest thing as we move forward in the past it was unanimous<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1150.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: support from a council to the State House saying we all support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1154.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that, you know, making sure that we have all of our questions answered and all of our I's dotted and T's crossed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1163.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think moving this to a committee of the whole in a relatively short period of time that we can get all the stakeholders in this room to discuss all the questions and then put this forth to a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1176.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And later on they<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1177.814s">[Scarpelli]</a>: next meeting so we can find a way to move forward in a seven zero vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1182.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would, I would recommend that tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1184.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's an emotion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2603.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, they're tied up with the family situation right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2607.666s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't wanna waste, I don't wanna have you sitting here wasting the rest of your evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2611.949s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can ask the clerk to have the answer reported back to the council and have someone from the city solicitor's office on the meeting for next week so we can get this taken care of and the answer that Councilor Knight can move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2628.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You can come forward if you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2630.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2656.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know, but it's a way that the permit process, the way it goes through, it has to be asked the proper way, and the way that it was asked leaves doubt, and not anything that you did, it was- I mean, I'm just an immigrant from Albania coming to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2669.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, no, I know, and we wanna-<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2672.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't, we don't want...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2675.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now you're out of line right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2676.999s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're way out of line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2678.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If that's what you want, you're voting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2679.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You won't win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2680.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll tell you what, you're out of line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2682.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm trying to be kind to have you understand the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2684.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This has nothing about you or race.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2686.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For you to say that, you're out of line, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2693.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I move to continue this until next meeting, have a representative from the law department to answer this question that has something simple to do with the process, has nothing to do with you or the permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2708.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It has the process that leaves it in doubt, the way it was presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2712.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all it was, has nothing to do with the existing permit or anything moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2716.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To tell you the truth, I don't think anybody in this, including the question from the council who asked that we're not going to support this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2723.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've always supported our business owners, whether you were Italian or Irish or whatnot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2729.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you, there's a question that if we proceed with this, Mr. Abazi, and later we found out we made a mistake, that could affect your business and stop it then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2739.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we don't want that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2740.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's the reason why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2741.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2751.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I completely understand, but like I said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2777.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2779.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2783.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, we're saying that, listen, when we put this out for you last week, we asked the administration to have that answer to us so we can just let you move forward today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2791.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, we don't know where that where that dropped and we're going to as a council, we'll look into that because these are the issues we have, we've been fighting with this council to have legal representation at every single night for issues like this because this puts us in a bad way Mr. Bosley, and it's not you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2806.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So and I apologize for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2809.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will tell you I understand you want to work but I also don't want to approve something then come down the line that we have to then hold your permit and someone comes in from another department the city and say hey wait a second, you can't proceed, and then that affects your business in a way negative in a manner that will hurt you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2825.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: more than you think you're being hurt right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2827.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I apologize if you think you're being singled out or attacked in any way, but this is just a policy procedure that we have to correct that someone made a mistake on, not you, not you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2839.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's somebody that should have answered this question and you should have been gone an hour ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2844.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, we're gonna we're gonna take care of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2846.949s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will tell you, you don't need to be in next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2848.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2849.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council Council night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2850.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You don't have to be in next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3403.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any further discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3409.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3414.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like I said, I worked the storm in Somerville, and I think that I'm one of the first people people talk to when their cars are being towed and ticketed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3424.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So as an administrator there, that's one of my duties while the administrators are on the road working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3431.099s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the signage you're talking about really is put in place after the storms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3436.761s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when they're going to remove the snow mounds up and down the street, the snow emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3442.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Some of them luckily has the blinking lights at all the all the the storm alerts that are all the blinking lights, all the street lights that are blinking white light that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3453.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That calls for snow emergency for people to look at what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3457.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They do a reverse 911.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3460.613s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They do a, an email blast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3463.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then the last thing they do before they get told is actually the police officers actually traverse the streets with the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3470.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with the tow trucks saying, please move your cars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3473.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's under snow emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3474.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, but I think having the signs out there, if there's a way to keep it, I think that poses a couple of different concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3483.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One that we're going to have DPW workers that are going to possibly working, if it's a big storm like that, that are going to be possibly working 24 to 36 hours and having them go out hours early to put up signs or hours after to put up signs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3496.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that it really takes away from what we really need them to be doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3500.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that, you know, maybe working with the communications department to find a way to reach those citizens that reach out to you, that are not getting the notifications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3516.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But, you know, I think the signs might, I don't think they'll work in our community for that fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3523.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just don't think we have the manpower to actually<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3528.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: put those signs out and then if you're talking big snow, they're probably covered within an hour anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3535.079s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just think that there is a way that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3541.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: doing reverse 911 letting everybody know that there's a snow emergency, and what the policy is and which side to park on posting it on on public access television on the loop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3553.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then, you know, sending out city wide emails that that people that aren't on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3560.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think a lot of people that don't get notifications, it's just because they haven't been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3565.264s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They haven't been put on the list with communications and we've had thousands of people asked me, and all they really need to do is contact communications department and have their names and phone numbers added to that list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3576.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that if there is a snow emergency, they'll get taxpayer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3581.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, one of the biggest things I have, being that I work in Somerville, I get the same notifications that residents get in Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3588.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'll get an email, I'll get a robo call, and I'll get a text message, you know, throughout the day before a snow emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3596.518s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Once a snow emergency is gonna be declared, letting me know, and I live in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3601.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't think this is a difficult ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3603.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just think that it should be, you know, maybe a little coordinated with the communications director moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3609.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, a little winded,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3611.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3612.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for bringing it forward, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3701.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but maybe looking at the portable digital sign posted in strategic areas that don't really get the information they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3709.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think the sign itself, I just don't see that working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3715.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so I agree with you, every which way we can to help to get the word out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=91.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=92.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If the petition is here, you can come to the rail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=99.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=101.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've reviewed the process, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=105.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I find everything in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=107.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you, your times of opening closing, do you know what they will be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=121.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, but then the hours of operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=125.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything stays the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=129.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And number of employees?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=130.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=131.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you're just seamless, just a quick turnover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=139.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, Mr. President, I see that Mr. Kumar has put everything in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=143.148s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's been approved by all the departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=144.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I move forward favorably.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=354.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just spent in 20 to zero three seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=595.78s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=661.236s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, Mr. President, I agree with constant I that's my.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=667.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This didn't come in for the license of petition so I was a little confused with this also, not to say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=676.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, the petitioner, Mr. Bazzi that I'm against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=680.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that, like Council night said, I don't know if we should move forward with this until we get again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=686.353s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is where having legal representation here, um, you know, for the council would help move this along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=693.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now we're looking at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=695.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm going to recommend that we table this to next week, date certain till we get the answer from either the building commissioner or the city solicitor, making sure that we're voting on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=708.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: on something that we're apprised of, because like Councilor Knight says, I don't see a distinguished item that tells us why we need the special permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=721.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would look to table for one week and just to get this answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=726.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This could be just a simple question, simple answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=728.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, to the petitioner, Mr. Abbasi, this isn't,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=735.02s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any affirmation of that, I don't wanna support this because if it's just straight what it is, I see it's in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=745.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I don't know what the underlying reason for it hasn't been defined yet to this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=752.429s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would recommend that we table this for one week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=774.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: City solicitor, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=849.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Motion to revert back to regular business by- So if we can, Mr. President, just let the petitioner know, I know that before we rush off, I know he's still on, just that we're just asking for the question to be answered, and then we'll bring this up again next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=863.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=864.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Abbasi, did you get that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=919.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=922.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a sad, it's a sad day with the passing of Brian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=927.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Brian is what Medford Mustang pride and heart is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=935.911s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He fought a courageous battle with cancer, and anybody who<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=941.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: who came across Brian in the middle of his darkest days, you would never know that he was battling this illness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=949.261s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He had a smile on his face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=951.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He always, first person to volunteer, donate whenever, especially when it came to kids, he was always there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=961.512s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I still remember it was maybe 94 degrees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=964.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We were having a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=968.51s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a wiffle ball tournament in the name of Jimmy Maturana who passed recently for raising money for his scholarship fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=976.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then after that, they were going to play the first baseball game at the new Jimmy Maturana Field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=984.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And Brian plays in the tournament.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=989.745s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's 97 degrees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=991.98s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He goes through the whole celebration and then he ducks out and comes back wearing about 40 pounds of umpire equipment because he's now going to umpire for the kids so they can play the baseball game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1005.671s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In the middle of all this, he's battling this horrible disease.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1011.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's exactly who Brian was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1014.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, when you talk to people tonight at his wake, when I talked to his family,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1021.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He is what makes Medford a great community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1027.77s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was there to help anybody who needed help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1033.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he always did it with a smile on his face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1037.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to his children, to his sisters, to his friends, we are going to miss his physical being<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1051.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in our community forever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1053.364s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you for one person, Brian's memory will never be forgotten because he left that impression on everybody that crossed his path.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1064.01s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So those who didn't know him, talk to me if you see me, we'll talk about a few stories and just a great man.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1076.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I think in the last couple of years, I've said this too often,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1081.907s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we're saying goodbye to another Mefford icon, someone who left a mark in this community and never asked for anything in return.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1091.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to his family, we send our condolences, our prayers, our memories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1098.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we could dedicate this meeting, Mr. Clerk, in his honor, I would love to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1103.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And thank you for allowing me to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1107.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1181.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Moment of silence, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1562.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1563.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1565.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, how's the constant to bring this forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1568.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, um, I've seen how terrible this affects immigrant communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1577.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I've had the privilege of working with a lot of great families and great individuals that, um, just even recently with the elimination of the Dream Act and, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1592.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: these young men and women that came to this country when they were infants, and find themselves now without a home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1602.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're not familiar with their parents' home country, and they're being told that they're not citizens of the country they were raised and grew up with and pay taxes in, and they find themselves left in limbo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1618.407s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Anything we can do to support that, I would champion that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1622.293s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate bringing this forward and I would move, second the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2143.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2144.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2145.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2146.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I echo the sentiments of my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2149.079s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we had three dedicated people in a very important office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2152.98s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that when you talk about our senior citizens, the most vulnerable members of our community, they were the ones that really needed this office more than anyone, because they are the ones that were being manipulated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2167.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And having this office in place really put<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2172.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: someone that they could reach out to at any time to make sure that they're protected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2177.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if I, if I'm not mistaken, I believe the Attorney General has<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2182.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: has acknowledged their office many times on the job well done because of their excellence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2190.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, it's gonna be sad losing them, but thanking them for everything they've done for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2198.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when you can do something, when you walk out the door, knowing that you left a positive mark, I think that you should keep your head high and really applaud what you've done for this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2211.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As one Councilor, I applaud them and thank them for everything they've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3061.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, Councilor Scott-Bell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3064.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3066.264s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had a nice discussion with Councilor Tsengin in support of this resolution, but I will also share some comments that were shared with me from residents that were a little concerned that the understanding of white supremacy<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3089.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in the inference that there are running rampant of white members of our community in white supremacy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3101.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it really paints a picture<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3106.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: negative tone of unity in that light.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3108.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I support totally support the celebrating a black history month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3115.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I support that the city is city government, the schools, we combat racism and teach black history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3122.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that in my conversations with different<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3124.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: different educators and as we talk moving this topic forward and not just being just talk like it was mentioned with some members of the community that I had discussions with and putting our money where our mouth is and asking the city to ask the school committee to look at bringing back civics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3147.575s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So everybody understands where we are and a quarter of that civics lesson<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3155.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Bing!<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3156.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the focal point to black history in Medford and black history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3159.824s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's something that I've mentioned in the past in moving steps forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3164.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's not just talk, it's not just rhetoric, but I know that I asked council's saying to see if we could find other wording when it came to white supremacy, because unfortunately in some people in this community that it doesn't unify, it's really dividing our community in the sense that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3186.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: people don't look at it the way that it's addressed, because they think that every white person is being dressed as a white supremacist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3196.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's not the message you're trying to send in our conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3200.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I like what Councilor Bears, Vice President Beas mentioned that the intent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3208.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: might be more defined so our residents can understand that this isn't something that you put through to divide or made it so that it's one person against another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3220.999s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a unified feeling that we want Medford to be exactly what we've been trying to work for, and that's a community of one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3229.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: again if we could in and changing that I would support it if not unfortunately I would just vote present on this because I do other pieces in this this resolution I support a thousand percent and I would I would also make it uh<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3244.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, asked to amend it and to reach out to the school committee and asked to bring back civics and adding a whole block in method black history because we have plenty of it here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3258.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that this is how we're going to start the change<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3263.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: at the younger level where people understand where the black history method was I mean that I've talked to one of my closest friends who is educated man of color and said that with the with he would love to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3280.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: given the opportunity to go to the post office when the concern was with the mural, with our slaves being in shackles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3289.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is what everybody sees when they go to the post office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3292.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he made it a point to me and said, George, you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3295.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We would love to see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3297.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Leave it there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3298.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let our kids see what this history was about and how devastating it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3305.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3308.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: using that type of philosophy, where you look at the Royal House and the slave wall, and we'll talk about so many benefits and so many educational points we can use in this community, that bringing that class back and use that as a jumping off point to really educate our community, I would support it a thousand percent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3596.142s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can just if the city clerk can read Councilor Bears's amendment over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3605.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate Councilor Tseng for entertaining that for the other residents that reached out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3663.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: be a quarter that teaches the methods black history and black history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3670.756s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think it's important that we see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3819.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3821.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you counseling bringing this forward and know that I did, I did have some alarming questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3828.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had a Asian American family reach out to me later earlier today and asked if if method is dealing with recently increase anti a crimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3840.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as they read the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3841.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I did call, try to reach out to the chiefs and are you familiar, has something happened that we don't know because I think it's important that if it is, we make that public and that's something that we have to reaffirm publicly, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3861.805s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3922.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And yes, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3923.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate bringing that clarity because I think that, again, this is an Asian family that I'm very close with and said, George, have you heard something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3931.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I was trying to get the answer to that, but reflecting back to last year's resolution, I appreciate that clarity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3938.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they're not alarmed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3941.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I support this a thousand percent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3943.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's very important that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3946.107s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, as we talked to this constituent, that's one of the things they talked about is the Asian community finds it very difficult sometimes to stand up and call someone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3958.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And a lot of times it's something that they've taken and we won't take that in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3961.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and that's what I shared with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3965.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3966.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, happy new year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4010.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, what Councilor Morell, Villes, and Knight don't see is the amazing jacket that Justin's wearing right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4776.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Motion to accept.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4863.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, if you can just give me a brief, which one is this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4869.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are you taking both?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4870.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 631 and 023 to take them off the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4879.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Six, but 631, I don't see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4917.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4917.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I voted no on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4918.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=173.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=174.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=175.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thanks for bringing this forward, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=178.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council President, this is, this is a family that again you have to celebrate because although they owned a successful business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=186.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They were always one of the first businesses get back to the youth of the community so often you go in there, and you'd see a new plaque.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=195.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: express those representing and sponsoring another youth team or activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=199.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I've had the pleasure to know a lot of this Salvato family, and I know that they've done so much for our community, and I would support and second Councilor Knight's motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=213.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=421.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: poll just to be clarification for for all the residents, you're actually talking about another poll that upright in our community in a city location, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=437.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=438.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are you familiar with any double poles that are still left through national grid in the city of Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=463.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've asked for years to eliminate all the double polls for the fact that one, it's a safety hazard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=474.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: poses problems for ADA accessibility, and aesthetically, it looks disgusting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=481.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is only gonna be to erect one pole, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=484.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's no other pole near that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=527.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, I can I can understand that but at the same time, with all the public utility companies that are doing work in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=536.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a lot of either your brother companies have erected these poles and walk away and then point to each other to say whose pole that belongs to to be taken down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=552.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's my biggest, one of my pet peeves right now is that I still think we still have poles<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=560.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: through National Grid that haven't been taken down, whether it was YAR doing or Verizon's doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=568.142s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I say this all due respect, Mr. Ortiz, I truly don't care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=573.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to see action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=574.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sometimes the only way to see action, if we talk to representatives like yourself, that you can go back to your supervisors and say, listen, Medford's really gonna hold back on allowing X, Y, and Z until we fix this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=588.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: these issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=588.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, like again, I'm sorry, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm shooting the messenger per se, but, um, I know this isn't probably all we are doing, but you have to understand where I'm coming from as a Councilor, the, the issues we have when they're at double pole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=607.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, uh, like I said, it's not in this, this, this location, but, um, I'd like to see how my polls by national grid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=616.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2235.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2236.911s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Caraviello, I understand, I appreciate where you're going with this, but at the same time, I didn't realize that this would be followed up with, this is what we're asking for with a lot of what ifs, and that's what I'm a little nervous about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2249.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it's going to the mayor's office, you know, I don't want to go the other way and say, well, let's share, let's send our stuff over to another community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2262.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I hope that doesn't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2276.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I also think, like you said, the work<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2279.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The workflow, he does a lot right now in the city of Medford for our veterans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2285.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think I wanna help the veterans in Winchester.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2288.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it's raised to work with a partnership with the city of Winchester while they're continuing to find solutions, I would support that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2299.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But to do this, I know that it's just a word, but regionalizing means that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2306.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, oh, hey, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2307.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, let's, let's have Maldon jump in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2312.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then, you know, Mr. Durham now, who's phenomenal in his job, is really picking up a heavy load.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2319.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And not to say that they don't need support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2321.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think the veterans in Medford are first and foremost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2323.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's my, that's my, my<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2327.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: my hesitation with this, but I appreciate bringing forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2330.456s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand where you're coming from and every intention that you have, Mr. Caraviello, is always support the veterans in both our community and across Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2339.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's not a slight to that at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2342.981s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just think that, you know, I'd rather, you know, I'd like to see it maybe word a little bit differently, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2362.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is there any way we can maybe bring to him just a quick meeting, a subcommittee meeting, or a committee of the whole?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2368.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to vote against it, but maybe to talk to Mike and ask him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2372.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to know what the numbers are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2373.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If the numbers are 300, we don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2375.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if the numbers are 10, I can't see why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2381.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can do that, I'd rather do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2383.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to vote against it, because I have questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2385.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For instance, if the mayor is in charge and we're taking in 10, what would we could petition Winchester to say they pick up 10% of Mike's salary, if that's a way to work this partnership with Winchester.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2396.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I'd appreciate if you did that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=90.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=92.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is Mr. Pierre here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=94.571s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hi, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=94.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Peer, if you can come to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=97.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for coming here this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=100.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have all of your documentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=102.695s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, we see everything is accounted for and in order and approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=109.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know before we vote in favor of moving this forward, if my colleagues have any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=135.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 9 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=135.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to 10, 9 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=137.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to 8 on Sundays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=138.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Monday through Saturday, 9 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=140.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to 10, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=141.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=142.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And 9 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=142.739s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to 8 on Sundays, Council Member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=145.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think my concern is- Everything's in order for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=194.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=195.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is Mr. Massoud here this evening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=222.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=223.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=224.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=225.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I see all the paperwork in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=229.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just the hours of operations, they're not changing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=235.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, but with the new Councilor Knight, it's 11 to 11, so everything's in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=242.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I find all the paperwork present and in favor of the petitioner, so I move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=347.407s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=349.888s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, can we,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=352.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=353.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 22-022 communication from the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=451.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=452.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we could, I have the same question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=455.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that if we can table this and call for a Committee of the Whole meeting before our meeting next week, a regular meeting, and ask the city solicitor and maybe the chief of staff, just to clarify, I think that this is important for the fact that what we asked for is a representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=475.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we, at the time when this all occurred, didn't look like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=480.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uneducated buffoons and dog chasing his tail when we had legal issues, not to battle against our own administration, but just to guide us on legal terms and legal movements as we had some concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=499.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, I don't wanna see this, if this could be rectified in a committee of the whole meeting where,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=510.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we can iron this out and make sure this is defined a little bit better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=515.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it does appease both parties and we could have someone that represents the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=519.779s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that would be amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=523.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just don't want it to fail this evening and then sit again for a few months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=527.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my motion would be to table for committee of the whole meeting next week with the chief of staff in the city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=555.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, well, I think it wouldn't be, I think it would just be a defining evening for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=559.92s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think this would take too long, but if we can add that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=675.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, it's disheartening for my fellow councilor, who's new to the process, who just shared some insight, those fears that we're leaving the city without legal representation for one week, when we wanna make sure, until you're sitting in this council,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=692.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and I'm shocked with my veteran Councilors that sat here and watched our dogs chase the tail and how embarrassing it was for us to sit here for two meetings because we didn't have representation and how hard we fought during the budget meeting to get a line item that represented what we asked for and then to come back and something disingenuine to say that we're asking for, we're getting money, but it can't be used for what we're asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=718.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's just giving the city more money<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=722.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the negative ramifications we've seen with the assistance from KP law and different city functions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=728.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's a little deciding to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=730.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand everybody has a vote and we've spoken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=734.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will not vote for it because I think we needed a week to get better understanding with the chief of staff and the legal representation from the city to guide us when we have questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=745.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so if that, it is what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=748.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2256.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2256.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2259.768s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that with the senior abatement program, it works so well for so many residents that need that support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2267.236s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that Councilor Caraviello works so closely with veteran services and realizing how many talented<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2276.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: veterans we have in this community and the ability for them to come out and use their expertise to maybe work with our kids at the vocational school or work with the recreation department, programming, or even here at City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2290.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So especially what we're seeing in today's society, I think it would be important that we give back to the people that gave us so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2299.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I would second the motion, Councilor Ioannoni.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2302.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for bringing that forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3094.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Real quick, thank you for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3096.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's important that what Councilor Collins mentioned that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3101.514s">[Scarpelli]</a>: people have to realize that this building is for everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3105.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And having the opportunity for this building to represent everybody and that it gives everybody an opportunity to come here and express how they feel or what they feel what's going on in the city, how they can, how we can make it better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3119.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, you know, this past holiday event where unfortunately,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3127.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was some unfortunate misrepresentations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3130.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that it's good to see that the city moving forward and openly discussing it and sharing it with the community and the plans and how we can correct this so it doesn't happen again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3142.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=340.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=96.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a baby crying in the background.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=882.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I thank Councilor Bears for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=884.453s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just think that, just to make it clear, I know that I did get a few phone calls in regards, and I appreciate this going to subcommittee, because I think it is something that's important that's being vetted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=894.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, the fear is that will we get enough business done in two meetings a month?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=905.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the biggest question is really,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=907.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The ability for again, which was said many times to the people's forum that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=913.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: gives people a chance every week to come to the podium that have to express a concern or an issue that comes before them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=920.045s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these are the, these are some of the topics we'll talk about during the subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=924.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that this is getting the ball rolling and making sure that we have deep dialogue to make sure that residents get involved and attend that subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=935.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when it's, when we,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=938.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: know, share your concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=939.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I've received a few phone calls and a few emails in regards to the fear of losing that venue where a resident has a place to speak on a weekly basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=956.221s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I've<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=960.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I look forward to the subcommittee meeting and welcome all the residents that emailed me and called that had concerns to come out and share your concerns and that, you know, I think are valid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=970.766s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I also understand, coach, Councilor Bears is, Vice President Beas is, you know, thought process to get that dialogue going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=978.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=980.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any discussion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1116.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hey, I can Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1120.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Also, like, if we can maybe entertain tabling this for committed a whole meeting where we can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1127.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: really get the input of residents and we can really vet this process as we go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1135.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that there are some of these subcommittees that, you know, I'd like to, as we just started, maybe, you know, bring in the school committee and ask their opinions, especially when, as a former member of the school committee, whenever you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1152.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: not that I felt this way, but some council, some committee members felt that when you did a combined subcommittee, a committee that it might overstep a bound and there might be some animosity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1168.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now that not saying that it is or isn't, but this is something that it'd be nice to sit with, you know, sit with the committee members and I get some input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1176.379s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I did get one city school committee member called me to remind me<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1181.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when we tried to do that years ago, which I didn't, I didn't see it being a problem, but it is, it is a change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1189.065s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that it's something that I like to see in, you know, in a process where we could just discuss this as just this being the topic of the conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1199.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, making a motion to- Yeah, if I could send this to, I mean, rules or the committee of the whole- Yeah, with this involves all councilors should go to the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1286.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, I completely understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1288.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I agree with, you know, with most of the subcommittee, the new subcommittee, you know, changes, but I think that really it's understanding each one with the vision of the President and what direction<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1302.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we're looking to go with when you're, you're talking and getting the input from, you know, our residents that that elected us to say, for instance, the school and racial balance, I think that's, you know, something that we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1318.268s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1318.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we want to change those two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1335.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what is the change going to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1339.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if we're allowing the president to do that, and it's presented in a way that might have some animosity toward another city body, I think that's the concern that before doing that is understanding what the president's definition<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1359.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: of each new title is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1360.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that would be my only... Well, common practice is the president usually asks the members what committees they'd like to be on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1549.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So Mr. President, if I can, I agree with Councilor Knight saying if it's standing committees, I'd support that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1557.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I said, I think the question that we had were, if we're allowing the president<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1561.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to make some change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1562.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that has to be a discussion before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1564.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the standing committees I would support, but as we're moving forward to change or to add different committees, I think it's something that I wasn't privy to Councilor Knight's first few years and Councilor Camuso's, but I know what we've done here has worked in the sense that it's been transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1587.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd say that Councilor, President,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1589.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was not transparent and what I'm saying is having that extra meeting to talk about the new committees, I think, if there are, that'd be important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1599.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Other than that, I agree with Councilor Knight that we can move forward with the standing committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1604.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I agree with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1605.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Chair, would you like to support that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1630.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think it goes both ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1631.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1632.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why there are there are seven votes and there's no animosity behind it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1637.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just move forward in a positive light.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1651.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Don't disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1652.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that Councilor Knight said they'd support all the standing committees, but I'd like to, any new committees is just to have a committee of the whole meeting, just to discuss those few meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1664.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, Councilor Morell's a voted president, and I think it's just having that layer of discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1672.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So other than that, move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1715.999s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With the new committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1722.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that would be my motion, that the committee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1726.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We think it should be passed and we would have a committee of the whole discuss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1731.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: On the new committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1732.437s">[Scarpelli]</a>: On the new committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1733.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2467.575s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2469.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for, my fellow Councilors, bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2471.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think Councilor Knight remembered this very vividly because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2478.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm like my, my, my first year colleagues, which I don't know the background yet but I'm fortunate to work in a municipality that that people don't might not understand is that the sick bank is so important for brothers and sisters that you work with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2497.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that fallen ill for some serious health issues and employees that have occurred sick days that can give back to those that are in need for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2510.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think it's so important and something that simple, you think that the Family Leave Act is just automatic in different municipalities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2521.148s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so it's enlightening to a few members in the community thinking that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2525.297s">[Scarpelli]</a>: don't we already have this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2526.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's something that, you know, I appreciate my council's bringing this forward and something I will support and I look forward to the community to hold me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2533.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2746.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2749.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now we see this is just a business that is a pizza restaurant, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2757.407s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is the petitioner online?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2776.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, I know my colleagues have some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2778.739s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see all the paperwork is present in order for approval, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3100.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate, thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3102.698s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate Councilor and I bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3104.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that it makes some valid points, but I think that talking to a few department heads, they've been accustomed to using that Wednesday evening that they are here when it might be a little bit slower.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3115.695s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to really do the business that we we pass on on a Tuesday night for them to to to really get ahead of the game where Fridays they have a half a day they lose a half a day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3127.186s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it kind of hinders that process so I appreciate that and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3132.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know I I think that you know it's something that be interesting to see as we share our thoughts and community that being on that point Mister president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3450.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think those people who know Miss Callahan realize how important it was to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3454.526s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was a deep loss when he, when, when he left us, and, but his memory lives on in, in Council night and I applaud that he does this every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3466.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because you don't know where you go until you know where you came from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3471.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And definitely Mike Callahan is a person who<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3476.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: led the way here in Medford and supported us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3478.459s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I second Councilor Knight's motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4085.456s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4086.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilman, I thank you for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4088.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that you make some valid points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4090.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think even, I think the most important point is we have a new committee, a new council here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4095.221s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4097.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll see that, especially when I first started, having that chart and understanding who to call saved a lot of work for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4109.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something simple as, I'll give you an example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4111.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I got a phone call today from a senior citizen who lives in South Medford, whose son is moving into his home to assist him so he doesn't have to move to assisted living.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4123.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: great gentleman lived has lived here for over 70 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4127.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And question was very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4129.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now with the changes with the traffic and parking, who is who can he call to, to find to ask for another permit, temporary permit while his son is living there with him without getting towed or ticketed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4144.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it would be as we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4148.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That being a new department, having that that outline would be so helpful for us to do our job, and more importantly, to help the city administration, assist them and and answering questions I know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4166.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We created a whole new department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4168.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it was a few years ago with the former mayor that I believe when Mayor Burke came on her biggest problems were the communications, because of the pool and pond permitting system, and really have anything in place to answer the simplest questions, where can I get a, a pond pass and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4191.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that having that organizational system in place really helped that eliminated that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4197.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if you remember, during those times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4202.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many issues in Medford but the biggest talk the biggest concern was, how can people get a permit for the pond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4210.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When all it needed was just a simple phone number and someone to answer that question so I think that's a, you know, every point that Council night brings forward when talking about fiscal responsibility is important but to the simplest form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4225.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: asset is really to help us and the our citizens navigate who they can call when there is a concern or an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4234.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I second the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4237.202s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4237.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5346.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5348.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll do respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5351.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have probably one of the wealthiest gentlemen who's asking $2,500 from the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5357.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5358.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's not asking for any money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5361.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You just said that he's asking the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5370.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can't, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5371.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just can't even think of doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5374.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When he, when he bought on listen I agree 1000%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5377.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think encore is, this is a disgrace, but I also think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5382.01s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a city's responsibility that if we feel that it's affecting our downtown area if this happens, and they're breaking the agreement that they had with our neighbors, then this is something the city should have our own attorney our own city solicitor at the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5395.963s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or as well as unfortunately law represents separate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5398.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I know, but we do have a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5400.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So before I vote on any money being handed off to anybody, there's gotta be some clarification that if the city solicitor can represent the city of Medford in these talks, making sure that the city of Medford is represented at this table, because it's definitely a disgrace what they're trying to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5419.821s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're trying to manipulate what the agreement was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5422.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's going to hurt like you said, I care about our community but it does hurt all these small, small theaters across Massachusetts, it's going to, it's going to destroy something very very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5434.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think instead of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5437.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: assisting with $2,500 have have the representative from the Chevalier go at them their way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5444.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think the city should really take an active approach and hire a either have the city solicitor or bring on legal team that's not KP law that's going to share<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5458.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: our concerns and move forward with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5461.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the more people that are attacking this organization and Encore, whether it's the private entity, whether it's the cities and towns that have the neighbor's agreement, that we should all focus on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5473.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't feel that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5475.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know all the respect I know you're saying I just I'd rather I'd rather if you ask for money that we asked the city to go out and get a representative that will be will work for the city at the table, I'll agree with that, giving the representative Chevalier $2,500 to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5494.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can't I can't support that we get $1 ticket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5498.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we're getting manipulated there too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5501.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5503.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I wouldn't be supporting the B paper, but if it's something that we're asking the city to file and work with and ask for funding from this council to approve, to move some sort of money to the budget so they can get legal representation other than KP law to fight, I'm behind that a thousand percent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5555.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Through the chair, we heard the mayor speak, and we're so excited that the focus is going to be focusing on Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5562.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now we're finding out that they're taking away the only piece that brings vibrant life to this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5567.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're not going to have a standalone representative<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5573.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that I think it waters down how we truly feel about this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5578.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe you agree or don't agree with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5579.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I agree that we should have legal representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5583.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My recommendation is that you take that off the table, Councilor, and we ask for the mayor to hire an attorney<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5591.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or a team that's going to fight for this, this issue as a standalone issue as a representative of the city and that did not a $2,500 and we're going to follow the coattails of the gentleman who's making millions off of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5607.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5626.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So being a partnership, I think it belittles it, to be honest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6636.429s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6636.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President, I think that to reiterate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6639.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's important that we as a council stand together and strong and asking the mayor to not come back with $2,500 next week, but to come back as a standalone battle against Encore and the gaming commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6654.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they know that there are two different entities coming out of this community going after what they're trying to do here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6661.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's that important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6662.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think the other piece looking down the line,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6667.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If this doesn't work in our favor, who's to say the person we're going into partnership with to battle this issue doesn't want to break a contract and then we find ourselves in a legal battle with that group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6680.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think working together would be a huge, huge disservice to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6685.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think, again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6688.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wasn't as articulate and obviously it's Councilor Council night, but it's imperative that we are a standalone entity as a city of Medford fighting for the agreement that was put together and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6701.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if I were the mayor, I would really love to have a conversation with with Mayor de Maria over and ever and ask him, is this the way we want to do business because I think that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6714.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They realize the impact the negative impact their paint these neighbor communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6718.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not the way partnership I want to work with the neighboring neighboring administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6722.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7615.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Knight and Councilor<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7618.917s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Carriel, bringing this forward, I know that another huge loss for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7622.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that losing my mommy, you realize the perspective you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7627.999s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And especially when you're an elected official, I think that you realize that your mom is your number one fan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7634.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that Mia Burke's mom was definitely her number one fan, and we send our condolences and best wishes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8838.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to that point, to that point,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8843.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and to my fellow councils that are new, I think that the frustrating point was when we were posed questions and we needed guidance, we sat here looking very, very bad because the city solicitor responded back to us and said, I cannot answer your questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8866.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because of conflict of interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8868.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's why the, the importance was that we had our own legal representation and it wasn't wasn't put forth at the time was like us against the mayor, it wasn't, it was to get guidance and how to proceed with an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8883.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We sat here I believe for two separate days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8886.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: over a meeting that we did nothing but look at each other because nobody could answer the question because our legal representation, which is our city solicitor, couldn't guide us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8896.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what was the frustrating point for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8899.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think I appreciate the mayor trying this, but this brings us to the same concern, which is it goes to the city solicitor, which is a conflict when we have concerns dealing with issues that are brought to us<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8911.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with, you know, with the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8912.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, that's a winded point of information, but I wanted to make sure that that was, that was my biggest concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8918.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's that we look like, we look like amateurs, and it looked really bad on us and this governing body in our community, that we didn't have that guidance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9892.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9896.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I just think that it's just the common denominator that we've been talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9904.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm going to stick to what I've been talking about with the proposal for the traffic and parking, not truly having a plan in place for moving forward with funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9915.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We, we did that, when we're looking at what we talked about in the last, the last time we're here about funding for different positions and we talked about not really going through the understanding where we're going with the ARPA money, and why we just spending without having a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9938.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I guess Council and I, I've been talking about the situation from the get go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9944.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, I understand that the, that the chief of staff has comparable salary structures from neighboring communities but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9959.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: just the biggest question that we had here that has still yet to be answered was that the chief people officer at the time that we looked at the salary was overseeing two big departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9971.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then one of those department was taken away, but yet we're now going up on that salary line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9978.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't know where we're going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9980.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is my confusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9982.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not, I haven't got an answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9983.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to common sense when we're talking about your own home and your finances and budgeting your own home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9990.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have to have answers to answer these basic questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9994.913s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you were hiring a painter to paint the wall and he was doing the carpentry work and you were paying X amount of dollars, perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10002.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But that carpenter now came in and said, all he's gonna do is paint, but we're still gonna ask you to paint, pay that person that same money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10010.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna question it, aren't we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10011.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think everybody here will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10013.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what I've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10014.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we still have yet to get a true understanding where, well, he's worth it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10019.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That doesn't help me answer the questions that constituents have put me here that said, Councilor Scarpelli, again, traffic and parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10031.168s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're talking about where this situation is going as we're moving forward traffic and parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10034.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not taking it over tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10036.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've approved vehicles, we've approved positions, people getting paid, car payments are gonna be made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10043.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know what the plan is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10044.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They could be sitting in the garage for six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10048.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know plans for the opera money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10050.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about who else is at the table, did we have other departments at that table like other communities have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10056.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we said, the person that's higher that person that's going to be in charge of setting the tone that's going to facilitate that that'll have the expertise to do that that's the step we wanted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10068.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a step that we have to go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10069.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have a plan in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10070.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just don't see a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10072.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All I keep seeing right now are piecemeals that keep coming back to a slowly small, not small, but numbers every week with additional 50,000, 250,000, and there is no plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10084.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I made a comment that the frustration comes in that I have yet to have a true conversation with anybody from the administration with a guidance of where we're going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10096.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll be totally honest as a city councilor, I feel belittled in the process because it's gonna get pushed through, it's gonna be moved forward, they're gonna find a way to get it through and nothing is gonna be discussed and we're still gonna be sitting here trying to answer questions to the people that put us in these seats without any answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10119.73s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's my frustration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10121.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm frustrated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10122.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Am I gonna vote for that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10123.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I'm gonna stick to what I've been doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10125.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not gonna vote for any money paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10126.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know if you realize this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10128.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not gonna vote for any money paper until somebody sits with me from the administration and shows me what steps were taken, which direction we're going to as a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10140.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This shouldn't be a secret.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11363.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: close to the 20 okay but we do have the federal funds manager hopefully coming on board so yes okay excellent i just wanted to be clear on that one i won't know thank you the point of information too with that because i believe that the conversation we had with this was to have a meeting with the other departments that weren't at the table this is where my confusion comes in that we tabled it for the purpose<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11388.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to go to committee of the whole meeting to bring all the departments that weren't at the table, because I believe what we talked about were the only people that were at the table, the health department and the, what is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11403.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Community development, the only two department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11406.509s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And where we said, I think it was council Mark said, that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11413.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is the fire department eligible for ARPA money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11416.313s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11416.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is the police eligible?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11417.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11418.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: DPW, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11420.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Seniors, senior center, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11422.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then how can we proceed with this until we sit at the table with everybody?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11426.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that was the concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11429.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I'm gonna bring it up again to my freshman colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11435.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Remember, you're approving a lot of money without a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11441.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, this is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11444.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something I will not support again, because until I get a better understanding of what we're doing in this community with all of our money, I'm not voting for anything to do with money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11458.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Make that known.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11503.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's my fear to my council president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=267.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=269.142s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=271.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you everyone to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=275.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: give us this opportunity this evening to honor a very special person in our community and a very special person to me as I started my plan as an elected official.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=289.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Paulette, you've always been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=293.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that person that sets us straight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=296.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's been some crazy times in the school committee where my Italian got up and Paula would sit me aside and say, George, you need to take a deep breath.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=304.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And she was always, you were always the most calm person in the room and someone we always admired and looked to for guidance when it came to your experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=314.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And for everything you've done,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=317.436s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for our children, the school system, and the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=320.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We appreciate everything you've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=321.999s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that Councilor Falco wants to say something, but we're gonna be presenting a plaque this evening from the Medford City Council to congratulate Paula Van De Koop on her 32 years of dedicated service to the children, the city of Medford, December, 2021.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=398.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can, Paula, can you come on up and accept this plaque on behalf of the city council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1756.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1758.868s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1760.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate everybody's hard work on presenting this but, again, I think Council marks brings out some valid points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1767.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the first point that I think that business area and has has expressed the beginning and that our community whole meetings is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1777.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is really a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1778.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm finding this bothersome that we talked about this with traffic and parking, that when we're talking about money and different departments and really not having a plan in place yet and still having a focus group, but that was passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1792.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as this comes through our process here, again, without having<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1806.233s">[Scarpelli]</a>: these positions, and with the shared vision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1810.719s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know how we can support until we know what this this ARPA money is going to encompass, because one of the things that was very clear last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1821.494s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that other department heads weren't involved in these discussions, not to say that these positions right now aren't important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1829.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I would tend to maybe agree with Councilor Bears with continuing some of these positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1836.041s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think right now, I think Councilor Marks brought it up last week, that this position, Amendment O,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1845.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That should have been presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1846.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that tonight would probably be the only position that I would even entertain for the fact that we really don't have a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1853.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this person for this position is the person to help us with that plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1858.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Other than that, I don't, until we bring everybody to the table and really share a vision, you know, I'm lucky that I work in a community that the city council works with the administration and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1872.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they share each other's visions to get the product to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1876.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm not seeing this here and I'm very disappointed, really disheartened actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1881.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is a lot of money that can do a lot of great things for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1885.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And right now, it seems like what we're getting now with traffic and parking now this paper is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1893.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're just gonna add things and spend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1896.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then when we come down to some important pieces that we all feel that are important, we're gonna be told what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1902.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, we spent all of our ARPA funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1905.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And without a plan, I can't support this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1908.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1908.949s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1909.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Bacow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2110.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2113.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2117.453s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we in the process of, I thought we were in the process of reviewing everybody's salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2124.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that something we were doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2127.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Isn't that I believe it was something that the mayor brought up that they were going to look at every position and look at each individual salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2135.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is this still happening or this wasn't part of that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2142.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2200.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Last question, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2202.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right now, how many of our units, are we whole now with every unit right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2208.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do we have any negotiations for contracts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2210.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A teacher's union, I believe is done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2212.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are the other unions, as we move forward through these money papers, is everything complete?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2219.613s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do we have any big outstanding raises coming up or negotiations still out there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2266.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the question I'm presenting is on behalf of a money paper that we're voting on about money that this city has to spend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2275.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So as we make our decisions, I think it's important that we know if there are outstanding negotiations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2281.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not, you could say yes or no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2284.261s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You could say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2285.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not asking for any money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2286.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not asking for anything that would interfere with any sort of negotiations, union negotiations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2293.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The question I have in front of you is very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2296.579s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is that are there any outstanding negotiations still with any major union in the city as you move forward to vote on a money paper?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2304.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe that has nothing to do with the violation of meeting law, because it's a money paper that's in front of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2310.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're voting on money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2345.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so that would have been my next question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2347.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if you answer the question, the simple question, because it seemed like it was avoidance, just so our chief of staff could understand what it looks like, at least to this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2392.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, Mr. President, this is not a position that's that's in place, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2397.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2947.705s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any further questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2949.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2950.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scott Belli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2951.663s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, looking at the positions I agree with Council marks wholeheartedly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2956.747s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe I said that my first statement that we're doing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2961.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're doing this piecemeal, and it's not fair, but at the same time, I'm also looking at the positions that are there that are upholding that these positions to the coven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2974.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: pandemic and looking to make sure that those positions are still moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2980.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So as of right now, again, just for clarification, because maybe I'm not that quick, but the data analysis person is in place, but ends in June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2996.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: CARES Act that ends in June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4692.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President, I, I think, as we get closer, I think that Councilmarks brings up a great point that we I think it's important that we let all of the people that will traverse that area, know that that's not going to be a little area because it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4707.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: know, especially as we get going, I think that maybe that when we get closer to this project to completion, that we work with the city and the state to make sure that there's signs posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4717.859s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And citizens all understand because that's pretty scary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4721.981s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand that's conservation land, but not having that area lit in many different levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4726.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know, I know Councilmember Mox brought up the big point of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4730.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the members of the community a little bit about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4733.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, we've gone to a lot of discussion with this, but now not having a lit area and we can understand being police the right way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4741.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we appreciate state and local authorities working together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4744.917s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that, um, making sure at the time we post, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4751.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: throughout that area as it gets dark so people can understand that it will not be lit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4758.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that if my daughter says, Dad, I'm going to go to one side or the other, and I'm going to be pretty scared as a parent that my daughter is going to make that trek during the evening when it's not lit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4773.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That could be a recipe for some pretty serious issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4778.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would hope that as we get closer and I bring this forward, that we all agree to at least that point that it's a public notice and we put out some signage so people understand what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4791.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4792.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4793.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any further questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5047.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Happy birthday Stella.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5054.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a face we miss around here and the godmother of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5059.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What a great tribute to acknowledge Stella's 90th birthday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5065.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have to thank her for her number one present to the city of Medford, the birth of her little young son, Steve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5073.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And little Stevie and what he's done for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5076.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you and happy and hopefully many more birthdays, Stella.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5081.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, I just see little Steve actually here in the audience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5090.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: State Representative Donato, can you walk him up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5092.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: State Representative Donato, can you walk him up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5093.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: State Representative Donato, can you walk him up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5094.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: State Representative Donato, can you walk him up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6160.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6163.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To my friend John Falco, it's a sad day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6167.539s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I won't lie to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6168.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I first want to thank his his family, his wife, Jackie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6174.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think anyone could say they had a better partner beside them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6180.507s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that Jackie has<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6184.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: showing that she supports you in every which way and allowing her to represent the city for so many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6191.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that you've done an amazing job with your boys, John, Joey, and Jack.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6197.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that it's a great, you show not only how, what kind of a leader you are, but also as a parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6209.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If only one day, you could dress down and make me feel okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6215.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I dress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6216.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You just couldn't do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6217.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I thought maybe today you'd show up with that fake tuxedo shirt and but you didn't do it john and I applaud you, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6226.048s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've gone through a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6227.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We started this together some time ago and we decided the reason why we wanted to do it is because we love Medford and we wanted to do what's best for Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6237.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you stepping up and challenging the mayor for the most important seat here in the city, I think gives you, shows a lot in who you are as a person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6250.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And a lot of phone calls, I mean,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6256.005s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think other than Dina and I talking, I think you probably in the top three phone calls that we shared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6264.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't see eye to eye in some things, but we always respected each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6268.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's what we see that we're lacking in society.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6275.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's okay to disagree, but always have that respect for each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6279.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that you've done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6281.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've been a great example of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6286.191s">[Scarpelli]</a>: called you my friend before we started this journey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6289.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And hopefully I call you a friend for a hundred more years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6292.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for everything you've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6295.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It will be sad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6296.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that a lot of times when I look across the room, I look at my two colleagues to look for, you know, support and something I said or something somebody said, and all you guys have to do is show me your eyes and especially with these wonderful masks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6313.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Your friendship and guidance is something that I'm going to miss as a Councilor, but I know we'll be together for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6321.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you've made your mother and father very proud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6324.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've made the Falco name very proud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6326.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, um, and thank you for everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7687.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7689.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First, again, I think we owe a great gratitude to Mike's wife, Lisa, his daughters, Gianna and Olivia, and son, Evan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7701.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that when we've talked, we've talked so proudly of your children, and it makes me a better father.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7710.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a person,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7713.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I got that phone call, when you called me and said Georgia decided to step down, whether you realize it or not, it got choked up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7720.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And because I think that what Michael Marx has taught us is to love Medford, be true to who you are and fight for the community members, whether you know them or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7736.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nobody talks about charter review and wanting to have precinct award representation, Michael Marx is a great example, why that might not help why that might not work, because Michael Marx worked as hard as he could for someone that lived in Wellington Glenwood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7753.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or someone who lived in Hillside or someone from West Medford and North Medford or South Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7758.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You worked hard for every single person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7761.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not only that, you were prepared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7763.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think I said this probably one of the most impressive evenings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7767.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I remember that night that you came out and talked about an issue and you were so thorough and so prepared that I don't know how we as a council couldn't support you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7778.258s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's what you've always done because you've believed in what you wanted to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7784.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I'll say it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7785.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that if society understood what happens in these chambers and we can all understand to agree to disagree and have the pride and respect for a person across from you that might not look at things the same way, but maybe understand it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7805.579s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I tell you a lot of times I didn't agree what you were saying, but I had to take a step back like my dad taught me with his Jesuit upbringing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7813.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To put yourself in that person's shoes and I realized a lot of time, boy, you don't wear to eat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7822.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And my feet hurt because I stood in your shoes so many times and realized, wow, that man is right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7828.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And most of the time is because you love Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7834.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm gonna, it's gonna be tough because one thing you realized is what a good man you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7839.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And a lot of people, you know, when you first got on that, all that Michael Mox, he's something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7845.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He just, he's just an angry man and he's just not a good man.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7849.821s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then you sit with the man, you realize what a great individual, what a great father, what a great husband, what a great friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7858.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I tell you, Mike, when I might have something down with my family, you were there, the phone call was there, had nothing to do with city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7867.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, whether it was a edible arrangement for my daughter when she was going through a tough time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7871.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I said today is Council Marks' last day, she says, I have basketball.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7877.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can I watch it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7878.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said, you can watch it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7879.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But she really wanted to be here because you make impacts on people's lives that you don't even know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7884.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will tell you, I know that what you've given this city, I don't know if people really truly appreciate it until you're gone, but you have made a fighter out of every single one of us and taught us how to do it the right way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7903.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my friend, thank you for all your years of service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7907.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You set a path that people should follow, that passion should be in our hearts, no matter if you're here a year or 44 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7915.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I will carry that on with me until my last day in the seat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7920.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you'll always be my friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7922.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's what's more important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7924.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7925.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7926.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7928.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=363.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It looks like it's a changeover from what was the expresso pizza on Boston Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=371.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it looks like our petitioner is Peony's Pizza, a very well-known and reputable<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=381.69s">[Scarpelli]</a>: business in neighbor communities, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=384.311s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And everything I see here, Mr. President, is in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=389.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The reputation of this company is a very positive one, and I move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3274.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can hear your passion, and I'm excited about that passion, but I tend to disagree with my colleague, which I seldom do, to the fact that we're in a position where, I'm in agreement with Council Marks, that Mrs. Zarian said it herself, that we don't even have the community input yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3293.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So having a plan in place and having vehicles and a software system in place, and spending that money right now, and possibly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3301.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: possibly setting you up to feel that when we unveil this, it won't be till another five or six months, and we've just purchased something, leased something, or purchased something for five or six months that we're not using.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3314.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we still have to pay for that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3316.719s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still have to pay for those materials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3319.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that, like Council Member Marx says, I tend to agree with him in the sense that why not wait<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3331.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: put a plan in place where maybe we're talking to our traffic department and having them assist until we can unveil a true process so we're not running our heads into the wall like we've talked about in the past and what we see coming in the future because what we're going to see is, you know, it's, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3351.274s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the lack of cooperation from Republic parking, that's a hindrance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3355.096s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's hurting us right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3356.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have community participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3358.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We truly haven't seen a plan that we could roll out that spells what we want to do, because ultimately when it comes down to it, I know you're going to hear it, Faye, but we're going to hear it too when it comes to the community members saying, wait a second, just like my dad, when he went to go find a kiosk,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3373.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that's 70 something years old, and he walked around the neighborhood and couldn't find a kiosk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3378.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So something simple as that, just to give people the expectations of what's coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3384.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I reiterate, I agree with you, Mrs. Ayer, and tomorrow night's an important meeting, but I'm gonna be honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3390.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we really wanna do this right, we're gonna need more than one meeting with the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3394.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So until we know all these factors that we can put all this in, and this is why I disagree with my colleagues to the point I write that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3402.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know where this is going yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3404.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At least I don't feel comfortable with it because we haven't even sat down with the Republic yet to understand what the money figures look like, what we're really looking at down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3415.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Believe me, I'm all in with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3417.766s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's gonna be a great process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3419.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've got a great leader in place, but at the same time, rushing it to make it happen by January 6th is an unrealistic and unachievable goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3429.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can I say something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3431.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: By the time we order a desk from Faye, it's not gonna be till February.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3436.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's something that simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3438.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, I mean, we've said a lot of contradictory things to each other, but ultimately we want this to succeed, but we also want to make sure we have everything in place that we can present it the correct way so we can vote on it in a more thorough and educated format.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3455.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because as the steward of fiscal responsibility of our community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3461.005s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's great that we talked about a startup of $350,000, but we don't know if we're looking at another $2 million, a million dollars, we don't know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3470.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's no one's fault, but the system, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5638.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will work on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5640.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Faye's saying in the contract, there's only two cars in there, 14 and 16.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5644.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If they're driving new cars, they can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5646.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, well, I'm starting to drive around with other guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=6024.77s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=6037.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That clerk is essentially<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7688.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7691.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't see this being a long wait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7694.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I called for a meeting on maybe Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7697.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: just so we can sit down and discuss this a little more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7710.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then move forward with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7713.764s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's not something I want to hold it off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7715.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want us to make sure we have everything in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7852.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can you hear me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7853.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can you hear me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7897.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's so crooked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7899.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Smash a bank for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7911.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7912.716s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're so crooked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7915.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Go to jail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7951.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7952.73s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Would you like to wait for the other councilors, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7955.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The second meeting's going on, and would you like me to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=282.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=283.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President, bring this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=286.221s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Chief has been a rock here in the community for so many years and now I can publicly say my dream is to, when I grow up, is to be like Chief Gilberti, hoping to get hair plugs, lose some weight and go to the tanning beds and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=303.839s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we could say this publicly now, can we please get the new chief Friedman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=307.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know, I know, Chief Gilbert he had his, his, his city vehicle, which had the right the side to look really close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=320.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a fire chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=324.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I wanna get a nice big sign so everybody knows who our fire chief is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=328.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, but seriously, we appreciate all the hard work he's done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=333.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's not easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=334.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You can't make everybody happy 100% of the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=338.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think chief had that balance to make sure that his department worked for the best interests of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=350.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=351.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=352.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Chair recognizes Council Member Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=623.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Would you like to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=838.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=840.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=842.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, who have we invited?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=844.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I miss that, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=846.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For the Committee of the Whole meeting, we want, what departments are we asking, requesting again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=915.148s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, if we can't to go back to that I think that it's important I'm going to hop on this until we find some sort of resolution I think it's important that we have a clerk of the works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=925.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's really reporting back to the city when we talk about these, these huge, huge inconvenience<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=933.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: wrote the roadwork that's going on again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=936.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we have someone there on site every day something's going to get done something's going to be reported to the right people because there's definitely a disconnect, and I think that who's paying the price up and down Winthrop Street not the South Street and no council mark said it but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=950.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know this, it's no different than the rattling of the plates, you know, it's, I've talked to a few neighbors in Winchester, and I said geez I said do you have the same concerns with the rattle and plates, and they say no that was one of the first initiatives I talked to them about making sure that every time they drop those plates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=967.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was an enough of a buffer to make sure that didn't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=971.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But you travel and traverse right over the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=974.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it seems like the slap in the face keeps coming back with these huge companies like Eversource and National Grid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=981.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate the welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=986.364s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we need every department there that's possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=989.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we need to make sure that we have a watchdog moving forward that's representing the city to make sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=996.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything that that person will say from Eversource is held accountable, because if you remember the first meeting we had at Eversource, remember everyone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1005.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The gentleman came up and he had a plan, and this is great, they're gonna put door signs, and everybody, this is my cell phone number, people call me, remember how great that was?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1015.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have yet to hear from that, that man disappeared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1019.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was a figment of our imagination, because there has been no communication, no support from Eversource.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1024.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1025.868s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know we had no power control to allow them in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1029.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We heard that a thousand times, but we also heard that we would get the support and the people would have, somebody would hear a voice that when something needed to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1040.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm just so disappointed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1042.532s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll say this to the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1045.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what we hear every day, roads, sidewalks, and a lot has to do with our,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1054.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: our partnerships with Eversource and National Grid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1057.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm pretty disgusted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1059.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate Council President bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1061.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1062.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Chair recognizes Councilor Peco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2620.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2621.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2624.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm gonna go at this a few different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2626.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Tim, first of all, thank you for listening to us and giving us the answers as a department head the best you can, because we've been accused of being bullies in sense to other department heads, but I think people don't understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2644.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When this isn't a console Scarpelli issue of console Falco show council moral issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2650.297s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is an issue that we get from our constituents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2652.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think all of us got calls saying is this crazy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2655.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Look at Mr. Gav, what a mess, what are they doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2660.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not a reflection to how we feel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2662.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're the voices that people call to ask these questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2666.159s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So first, I wanna thank you just for doing the best you can to answer these questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2670.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know they're not ideal answers that we all wanna hear, because we all wanted to hear you say tonight, Tim, is okay, it's all gonna be repaved, everything's gonna be perfect, and we'll do it right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2680.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we know that's not the case, but we do have to figure this out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2684.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And maybe not Mr. Cabot as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2687.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I asked year after year of a clerk of work, someone that represents the city of Medford and what the city of Medford requires to their specifications for what this council is going to be asked on and answer these questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2702.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: not a consultant and I asked at the budget meetings, the chief of staff responded by saying, we would like to look into I think was a resolution put in place that we'd asked that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2712.821s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why can't we as we bring all these projects into Medford, ask for part of a fee to go to a clerk of the works that's hired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2723.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Through the city of method that knows our specs understands what we expect in this community, because I'm sure I'm sure that the engineer that they hired is a qualified engineer, but at that engineers there to collect a check from ever source.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2737.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that person is going to look at that and say hey it looks great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2740.539s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will tell you in the community I work in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2744.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If they know there's rain coming in on a Monday and a Tuesday, like they have, and they've got their trucks out there that night before, I'm gonna tell you straight out, I know these people, they're gonna say, absolutely not, because I'm not sitting there at a city council meeting the next week, like we are today, dealing with this, because now we're talking about ifs and what ifs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2765.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's the problem now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2767.922s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and again, this isn't about you, Tim, you're doing the best job you can, and I appreciate that, but I'd like to make an amendment to this, that we ask the city administration to look into, with the city solicitor, a proper form of funding that with all these projects that are coming in, that we have a clerk of the works that works for the DPW director,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2792.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that answers to the DBW director, not that the DPW director has to ask the engineer who has to ask the Eversource engineer that they paid for it to see what happened or what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2805.016s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I asked for a resolution was I asked for all the paving projects that was that were put out there for the last two years I got the report back which is great is all of the small<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2816.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: jobs that were put out there, the Tufts, the C.J.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2819.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Daugherty companies, you have the addresses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2821.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I really wanted to see is all of the national grids, the Eversources, and what I got back was national grid, no address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2832.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because when I drive to an area and a constituent has an issue with, oh, they cut this up, who is they?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2841.571s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they give me a time frame, so at least I can refer back as I drive by and say, oh, that looks like a job in front of 17 Butler Street, that that was a gas recut and they had to go back in because now that road is sinking, it's easy to go back and tell National Grid as we move forward, this is the work that you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2862.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, it's frustrating to the point that we sit up here and people in the city that don't know the process and what happens come up here and the braid us because, and I don't begrudge them for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2876.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what we're here for, but they braid us because the streets of this and the streets of that and the sidewalks of this and sidewalks of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2883.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And most of the time, there's nothing to do with this body or the city employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2889.827s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It has to do with the outside agencies that come into the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2893.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I implore that the city administration, there are definitely ways to do this, whether it's working directly with the DOT, Eversource, National Grid, these companies have big bucks, and we have to find a way that we can subsidize<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2914.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: their funding to make this happen, to bring in a clerk of the works that'll make sure they're doing what's best for the city of Medford, not for what the company that's giving them their paycheck by the end of the day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2924.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, Tim, again, this is no reflection on you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2928.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know this is a difficult position you're in and that's all we keep hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2934.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody here has been campaigning and all you keep hearing is infrastructure, streets, roads, sidewalks, curbs,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2942.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: catch basins, you hear it everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2945.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if we don't have the things in place as we move forward, this is only gonna get spiral even more out of control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2952.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is a huge issue, because I think you're right, Council President, we're gonna be sitting here, whether I'm on the other side of the rail, this side of the rail in six years, we're gonna be talking about how deplorable Mystic Ave looks again, and shame on you, because this came in front of this body back then, and we just threw it away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2969.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4365.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scapelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4366.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4367.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate Councilors bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4370.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we have many phone calls myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4375.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when you're not getting the information that's needed, because I think that's the biggest frustrating point now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4379.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the cat's out of the bag.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4381.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think everybody knows that they have the right and it's going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4384.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what the problem right now is not understanding when, how the quality of life is being uprooted and the damages that's going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4393.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I'm going to request<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4396.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we call for all of the people involved, a representative from that team and the city administration again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4406.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we go to that site because if we're not getting the answers, if the constituents aren't getting the answers they need when they're contacting different departments or asking for help, we have to take it to the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4419.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate, again, we've done it before, it worked out well, I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4425.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was, people weren't happy at times, but at least they got the answers questioned and they asked the question to the right people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4433.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because again, we're getting, I'm sure all of you are getting the same email from the same people who aren't getting the answers that they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4442.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, so I'd like to amend this if we can, to call for a meeting as soon as possible, because we're talking about 20 more days of blasting, that we bring all the parties involved,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4453.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to the neighborhood, you know, and we have a community meeting at the site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4458.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7457.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think God brings forward I actually am honored to have been on that original committee, and the hard work by grassroot organization with Bill Carr and Jay Sharma that started that program, and they were, they were, they were<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7480.651s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we tried our best to build in a system that part of that fees 10 years ago, 12 years ago would go to what we're talking about right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7490.717s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's obviously not happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7493.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wish it, I hope it did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7495.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe there is something in that account, but we put out to the state for one of our stadiums two, three years ago, and we are finally now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7510.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: resurfacing turf at Dillboy Stadium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7514.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is in that field is probably about a year away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7519.148s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one of the biggest things you'll hear the geo studies, a concussion test study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7524.51s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's going to be, you know, you might get to a point where you don't have any options once that test comes back and it fails.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7532.474s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you're not going to have any options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7533.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's going to be closed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7536.099s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that it's important that bringing this forward today, I think it's important that we move on this and it's not cheap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7544.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So maybe there's a way to look into the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7551.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the monies the federal government gave us to, if there's a way to, with infrastructure needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7556.78s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's gonna be daunting, but I appreciate you bringing this forward, and it's something that this administration has to work on yesterday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7565.364s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8067.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8073.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are one of the deaths that happen in a community that stop everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8080.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8082.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it's instantly felt across the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8085.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As he was called the unofficial mayor of Medford, I think, and he had the right to hold that because he had a great demeanor about him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8094.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think, I remember back as a young man in high school, first being introduced to Officer Butts, and he really tried to look at situations and really try to use common sense<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8111.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to come to an end result to help, especially kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8115.453s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he gave so much, that's one of the things you hear so much as you talk about him throughout the community, how much Billy Butts gave to kids and how much he gave to his community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8126.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it took the wind out of my sails because he was a pretty special person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8135.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And our family, St.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8136.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Francis, I know that my mom really loved him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8138.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Dad really loved him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8140.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He left that impact on anybody who came across him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8144.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know I've talked to a few of his brother and sister, police officers, and they were punching the gut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8151.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that really threw everybody for a loop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8154.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So condolences to his family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8158.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Know that Billy Butts leaves a legacy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8162.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: like no other and a legacy that people should be proud of if you've known him, if you didn't listen to a story, understand the person and try to emulate what he's done because he's a great role model and great example of a human being and a police officer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8182.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So rest in peace, my friend, he will definitely be missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=74.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=75.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First, personally, it's the first time I've been back here for a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=81.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want to publicly again thank my colleagues and the Medford community in supporting my family and my mother's battle and then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=91.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: just recently her death and I appreciate everybody for standing beside me and this brings me to this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=104.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Last week, I really didn't want to miss another meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=107.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I jumped on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=108.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was still with family and I was trying to do the city's work and as I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=115.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: went back and checked my notes, I realized that I listened to the question in reverse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=120.671s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I made a mistake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=123.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I contacted Clark Curtabese the next morning and asked for reconsideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=127.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know it was a lot of work, but my preference would be leaving it alone or looking at another section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=137.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So right now I'd like to reconsider and change my vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=166.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate it, but I knew what Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=169.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Gail said, and unfortunately, I just listened to the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=439.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=442.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As I reviewed all the paperwork, I know that everything seems in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=448.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that this is a Asian taste restaurant on Middlesex Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=457.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is this just a family run restaurant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=462.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=466.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we changing anything that we have right now in the footprint?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=483.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I see everything in order, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=485.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I request any additional comments from my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=618.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1705.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1706.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And thank you, Councilor Marksley, for bringing that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1708.796s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think these are the issues and concerns we have because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1712.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, today it's our friends from Brooks Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1716.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And last month is our friends from Fulton Heights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1720.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Another one, we'll get one from South Method.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1723.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're hearing you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1724.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what I'm gonna suggest today, something that we see that works, I think was Council Falco that brought this up in the Fulton Heights area, is that we call for a meeting with all the parties involved, city administration, traffic engineer, traffic department, police chief,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1742.544s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and really have a meeting at the site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1744.766s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think we did that and was it Fulton Fulton Spring Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1748.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And some of the things we talked about some of the traffic common measures, measures, weren't as extensive or expensive or time consuming like we're talking about because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1758.77s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It doesn't sound like it's, it's obviously what it is very unsafe, and especially for neighbors that that can't traverse their own front of the house I think it's it's a disgrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1769.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, I think that with this council's support that we call for a meeting relatively soon and whether it's getting bad but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1776.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We do it at the location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1778.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we talk about some of the traffic calming measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1781.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For instance, stop signs, making sure lines are painted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1785.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not the raised sidewalks, but if it's a long direct street that in other parts of the neighborhood, we see them in Lawrence Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1792.953s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the, not a speed bump, but do you recall the name?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1797.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The speed table?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1799.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's where it's raised, where there are lines painted on it, where people can see it as it's coming up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1804.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's not drastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1806.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh, bump, but it's, it's, it's risen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1808.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you have to slow down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1810.164s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So then we could talk about, you know, one way the do not enter what the process is for doing a one way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1817.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we can do because this council could present it all and what we'll do tonight, I'm sure we'll all send this out to the city administration and then we'll get a little piece of paper next Tuesday and it'll say, you know, from the mayor's office who they sent it to and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1833.661s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, once we get to that point, we're left with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1839.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a year later, a constituent coming back and saying, thank you for putting on, but we haven't seen anything yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1845.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that that needs to be followed up with a better format.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1849.98s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what I'm trying to say is, I'll make the motion tonight that we call for a meeting at the location with all of the parties that need to be there, whether it's city administration, chief of police, traffic engineer,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1865.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: DPW.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1866.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: DPW, of course, so we can get things, you know, we'll reach out to DPW direct tomorrow and we'll ask them to at least go to where the areas are where there are giant potholes where we have neighbors falling in 12 inches that they can patch those right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1882.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can't see why that's something that we can reach out quickly for, but- What did I mention?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1888.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1926.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the resolution, Mr. President, the resolution is to have the meeting and get all the parties involved so we can do an on-site visit so you're not running around talking to this body that unfortunately, I wish I made the call that said, let's go do that because there were 30 last year that we asked to fix too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1946.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: listen, it's not good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1948.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1949.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I believe me, I apologize, but this is getting frustrating for us too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1953.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's why I asked my colleagues to join me in voting to have an onsite with all the, all the department heads that need to be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1970.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2673.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2807.105s">[Scarpelli]</a>: be a two lane road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2808.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe it should be one direction or where it could start going into two directions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2814.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, we could, that's something that, that's why we want everybody there because I can feel your frustration that where is the meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2820.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do we go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2821.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we don't can't do it here, where do we go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2822.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're trying to do now is we're bringing the meeting to you and let's get all your neighbors out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2827.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's get everybody out and let's let's let them speak because unfortunately some people there's actions when there's a crowd around them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2834.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if that's what we have to do, that's what we have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2837.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And unfortunately, you know, my wife gets mad because I can't go apple picking again, but it's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2842.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hate apples.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2843.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2898.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's such a cozy neighborhood, it looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2901.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So everybody's all tight and cooped together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3828.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=59.183s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1479.532s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1481.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First of all, I know that mom had her<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1484.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: her funeral today and I just want to thank everybody that's on the council that supported my family and and and understand the reason why I'm not there this evening but I just I want to just make sure that as we're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1500.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something I presented a few weeks back that was being held off, and I appreciate to bring this forward this evening, but if we could just get a report from the city administration, the engineer's office, that we can look back at some of the projects that we've done that have been performed by, especially our utility companies, and if the projects were successful,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1527.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: brought back to what we request every time that the openings are at the same or better condition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1536.859s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can get just a simple list and what has been done so I can check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1544.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not just one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1545.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The problem is there's probably about 15 to 16 that people have contacted me on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1550.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can get that, that'd be greatly appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1571.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1573.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1595.822s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1598.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Thorde was a longtime Methodist resident who lost his life in battles with cancer, and a very important person in my life was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1615.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: one of the first people to volunteer and call and help my run in the school committee years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1622.855s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I graduated with a son, Scott, and a longtime Medford family, and I just wanna send sincere condolences and well wishes to the family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1635.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1799.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1800.507s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mister president again this is something that before weeks ago so I appreciate bringing forward again this evening but I was probably one of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1809.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Most phone calls I've been receiving this from my constituents about the rat problems we're having and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1817.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can understand the plan with the city moving forward with the health department, but I think we really need to move forward more aggressive, more detailed plan, and bringing in some professionals that really see this rodent infestation or rat infestation as being<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1838.353s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what they do best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1839.553s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that especially what's going on with the pandemic and what other issues our health department has, I don't think we're really putting enough time to really attack this problem before it even gets worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1852.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know just recently Channel 4 and 5 had Melrose's issues and we had so many different other neighboring communities that are going through the same situation, but I just don't want to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1866.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, get so far behind with this, this concern that we're going to be, we're going to be really in trouble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1873.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what I've asked is the city administration, the health department, um, is really work together and try to put together and invite, um, you know, uh, professionals, both the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1886.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the academia level and maybe contacting our neighbors and see what we can do as a collaboration, especially when we abut some of these cities that are having such a horrific time with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1900.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it is an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1902.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, I went to five different homes prior to my little hiatus and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1912.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The barrels have been eaten through, you see nests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1915.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that council's put forth some changes hoping to allow private entities to, public entities to enter private<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1927.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: private homes, so we're hoping we can do more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1930.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, really reach out to the city administrator and put together a working group that will attack this and its necessity as it's been called on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1945.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5646.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5806.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5807.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6515.584s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6516.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Falco?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6516.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6517.065s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Vice President Knight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6517.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6518.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Parks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6675.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6681.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7794.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7796.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=405.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, I'm fortunate enough to know the gentleman at the podium, it's someone that I idolized growing up across the street, probably hit the farthest half ball home runs I've ever seen in life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=415.78s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So some people looking, what is half ball?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=419.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is what, you know, we talked about the last year and how difficult the last, really the last year has been in really society.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=428.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that, you know, we talk about, you know, the division in our community and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=436.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At that time, if you remember back then, Medford's baseball was sort of what the city was about today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=443.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there wasn't anybody really bringing that together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=446.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=448.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Ronnie and your team really stood up and kind of put baseball back on the map in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=454.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I remember as a young man watching this happen and saying, wow, I would love to be part of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=459.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you could hear the kids that I would teach, they would be so proud to be in that tournament.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=463.698s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then to move it to the next level where you see where it really pays dividends and shows where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=473.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the kids that needed it the most found something and reaching out to challenge it and having families, the Alaskans and the Butler's for some that have been supporting it for years and doing great things in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=488.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's been a sad, it's been a sad couple of months here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=493.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, you're hearing these different, all these<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=496.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: different changes in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=499.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And for someone who grew up with these great changes, I'm excited to see what the next step will be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=504.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when you see the moving on of a Michael Mox or the end of an era and challenger and the MIT and see what you guys have done, I want you to realize there's a reason why people want to move to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=521.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's people like yourself, Ron, and your team that made Medford the city that everybody loves and wants to be part of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=528.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm proud of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=530.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm proud to be your friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=531.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I thank you for everything you've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=534.945s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I can't wait for Sunday's event and support you guys again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=540.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And those people that don't know the reason why I leave,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=544.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have a sweating problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=545.77s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't know what it is lately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=547.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's like 90 degrees and humid and we have our, and you know, I try to, I've been pawning my kids off now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=554.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hey, we're going to volunteer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=556.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then I try to hide behind a tree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=558.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but I just got to tell you, again, thank you for everything you do and we're definitely going to miss this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=780.855s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=783.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=784.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=785.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So make the motion that under special rules, we have a presentation from Councilor Falco to Eagle Scout.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=794.313s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, we need to vote on this one first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=852.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's a little slow today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=955.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Come on up, Desmond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=956.005s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=956.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=958.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, Desmond's making his way up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=961.209s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that it's important that I think everybody here really celebrates Desmond's achievements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=968.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, you know, first, I've been given the honor in the past to present an Eagle Scout, and I think that was one of my biggest honors, because you realize how amazing and how important and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=982.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What an honor this is the great people that have done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=985.076s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and I know Chris Murphy comes out every year, every time there's an Eagle Scout presented as a fellow Eagle Scout he's here to present so here to show his respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=994.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, with your family and in the whole team behind you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=998.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know the work that has to be done to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1000.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know Desmond understands the greatness that is upon you now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1006.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, president, vice president, something big is gonna happen, Desmond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1010.048s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just don't forget Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1011.609s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4214.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, and having a mass exodus with our board would be devastating, so I'd support this, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4405.051s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4406.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President, but maybe Mr. Chen can...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4409.917s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're asking for your name and address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4428.487s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so a couple of few questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4430.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that now this is just changing over from one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4435.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4436.191s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The other correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4437.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know the word when it comes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4439.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4440.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's just just the term that we use cleaning dying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4444.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4445.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4449.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The biggest, you know, in this area is what's happened in years of water so people may see dying, but just to be sure this is just a legal form a formality for cleaning and laundry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4467.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How many employees do you have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4468.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How many employees we have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4479.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, and your hours of operations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4484.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Six to 11, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4486.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to 11 p.m., sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4487.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4488.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so, I know the service is a lot of the college, Tufts University.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4493.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4493.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4494.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, I know that the business there was good,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4501.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: respectful and there were no issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4504.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that moving forward, we see everything in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4507.293s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't see anything holding this petition up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4510.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just wait for my colleagues if they have any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4548.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're up to regular order of business, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5019.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have information Councilor Scapelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5022.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry, I'm a little confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5025.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are you saying that there's a discrepancy that we're not, we're not, it's not, I'm confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5030.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're saying that there's an issue with the fire escape that has no reflection to citizens, but to the landlord, what does that have to do with, I'm confused with this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5067.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So Citizens Bank does not agree with number two, then?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5118.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, do you realize this is a hearing that will depend whether this council supports us or not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5127.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A city engineer is requesting that this be one of the stipulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5131.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You understand that, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5228.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm trying, I'm just, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5310.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, no problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5312.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, the city engineer isn't on the call, and as I'm reading this, our city engineer division recommends that existing encroachments be allowed to remain so situate for as long as they remain in good condition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5326.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If they fall into disrepair or poor condition, the city will revoke the license.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5329.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The existing encroachment includes a metal fire escape building and sign attached to the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5336.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you're saying that, um, so I just want to make sure we're clear on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5340.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you're saying that citizens bank does not agree with number two and will not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5353.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's existing, and for item number two, the engineer is giving us direction as a council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5361.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are steps that the engineer is giving us that you would abide by, so we would give you this permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5370.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We would allow this to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5371.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you understand what we're saying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5406.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I understand that correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5407.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, but I'm understanding that Mr. Salaam said that they do not support what that is because that is... He's saying that that's not part of his scope of work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5424.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm going to yield to my fellow consultants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5458.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is not Citizens Bank's concerns, it's the landlord's concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5463.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So obviously, so they're not taking responsibility for that, if that happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5467.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Am I confused with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5473.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What he's saying is- It's not a question, Ricky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5475.714s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This stuff is already there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5477.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know that, but if the petitioner just said, this is what I'm getting at, he said that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5484.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a disagreement with the landlord.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5486.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the landlord's responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5488.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, the landlord's not here for this permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5491.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Citizens Bank, if they're not gonna take responsibility for this, then they're not gonna support this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5495.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you understand what I'm saying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5509.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why would you bring up the landlord?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5512.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What would this council need that for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5536.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes How is that so difficult<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5542.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5846.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scott.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5848.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is such a big issue because I have also reached.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5851.459s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I did talk to a few residents that welcome the ramp because, uh, you know, handicapped accessible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5858.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's very important, but I think it's unfinished business between the petitioner and the city engineer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5865.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh I think it might behoove us that both parties that we table this so we get further clarification so this possibly could go to no vote which would then extend this longer than we should so I don't know if um if that might be the course I just put it out to my colleagues to to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5885.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: maybe contemplate that without the engineer being here with the assessor really not gauging, you know, the understanding of this as much as we should right now, because understandable factors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5900.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, you know, I don't, I see the sides on both sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5905.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a city sidewalk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5907.209s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's taking land that not everybody will now traverse because it's being,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5913.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh, handicap ramp, which I think it's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5915.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I want to move this forward, but I just want to make sure that, you know, there seems some discrepancies and some, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5923.963s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to be gone, but the negotiations shouldn't be done at this level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5928.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This should be done by the city engineer who are the professionals in this situation with our city administration, the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5934.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I truly think we should table this and until we get this information that Mr. Salam and his team sit together with the engineer and the city administration to clean up these fine issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5945.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this isn't in jeopardy of failing this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6221.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: know exists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6222.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6222.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what are we trying to do here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6239.518s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're setting precedent right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6241.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This council setting precedent something we don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6244.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: know that we've never done before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6246.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we need guidance and we don't have anyone right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6249.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have the engineer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6250.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our assessor has just told us that there's not enough time right now to get the information that she needs to help us with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6256.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I understand West Medford, but I also know that Salem Street encompasses a lot more of the sidewalk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6267.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it's a longer sidewalk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6560.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Mr. President, I know that I'd like to vote on the motion, so it is out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6565.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then I truly think, you know, we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6569.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like the gentleman said, I think we get everybody involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6572.01s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't want to go in circles, but we think we bring Tim.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6574.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have the city assessor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6576.115s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have city administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6577.917s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We bring in, you know, even the ADA compliance officer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6581.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that it's important that he's here right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6584.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, we get all these answers, these questions answered because it does, it is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6589.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that it's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6591.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, not the idea is very important, but I think the process has to be done the right way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6597.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this council doesn't set precedent for something that's leading us in a bad path moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6603.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I, you know, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6606.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6608.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6609.73s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6611.331s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Motion to table?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6621.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm going to I'm going to motion the table and, um, have the if we can ask promotion that we have the city engineer, the ADA officer and the city sister and the city administration work together to try to find, um, uh, common ground so we can, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6644.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: not chase the tail all day, so we can get this project moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6648.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's a delay, but I don't wanna go to a vote, the vote's no, and then we can't bring this up for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6654.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can do that, I vote to table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6658.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6668.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6669.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And while we're there, I personally,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6671.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, for my edification to get the understanding of point number two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6675.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's a little bit clearer in my eyes, you know, but my thing is moving past two, six and seven, we need that clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7121.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yep, exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7130.261s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, a quick question as far as<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8543.779s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scott Belli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8544.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8545.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council, for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8547.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that Mr. Fusco is someone that I personally would reach out to if we had issues or concerns, and he'd be the first person to call back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8556.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Always had a solution to assist you in not leaving people in the lurch or leaving them dumbfounded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8563.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that Councilor Marks, as his knowledge of what he does, is second to none, and I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8568.805s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He would have been a great chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8571.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But more than that, I think the respect<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8574.247s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what he gets from his colleagues and the people that work for him, I think is pretty<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8584.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: pretty impressive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8585.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that it's again, you celebrate and you applaud and you congratulate him on his retirement, but it's definitely, they're definitely gonna be shoes that need to be filled by a few people, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8598.945s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. Fusco, and again, a great Medford family, and I'm glad he settled in this area to raise his family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8610.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8611.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8611.768s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9481.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can amend that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9483.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9485.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for Councilor Caravielloo bringing that forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9487.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that, you know, with the updates now with the tennis courts and as you see what goes on at Duggar Park and how much of a vital pocket is the community there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9501.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I often thought why<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9503.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: those guardrails are even there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9505.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that there's gotta be something more pleasing to the eye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9509.351s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that there is the post and reel type of guardrail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9515.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it'd be interesting to see if we could ask the South State delegations to look at maybe converting that old rod iron, which is pretty dangerous on the other side, very dangerous on the other side, that we can look at more traditional, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9534.747s">[Scarpelli]</a>: fencing that's used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9536.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If there's any even needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9539.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that there's a need because I think there's no sidewalk, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9543.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think we need something there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9545.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that there are so many aesthetically pleasing, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9551.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: solutions we can use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9552.821s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that they have just the, it has the wood look that has the post and rail look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9558.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it looks so much classier, more inviting and allows the openings along as you walk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9565.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and provides the safety that's needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9567.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I know a few times with kids that are playing basketball and, you know, I know it's further away, but someone's taking a run at that and they run into that guardrail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9577.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm shocked we haven't, at least we haven't heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9580.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: any more serious incidents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9581.429s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if you allow me to amend that to ask the state delegates to look at replacing that altogether.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10037.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President, I know Council and I wanted to be a talk on his good friend Mike McDevitt, I think that Mike is a fixture, and his family's method method icons I think that Mike deserves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10052.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Congratulations, and a pat on the back because he uses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10059.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the post for so many outreach events for community events to bring our community together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10065.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he's a catalyst behind that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10067.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just want to thank him and congratulate him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10071.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I hope that my colleagues join me with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10076.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scott Felly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10077.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10177.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I think that once the word came out such an event, I think anytime that we have an opportunity to celebrate and stand hand in hand with our veterans, I think we as a community have to stand up and do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10194.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I thank Councilor Knight for bringing this initiative forward and giving me the opportunity to spread the word and making sure that we all<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10203.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: find our way to supporting our veterans that day and letting them know that the city of Medford truly, truly appreciates everything they've done for us and where we've come, where we are today and where we go tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10220.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think our veterans are a key part and a cornerstone of that vision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10227.353s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10584.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maggie Tootin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10618.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry, I jumped the gun table the records and then I have something to share on the motion by Councilor bears seconded by Councilor Scott play the table the records.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10630.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10631.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All those opposed motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10633.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President just want to share a date with everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10638.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Saturday morning, we'll be celebrating the, the life of Jimmy Madonna.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10646.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh, method, legend, and, uh, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10650.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: unbelievable young man who passed way too soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10654.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They'll be doing a huge fundraiser to support scholarships and other ventures for our kids here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10663.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It'll be a wiffle ball tournament.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10666.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's still some openings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10667.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the team is working very hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10670.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we'll have a I know Mr. Tanaka is working very hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10676.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to prepare the 50 70 field that's in the far corner of car park to be, um, be renamed after Jimmy Maturana.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10686.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're going to have, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10689.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Billy O'Keefe and Babe Ruth is going to do a two inning ceremonial baseball game with Method Babe Ruth players.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10697.437s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then just like I said, just a great community day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10700.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It starts at nine o'clock, and I believe the ceremony is looking to be at two o'clock for the dedication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10707.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's going to be a long day with a lot of fun and a lot of great stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10716.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for a great young man that's gone way too soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10719.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10721.045s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=268.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=270.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=270.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And thank you, Mr. South for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=272.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that with the teams is representing, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=277.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: these employees, I think it looks like it's an upgrade that's overdue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=283.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate your effort and your hard work with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=286.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the question I can, if we can make an amendment to just send this to the city administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=294.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I got word back that non-union employees, there were a handful of non-union employees that were bypassed their regular step rate during the COVID.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=307.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my question is, are we going to make that whole with their upgrade that they deserved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=315.209s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want them to, we approve a step, a new agreement, but they're still missing a big piece of their, what was owed to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=327.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we acquired funds from the federal government and hoping we could,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=335.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: ask that from the administration, Mr. Clark.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=338.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1634.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1639.065s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So could we leave this with the, if we move to approve, but also the caveat that maybe the city assessor could give us a cost estimate of what the amount of land that they're going to use and what the rate is square foot for rental.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1660.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, I'm just throwing ideas out there,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1664.368s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe we can ask them for some guidance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1684.621s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then I make the motion that we,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1688.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know if we have further questions, but we table this until the next meeting with the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1699.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the notes sent out to the city assessor to give us a recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2460.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2461.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council B.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2462.274s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for bringing this up, this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2464.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that Andy Milton not only<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2468.165s">[Scarpelli]</a>: was a great teacher and someone that we're going to miss because he's left such an impact on our school community, but also in the sports world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2476.372s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that Coach Milne was head coach at Arlington High School soccer and an avid athlete in his own right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2487.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that a lot of what he did in his personal life, he really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2491.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: he really was a driving force for a lot of his students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2494.695s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they talked to some of the students that they really took his drive in all aspects of life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2502.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's a sign of a great teacher and a sign of a great mentor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2505.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I guess we can blame him for council's BSV.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2509.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So he's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2513.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but uh he's a great someone say thank someone say thank great teacher and uh wish him wish him well in his retirement and um thank you i'm sure you guys had some great battles on the soccer field coach on the motion by councillor bears seconded by councillor scarpelli all those in favor all right opposed the ayes have it the motion passes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2633.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Chair recognizes Councilor Scafelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2634.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2635.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Falco, thank you for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2637.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, for years working in the municipality and also, you know, having, um, worked with Alicia, you realize how amazing she, she is and, uh, how lucky that community is to have her now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2651.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, I too want to thank her for all of her hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2654.661s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One thing about Alicia, we realized, uh, whenever you were confused about something, she brought it down to layman's terms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2660.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You understood it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2661.486s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, and she always had the answer, even if you didn't like the answer, she would tell you the answer straightforward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2667.209s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with no reservation, with no political bantering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2673.351s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was straightforward, highly professional and something I'm gonna miss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2678.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I wish her luck in her endeavors and thank you again for council Falco brings forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3084.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3086.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3087.353s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for Councilor<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3089.297s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Falco will bring this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3091.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was fortunate enough to watch Amy play as one of my daughter's teammates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3096.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as a freshman on the varsity, having a leader like Amy Orca to follow and to emulate is a huge, huge benefit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3107.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something that I cherish that my daughter had that opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3110.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: people what has been written last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3113.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Amy was probably one of the best players on the team and went up for a layup, came down and tore ACL.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3119.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if you know Amy Orcutt, I think she wanted to go back in the game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3124.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And but she sat on the bench, smiled on her face and just kept pushing her teammates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3130.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3133.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: West Point is such a such an honor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3136.574s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think she's going to make method proud as she already has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3140.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I want to congratulate her and wish her the best of luck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3143.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's a she's a great role model for all of our young female athletes, especially, but all the athletes in Medford High School to follow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3151.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3877.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, motion to take.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4013.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4014.963s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4017.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those are great words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4018.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I said it too often lately, but another legend lost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4025.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was fortunate to live three houses down from the mythical Ray Buckland.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4033.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you were a little kid and you came outside and there was this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4037.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe when I was a kid, he was 10 feet tall and he'd wear his Chuck Taylor's and he'd have a basketball in his hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4043.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you actually thought that he, he could never be stopped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4048.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when you approached him, he wasn't this big monster.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4053.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was just this greatest person that could be, that could reach, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4059.417s">[Scarpelli]</a>: reach any kid and it showed when he came back, when he came back from Europe and started coaching basketball for Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4069.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had a neighbor, I still remember, we had a neighbor that was a great young man, I won't say his name, and he was very tall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4077.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And back then to have, I think, size 16 shoes and to be six foot seven and be in middle school was unheard of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4087.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he was a little odd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4089.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And at the time, you know, growing up and I'll never forget that we would see him and I'd say, hey, where'd you get those awesome sneakers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4096.486s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he'd say, Ray brought them over to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4099.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's the type of guy he was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4102.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, he'd see something and he'd do his little piece, little part, little part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4108.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4110.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've spent a lot of time in Lynn and Frazier Field with our successful baseball programs, whether it be through Babe Ruth or whether it be through the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4120.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I still remember when John started playing, I still remember<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4126.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: some, that mythical figure walking down the parking lot and screaming out method Mustangs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4133.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, uh, there was Ray and leaning against the fence with the rest of the Mustangs and rooting on his method Mustangs team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4140.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, um, you know, I was fortunate to see him just to just a month ago and sit with them and watch a few winnings of the ball game with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4147.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But, uh, he was just a, like Adam said, uh, a great dad, great husband, a great friend loved his mom and dad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4157.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, it's another legend lost and send our condolences to his family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4163.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He will be missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4164.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5389.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The position for recreation is 53 to 64.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5391.362s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5405.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: remove the the facility recreation facilities coordinator, and keep the parking enforcement officer, Mr. Mr. President, if I can, I completely understand what counsel nights going with this but I think that looking at the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5421.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the description and talking to the director, I think that this person's role, not only opening the rink full time, full year, but also providing much needed programming with the middle school sites on site and having a dedicated person there to assist with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5444.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, sometimes you try to look at the benefits and something that you feel that, I don't know what Councilor Knight's feeling and the reason why, but I think that this is a beneficial position, something that I'll be supporting tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5689.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's a motion to keep the clerk and a motion to eliminate the facilities coordinator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6429.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scappelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6431.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you Mr. Oswald for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6432.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand what you're saying, but my confusion comes in as we debated the position, the diversity position, and debated the process of the CAF and how it went, is that you did do the work, and I appreciate the hard work that you've done, and you were compensated for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6450.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as we're moving forward to creating a new CAF, my hesitancy is that it was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6459.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the numbers were created for a position that held something in my eyes that if it was done correctly in the past and it presented to us, whereas the head of diversity, head of human resources to be paid at that level, I can see that's this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6478.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the reasoning for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6479.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as we're moving forward and changing the name of chief people officer, which is same as human resource officer, which now takes away the human diversity, you know, position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6490.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It really, to me, that's where the reason why I would want just more clarification, more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6497.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: understanding of the budget process and how that job will work with the committee of the whole meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6504.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why, I know that it's frustrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6506.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know you've done the work, but you also have to understand that this council is frustrated too in the process and how this was handled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6512.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, this is no reflection from me personally to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6516.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think I've said it a thousand times, you do an amazing job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6519.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just think the process and understanding the funding mechanism and how this is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6526.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was presented one way with the same number, and then it was changed with a bigger position that I thought was equally as important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6534.221s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then, but the numbers stayed the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6536.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is why I'm a little hesitant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6539.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's for my vote tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6541.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7937.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we had a question with stopping of a step raised for some non-union employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7946.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just wanna know if that's been made whole or is that still something they're waiting on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7951.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it was told to them that it was frozen because of the COVID or I just, you know, is that have been fixed and have been adjusted, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7972.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, no, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7974.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For 22, for 22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7974.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was 22, but I know that what, I got a few phone calls from a few non-union members that said that they were due a step raise back in December 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7988.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they were told that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7991.01s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because of the COVID, they would not be given that step raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7994.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And some of those were at the highest point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7997.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it made a big difference on their way of quality of life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=8001.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we could just look into that and see if we get some clarification on that, that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=251.584s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, Pat, uh, this is, uh, it's bittersweet because, uh, you know, you went through a tough time with all of us and, uh, it was your leadership that pulled us through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=262.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't think people realize how much you did do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=265.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, I know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=267.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when you're talking about a position where it takes you away from your family, you, you know, you, you see some people get bitter and angry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=274.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've never, ever saw that in you at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=277.183s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, I'd see you on a Tuesday after a marathon session, the school committee, and then thinking that we have a marathon session on Tuesday and thinking your week's done, but no, you have to do another committee meeting on a Wednesday and you're a one man team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=291.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=292.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No wonder why other communities came in and tried to scoop you up and why you're leaving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=297.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it hurts that you are leaving, but, you know, you took a lot of junk from a lot of ignorant people that you had to deal with and listen to that stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=308.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I just warned you, yeah, we had the flyby, it was supposed to start, and then the flyby.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=316.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So all I want to, let it be saying that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=319.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, congratulations for all your hard work here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=322.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's something that you set Medford on a great track.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=325.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The award you received, I think, is something we'll never forget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=330.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thanks to you, and have a great time in the neighboring community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=444.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=444.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good luck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=444.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good luck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1730.739s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1732.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: President Caraviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1733.821s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2363.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, Scott.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2364.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2364.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Markswell and members of the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2366.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had the privilege and honor of working with Teresa at the Osgoode School and then the McGlynn School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2373.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one thing you realize as a young teacher, you look for role models to follow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2380.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And Teresa was that role model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2383.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we focused as young teachers<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2386.868s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to make sure you look at the intangibles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2389.509s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we learned from Teresa is her passion for the children, every single one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2393.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So she was a true advocate for all of her kids and for our teachers that were at times going through contract negotiations and the nerves that are felt with non-tenured professionals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2412.274s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And she was a rock that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2415.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: kept a lot of young teachers together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2418.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And she was a great role model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2420.855s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So as a friend and a former colleague, I want to congratulate her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2425.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I actually thought she would never retire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2428.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And but it's, it's it's it's sad because I think she still has another 45 years in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2434.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate it and wish her luck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2437.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2488.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can keep going, but it's not televised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2493.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we still televised?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2511.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Quick call text back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2819.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2820.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, thank you, Councilor Marks for this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2823.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know another colleague that I work with, and you know the passion that Cheryl, my uncle had for her kids in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2834.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It spoke volumes, at least to me that, you know, especially when I first started on the school committee, you know, she wasn't afraid to call us<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2843.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and tell us exactly what her kids needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2845.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, uh, and she was a strong advocate for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2848.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, I wish her well on her retirement and congratulate her for all the commitment she had for our community and our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2855.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4264.981s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4265.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4265.261s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4265.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4265.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4265.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Motion to be brought back to regular business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4269.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4689.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Bears is correct that this would require a home repetition to be canceled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4695.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the estimate of $50,000 is the number that my predecessor<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4702.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: often quoted to me for the cost of a preliminary municipal election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4706.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a back of the envelope calculation, but it's one that my predecessor used and was very confident in using.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5104.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there would have to be some sort of, likely some sort of answer before then, because I would be ordering the ballots the next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5113.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If the drawing is Friday, I wouldn't be able to get the ballots ordered on Friday, but I would definitely order them early the following week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5120.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5121.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5122.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5123.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Through you to the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5126.223s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With that, again, remind everybody when the last day to accept nomination papers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5131.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the last day to accept it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5135.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: August 10th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5136.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 10th?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5137.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, there's a July.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5139.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were July deadlines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5140.69s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a July 23rd deadline for the last day to pull the papers and a July 23rd deadline for the last day to return the certificate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5145.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was the last day to pull, so 26th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5148.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 23rd is the last day to pull, 27th is the last day to return the certified papers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5151.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so again, I think that I appreciate that, and I appreciate Councilor Bears bringing that forward, because that's one thing I looked at when we first started running.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5160.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You look at primary, the savings is the number one thing, but I think that it's important that we still don't know what tomorrow brings, and I think it's a little too early, I think, because like Councilor Mark said, you had another candidate for the mayor's race,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5177.148s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and you don't run a primary, that can play a huge factor in what happens in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5183.01s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that, unfortunately, I think timing is one of the biggest issues, and I feel the same as my fellow colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5191.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate listening to you, talking about it, because it is a conversation that I think a lot of people in the community ask, because as Council Member Mark said the last time, it was really 50-50, not only with the candidates, but also with the constituents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5203.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can't tell you how many times, if you don't have a primary,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5206.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we save a teacher and it sounds great in essence, but you know, with the process, I think that the due process that we have in place is there for a reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5213.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that it's something that with the time being so congested and so questionable to move forward with eliminating is a little shaky for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6148.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6149.805s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6150.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6186.928s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6187.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6188.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6188.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: President Caraviello?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6189.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7466.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I think it, and I appreciate the conundrum we're in, but like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7470.92s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like we said earlier, when we did ask KPLR a question, they specifically said they worked for the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7477.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we truly did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7479.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think from that moment on, that's when we felt that we had no one else, especially when Kim, there was a question, like we said, during the cap question, when the city solicitor and I believe the finance director said that this isn't, they didn't think you could do that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7499.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the chief of staff said, well, he thinks they're wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7503.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we were left in limbo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7506.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, this brings up another question that we have in tonight's budget with the cap issue that's still left out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7514.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that still needs to be answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7515.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what we're seeing is an unbalanced process that's really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7529.575s">[Scarpelli]</a>: hurting the whole process, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7530.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I like, if that's possible, where we have legal representation from KP Law that that's spelled out, that we have a representative that we can reach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7541.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, you know, it's something simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7544.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, I try to reach Kim and she's very busy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7546.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't have anybody else to ask because when we first had the question of, oh, we want to go to executive session, it was easy for us to call Howard and the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7559.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and say, Howard, I won't bring this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7560.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How does the process work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7562.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I didn't have that luxury a few months ago when we had that same issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7570.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's something that simple because ultimately it makes us sort of look incompetent to our constituents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7578.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that that's the biggest concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7580.514s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we need to have that partnership that I don't feel we have right now, which is tough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7588.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8139.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, the question is going to be as we go forward, the jeopardy of voting positively and negatively for the for the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8150.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Different councils will look at different concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8152.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I look at this one as if<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8157.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: there is a process for the supplemental budget to look into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8161.716s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And without denying the budget, that's one of the avenues you're looking for Councilor Knight is that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8170.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So by asking for a reduction and then getting guidance from the finance director of a supplemental budget, doesn't in actuality jeopardize no vote or negative vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8183.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's-<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8328.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we only reduce it by 50 keeping 10<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8331.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: giving the mayor some time to see what we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8466.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is to reduce the amount of 55,000?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8473.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8492.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8503.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8506.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: President Caraviello?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9695.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll step out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9698.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I think that the mayor answered the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9701.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think what we're seeing is the chicken or the egg.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9704.907s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And um, if uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9710.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, I think you get to the question that there was a fundamental, uh, misunderstanding with the process with chief staff and the solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9721.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, so like I said, I think you answered my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9726.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10861.16s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10864.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10866.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One person that I can count on to be thorough is Councilor Knight, and I respect his input greatly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10876.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I think that Council Marks brings up a great point in where we are timeline-wise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10884.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that the commitment from the mayor right now<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10889.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and understanding where we need to go with the timeline and these, these oppositions we wanted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10897.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, um, and I understand what council nights, um, commitment to the fiscal responsibility, but, um, I'm, I'm willing to, uh, move past that as well as Councilor Marks saying, and, um, with the commitment from the mayor that we move forward with these and then come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10917.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10919.509s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There has been a fundamental issue here and it has been debated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10924.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have worked very hard on this, this council, I think on the whole budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10930.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We spent a lot of time on this and, you know, I just don't want, I wanna give the benefit of the doubt and move forward with making sure that, you know, as we move forward, we're cleaning up the mistakes and the errors that we see in the fundamental<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10949.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: disagreements and lack of communication that we see both on the last issue and as we move forward with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10954.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, uh, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10956.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, listen to my input, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10959.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11142.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council 9's motion is to reduce the city budget in the dollar amount equivalent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11146.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to that appropriated in the fiscal year budget in caps that don't exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11149.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the dollar figure associated with that is $617,390.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11152.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so we have a motion on the floor, Vice President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12310.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12311.981s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That same resident contacted me right before he came here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12316.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The question was that the health department instructed him that they're waiting on the council to allow them to go on the property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12325.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we need clarification from the solicitor, because I thought we were waiting for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12330.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The word we got is we're waiting for them to draft something that we would approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12336.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're waiting on the city solicitor, I believe, so we can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12745.507s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12746.187s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate all my colleagues adding so much input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12749.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that just a couple of quick questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12752.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam Mayor, the parking enforcement, is that an enterprise account?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12755.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Would that be under an enterprise account or it's going to be through the city budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12769.717s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12770.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, and I think that I don't want to be redundant, but, uh, first of all, uh, uh, Alicia, um, I can't thank you for your, uh, professionalism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12780.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we've had you up every single day and we leave this council and you go back and have to do all that work that we're, we're giving you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12790.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate you coming back and making sure that we're given the proper information so we can present a responsible, uh, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12799.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: content to the mayor and the city administration so we can make our city function the way we hope it would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12805.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you so much for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12808.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I will echo that every question I had, Madam Mayor, with the budget, I wasn't asking for, in essence, the city to find funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12822.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I gave creative<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12824.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh, input and in hoping we could get to some resolve as we move forward down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12829.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I, you know, you were on the council with us, you sat next to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12832.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one of the biggest things that I've been pushing for is the DPW, uh, adding three person sidewalk and, uh, hot top crew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12841.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I got the information back and I understand that that's not something that, uh, we're going to be looking into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12846.913s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know the process of adding five more people, which is, which is important, but we all know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12853.171s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, each department needs at least three more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12855.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I guess it's a start, but you know, I would really look, look at as the process moves on and really focusing on instead of budgeting or bonding out 250 or $500,000 a year, really look at the cost savings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12870.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we kept this in house and what those other three people can do, uh, with that DPW director and, uh, and movement and movement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12877.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, uh, the second thing I'm glad to, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12880.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I got a response back from the recreation department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12883.839s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One of the initiatives I brought forward was the reevaluating the process of scheduling and booking field times and looking to see where those monies can be filtered right back to the recreation department, to the parks department to assist in refurbishing some fields, changing fencing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12906.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's taking the money that we're generating and bringing it back to our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12910.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12911.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm, I'm glad to say I got, I got a, I received an email today that it looks like there's going to be some movement and there'll be, there'll be holding a meeting, uh, that they requested that, uh, that hopefully I can be part of and get, try to help that ball get moving that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12927.544s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think the biggest thing we talked about, we had a very trying year this year and, uh, one of the biggest things, and especially for myself, I think that, um, you know, I felt it and I listened and, um, was the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12940.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: social issues we had in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12942.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one of the things we talked about at the round table discussions was making sure we put our money where our mouth is and move forward with some initiatives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12950.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's why this council really stood strong and understand that really having the diversity directors stand alone, so that person can have the freedom to work with, you know, like I said, I'd love to see as we move forward with the school budget, bringing in an assistant on the school side and having those two people work together<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12970.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and start their own office with the administrative assistant and really getting to see what we wanna see for growth and diversity in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12982.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I know that it's not just on the police force, not just in the classroom, but it's also what our kids are talking about every day and what they're hearing every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12991.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And a lot of times you learn from our children and I have two at home and you have to listen to them, you listen to their friends,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13000.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think there's a disconnect in the schools where there really isn't a true identity that they can reach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13008.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have right now this position, I really appreciate this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13011.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a great, this is one of the reasons why I'm in favor of the budget because I think this was probably my number one wants in my non-negotiable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13023.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate you and the administration looking into that and making this come to fruition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13027.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So like I said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13030.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councils have asked some great questions and we've debated some great issues, but all of my questions were asked and I yield to my fellow colleagues as we proceed, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13650.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I too have, my sister works in the school department as a reading specialist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13656.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So just wanted to disclose that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13658.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13852.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13853.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13857.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Vice President Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13860.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Marks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13861.34s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13863.761s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13866.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13867.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13920.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For which one, Councilor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13938.766s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That one just got approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13940.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think you just voted to approve that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13962.739s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those are separate council records, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13966.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's council records from last week, and there's council records from last week's emergency meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13972.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So those aren't ready yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13984.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: are not on the agenda tonight, but the records from last Tuesday's council meeting and last Wednesday's emergency meeting, I emailed to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=14107.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they are not on the agenda tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=14109.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I approve Tuesday's meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=14111.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe it was Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=345.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=349.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=349.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Roll call, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=555.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, you know, I don't know how everybody else feels, but I think that with what we're hearing,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=564.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and what we received and aligned with budget concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=572.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One glaring is what Council Marcus brought up, that do we continue with the budget considering what jumps to the top of my list now<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=581.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is legal representation for the council, nothing against the city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=585.429s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I honor and respect her opinion, but the truth of the matter is she still works for, she doesn't work for this department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=593.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She doesn't work for the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=596.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, cause I'm, you know, I trust what she's saying, but I also I'm questioning the validity of the other reasons to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=611.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, personnel legal, you know, it just, it just, I, we're in a timeline with the budget, but I don't know if I'm, I, you know, I, I gotta think about whether I want to move forward with this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=628.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's what I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=629.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can't meet Saturday with the city solicitor, with all this information,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=636.756s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and without violating any open meeting laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=641.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this pushes the city business to a point where... Tuesday is the last regular meeting of the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=803.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, am I missing something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=805.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A point of information, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=806.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What is the posting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=807.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What was the posting that was sent out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=810.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For this meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=813.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What did we send out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=814.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can you read that back?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=816.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The reason for the purpose of the meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=851.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=858.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we were to retire an executive session to discuss the process of concerns of legal personnel matters without the topic, but just the guidance of what the process is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=884.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=886.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not, you know, obviously I'm not an attorney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=889.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm just, I'm not done yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=890.304s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm just trying to figure out again, if it's not about, if it's just about getting guidance of the legalities of how to proceed, not to discuss what the process is, what the situation is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=907.417s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Am I not making sense?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=908.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm just trying to figure out why we can't move forward with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=916.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That would have been one of my questions tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1488.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Legislative budget, or it wouldn't fall under the legal budget, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1497.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it wouldn't matter what we're doing next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2044.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2049.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I say we move forward to Friday's executive session at six o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2054.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would invite the proper parties and make sure all of our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2059.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: legal responsibilities are in place and we move forward and get some understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2067.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because from what I was told is that because this council did get something in that nature is something that we have to, we're obligated to follow through on our end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2080.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: whether the central administration feels that they see something that they want to have their own investigation, that's theirs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2088.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that that's our job as city councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2092.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have to answer to our constituents and that's why I'm, Steve, is your motion still on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2172.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: on working with the council for this issue to show up on Friday's meeting, is that acceptable?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2182.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that the question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2186.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm waiting for an answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2189.548s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know if anybody has an answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=212.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=212.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: While we're on the suspension, we take up paper 21-419.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=246.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=247.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=248.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=250.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see, review everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=252.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything looks in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=253.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we have a couple of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=255.913s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. De Oliveira, what are your business hours?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=267.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: employees will be working for you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=269.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=270.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Three?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=270.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you'll have a delivery service too?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=272.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=273.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=275.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we had one question that the establishment opened before this was approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=280.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we talked and- Yeah, I'm so sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=283.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was just a misunderstanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=285.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=285.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I did check with, it wasn't with the clerk's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=289.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I did go through Mr. de Oliveira's paperwork.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=291.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All of the departments are updated now and in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=297.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wait for any comments before moving approval from my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1608.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Scott belly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1610.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President, I think Council marks bring this forward and it speaks volumes way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1617.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody's talking about it so I all I can add is one thing I realized when I first joined the council and when I was coaching and we had issues and, and Mr. Cronin was involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1629.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He is the fireman's fireman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1633.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think I've, I've met a fireman that loves being a fireman more than, uh, deputy chief Cronin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1638.888s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, um, and you could see it with his, with his efforts, you know, uh, not just with the emergency situations, but just the way he carries himself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1649.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, he's a great role model for these new, new firefighters that are starting off and, um, he will be missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1657.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we wish him luck after 40 years of, uh, uh, works in dedication city Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1663.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and it is time to enjoy retirement and he definitely did his service for the resident city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1671.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1913.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor MUX.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1914.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Chair recognizes Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1916.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1916.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just thank you for my fellow Councilors bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1919.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We all know the Inessa family, and when you talk about a Medford family and keeping their business in the community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1929.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and thriving like it has and what they've given back to the community is a blessing and we share those celebrations with them and congratulate them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1939.34s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Two things though, I know that Councilor Knight's wife doesn't watch this, so it's impressive that he used such great compliments even though she's not watching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1946.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And last but not least, they still couldn't do anything with my hairdo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1949.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I've tried, if anybody knows a hair salon that can do anything with this, just let me know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1955.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2249.379s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2250.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council President Cavill for bringing this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2252.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I've talked to a few neighbors and they're appalled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2256.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that changing this ordinance might help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2258.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I know that we should look into, I know Council Member Marks has brought this up for years, looking at our private ways in general in our community and the lack of funding we're losing because they're not being charged to our roads and streets here for federal reimbursement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2274.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that it's important that maybe we call for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2279.814s">[Scarpelli]</a>: either a subcommittee, a committee of the whole soon to visit this ordinance in general, and look at the negatives of having that in place and trying to weigh the pros and cons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2292.045s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that that might be the beginning, but I think that this has to be something that we reach out to the director of DCR as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2301.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if we can't send him,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2305.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know who it is, they change them every month, but send out communications DCI director that enlightens them on what's going on in that area, because it's obviously it's being used for recreational purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2319.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if those, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2324.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: cars that are coming and families that are showing up and those parties that are throwing in our residential neighborhoods, if they're giving different outlets in different areas where they are approved to recreate and we can help them with that, that might be something we can move them along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2341.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think something has to be done because the neighborhood is failing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2346.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that some of the music and the noise and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2351.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: heard gunshots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2353.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One person told me, I mean, it sounds like it's like the okay corral down there and it's something that we really have to stand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2360.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that Councilor Caraviello has been the active de facto sheriff and going down there, but it shouldn't be a city councilor that's going down to support and help our neighbors in that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2373.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2374.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we have to really get our state delegates involved and other state agencies to get involved to make sure that we find some solutions to move these these groups out of there because it's really deteriorating that neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2386.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3245.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information, Councilor Scapelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3247.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate everybody's comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3250.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we had an issue on Equavia Road just recently during the pandemic where cars were parking from the fells and parking in the neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3263.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the temporary signs that were put out there with the horses made it reasonable for towing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3272.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and I think they just did it just for the weekends because that's when the traffic air really started, no different than what we're seeing in this area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3279.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I can't see why we asked the chief and the traffic engineer to put out temporary signs in these areas on Friday afternoons through Sunday, so this could be policed properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3293.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think we have to wait for a sign to be erected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3309.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, Mike, we need to demand this from the chief, the traffic engineer and the mayor's office that this is what's being done in other neighborhoods and it's worked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3318.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm a little confused with the, so I think that we make a motion that as part of the report that we asked for the temporary signs to be erected by DPW from the traffic department on Friday evenings and then taken down on Sundays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3336.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe that would allow<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3339.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the police, the leverage to toe because I know it's not, it's not the officers on the streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3345.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They want to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3346.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3346.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, they, it's not them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3347.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're getting it from higher up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3349.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we need to get really, uh, more clarity right now from the chief and get this taken care because, um, you know, until someone drowns out there and it's one of our firefighters that are going out there and one of our police officer going out there and jumping in the lake, trying to help a family that shouldn't have been out there and they lose their lives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3368.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's when<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3369.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we're going to see some movement, and that's not what we all want to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3373.364s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's, we need to move on that immediately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3376.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3378.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4341.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: my my comments earlier is for a motion that we call for a meeting uh to and bring in the stakeholders so um if we can you know one of the uh upcoming meetings i know we have finalized in the budget but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4357.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: having calling for a meeting with state delegates, a representative from the DCR, even somebody from the sheriff's office to answer these questions directly, as well as the traffic engineer and the police chief for the traffic department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4377.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because again, I appreciate that, that Councilor Caraviello went out to this meeting and when I was told it wasn't a big deal,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4386.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was just neighbors that were concerned and they were trying to bring it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4389.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think this has to be some answers and they have to be people sitting across the table to answer those questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4398.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if I can call that as a motion to call for an immediate meeting, not to say that we shouldn't try to do something this weekend, but what I'm saying is get some resolution quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4410.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and I know that Mr. Donnell brings up a good point, why penalize Medford residents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4416.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, when I'm gonna, from what I've heard, it's 99% of non-resident people that are just looking in that area because it is a beautiful area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4427.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you want it, spend millions of dollars and buy a huge colonial on the corner and they can have those rights, but I just wanna make sure that's on the record, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5525.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5526.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5529.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, it's been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5531.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's been bothersome to me as a first generation Italian American.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5537.107s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was fortunate enough to be raised by a wonderful Italian family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5540.969s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I was taught lessons by probably one of the greatest men in the world, my dad, who studied in the Jesuit seminary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5550.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he always told me as I started my journey as a school committee member and a Councilor, that no matter what the issue, put yourself on the other side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5561.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he was, you know, his saint was Padre Pio, and it meant a lot to our family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5568.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I hear the cries and I hear my neighbors that are upset.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5576.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the naming of the school, like my father would say, stepping aside, if it truly offended one person, it's something that we should look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5587.666s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if it really needed to be changed,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5590.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we should look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5592.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm disgusted in the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5594.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I thought the process wasn't something that we heard everyone, but why I decided to speak tonight is very important for the fact that I'm very proud of who I am as an Italian American.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5609.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wear that with a badge of honor and what I'm hearing from my neighbors, especially my older neighbors that made Medford such a great, great community with,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5620.681s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with many other unbelievable nationalities is that they feel like they that they're being talked down to and they they've been thrown away and the heritage isn't what they brought to this community is not important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5637.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what that's what bothers me, because I think if my mother and father, my grandparents felt that way, I'm doing a major disservice by sitting in the seat by not saying something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5646.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my comments aren't just to just talk about it and let you know where I stand, but one thing that my father taught me and the Italian culture taught me, especially in Medford, we always found a way to bring everybody together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5663.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think Medford's screaming that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5665.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to be honest with you, I think that most people on one side or the other, they feel the same way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5671.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They really do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5673.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the people on the other side, they're all not animals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5677.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Besides that, when you hear side to side, and the people on this side, you're not disgusting animals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5683.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's gotta be something this community can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5690.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My mother said to me, bring them all to a table, cook for them, let everybody sit at a table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5698.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: look across the table from each other and talk to each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5702.169s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you realize how many things you have in common.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5707.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've heard new Medford, old Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5711.353s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That statement should be gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5714.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5715.575s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We said this the other day when we lost Buddy Kelly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5718.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Buddy Kelly had a way as the athletic director to bring our community together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5722.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He made everybody feel like you were a Mustang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5725.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and you had one of the prerequisites of being a Mustang is that you had to have pride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5730.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think everybody that comes to this community, whether you are new or old, you have prides for this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5739.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think what we need to do as elected officials and we need to do with the mayor's office is try to find that common ground, find a way we can bring everybody together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5748.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It could be something as a community event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5751.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we bring everybody together and say, hey, let's sit down and let's just talk to each other and understand because some of my new neighbors I've talked to, they said, George, I'm just so disgusted with this group that doesn't understand that Columbus was a slave monger and it hurts people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5773.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And my discussions with those people and the understanding is that's really not the cry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5779.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The cry is that what Columbus meant to the Italian Americans at a very difficult time, they gave them, that symbol gave them an understanding of what America was and made them feel part of America when they didn't have a country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5798.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something very similar that a lot of people in this country are going through right now, whether you're Latino, whether you're Brazilian, whether you're Haitian Creole and you're moving to this country,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5809.756s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they want to be in our country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5811.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They love our country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5811.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what makes America great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5815.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I, you know, I know we're not supposed to comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5819.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not supposed to make motions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5820.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5821.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't anywhere that we can do that, but as we move forward, I think that maybe this council can be creative enough to work together, all seven of us, and look at all of our groups that we work with and try to find a way with the office across the hall and maybe find a community event that brings everybody to the center of our town<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5844.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and celebrate it with cultural music and cultural foods and, and, and open tables.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5849.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, we have round tables for everything, but I'm almost sure the people in this room haven't really sat down and talked to people on the other side of that social media blog that they're beating up because they, there's just no communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5865.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So someone told me my best quality when I first started as a, as a coach was I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5873.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I did a great job bringing people together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5876.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think I'm on account of a great group of people that want to bring people together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5880.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that as we move forward, when we can make motions and we can move forward, that we're creative enough to find something that'll help Medford heal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5888.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's so divided right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5892.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's not comfortable for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5895.364s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not comfortable for my children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5897.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't what, this is how I wasn't raised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5901.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we love Medford for a reason, just like the people that just came in on Carberry and just bought an $800,000 home because they want to be part of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5911.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They want to be part of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5913.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we have to find a way that we really work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5916.949s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, you can't belittle the opinions of Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5921.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: D'Antonio.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5922.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's how you feel and whether you like it or not, you still have to listen to those words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5928.362s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and vice versa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5930.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I thank you for bringing this topic forward just so I can let my feelings, you know, be told that I haven't really expressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5938.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, um, you know, when I sit back and talk to my dad, these are the stories he tells me is he would have told me is to find a way to bring everybody together and use our culture and our heritage to do what's been done for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5955.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5956.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7072.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7517.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7519.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, I'd like to make a motion that we, we, we, uh, convene a meeting, a committee of the whole meeting with our community preservation committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7527.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, um, really now that we've been working with, uh, these funding, these funds and, and looking at these different pools, be interesting to get a report to see what, what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7541.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: demographic, what groups are really not reaching that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7544.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we getting enough people in the housing field that are requesting enough funding?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7550.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we getting enough people for the funding for recreation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7554.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we always talk about the historical sites and this is perfect and it's where it needs to go, but at the same time, are we reaching enough people in our community that have the ability to apply for these funds?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7572.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And are we doing enough to promote that and communicate with the community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7578.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it really just, if we can, is just having a meeting with the committee and just getting a breakdown and just revisit everything and look at it as a whole again to see as we move forward to the next application process that maybe we should be focusing on one area, not the other, because of,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7602.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: making sure that there's equity with the funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7604.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can do that, that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7606.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=7607.544s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And thank you, Alicia and Danielle for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2636.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is something that needs a little more teeth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2644.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2645.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this needs a little more teeth than just an explanation from the management company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2652.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is where our state administration has to take a lead, whether it's with the Board of Health, the building code, the building department, or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2659.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: code enforcement or the city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2662.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'd like to make an amendment that I think that not only through, from what I heard is that there are certain a timeline when these certain buildings, and I think that all our assisted living buildings should have some sort of protection with the city administration, whether which department to be, but my amendment would be that they would look at not just the heat, but excessive cold, that there are certain timelines when they,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2689.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they look to turn these air conditioners or the heating systems on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2693.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as you can see in New England weather and what we're seeing in different, we'll have days of 35 degrees one day, another day we'll have 90 degrees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2702.474s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we have to have a way or we have to have an assistance here in the city of Medford where our city administration involved working with these assisted living homes where we're protecting our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2714.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that from what I gathered, it was probably the most terrific<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2719.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: situation where you're stuck on the fifth floor and there's no heat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2724.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, there's no air conditioning that it was oppressive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2726.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, which is dangerous for our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2729.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate Councilor Falco, Councilor Knight bringing this forward, but I think we need to make, I'd like to amend this at the city administration and city solicitor's office, whether it be the code enforcement officer or the health department, that we implement a regulation that when,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2749.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: cases of certain heat or cold, that we make sure that by code or by law, by ordinance, that we're taking steps to make sure we're protecting our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3427.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3429.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I heard this news Friday morning, it was probably one of the toughest days because Buddy Kelly's played such a positive impact in my life and thousands of other residents here in the city of Medford and outside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3444.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First to his family, his wife, Judy, who stood beside him through two bouts of cancer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3452.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and the most awful fifth stage of Parkinson's disease.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3456.719s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And his loving children, Beth, Judy, and Linda, who were there every step of the way for their dad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3465.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: From what I hear, the last few months spent every single evening with him, making sure mom had the assistance that buddy's independence required.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3478.747s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I say this, I say this too often, maybe it starts to sound a little corny,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3483.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is happening too often when legends are leaving us here in Metro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3487.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I thought of Buddy the other day and yesterday when we see our city going through a pretty tough time and it's so divided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3495.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And Buddy would be the type of person, no matter what race or gender, sexual orientation, what religion, your height, your color hair, or if you had no hair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3508.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's the type of person that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3511.165s">[Scarpelli]</a>: would find that bond to bring everybody together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3514.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what I think we miss here right now in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3518.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what I'm talking about is if you grew up in Medford and if you didn't grow up in Medford, you should learn about this because Buddy taught me some important lessons in life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3528.77s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I learned them in my home about loyalty and commitment and pride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3533.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's in your home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3534.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's instilled in you by your mom and dad and your family, you hope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3537.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But Buddy taught you outside the home<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3540.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is what it all meant to be in Medford Mustang and be, and as he would say, blue and white, blue and white.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3551.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And how that blue and white flow through your veins, no matter who you were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3554.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it was funny as I read posts and talked to alumni and, you know, Krista McCormick, a legendary basketball player, captain of UMaine when I played professionally, she called us and she sent the message and said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3569.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But he was so amazing that he was the person back in the day that said to the girls' basketball program, to the boys' basketball program, hold on a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3578.164s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The boys don't get the glass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3580.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The girls can shoot on that same glass the day before game day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3584.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So he changed the rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3587.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he made sure that everybody felt comfortable in Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3591.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He had his own way, but his way was the Mustang way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3595.719s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He brought everybody together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3599.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm going to miss him greatly because he did instill in me as a young coach and a young man what it was and why we live in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3608.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because truly, whether you're here a day or whether you're here for 35 years, you're here for a reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3615.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You moved here for a reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3616.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're brought here for a reason because you love the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3621.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if we can get back to what Buddy taught us for so many years and taught so many people that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3629.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: let the blue and white overcome everything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3633.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you could see amazing things happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3637.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like I said, last couple of nights, I've been thinking about buddy and seeing what our city is going through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3642.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that analogy just came to me because it really meant a lot to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3646.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the type of person that brought me into coaching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3649.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the type of person that when you sit in a locker room with my teams, that it wasn't about the win or the loss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3657.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was about being a Mustang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3658.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and loving the blue and white and loving the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3662.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And somewhere along the line, we forgot that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3665.494s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'd be remiss to say that if it wasn't for Buddy Kelly, I don't know if my life would ever be the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3671.437s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He taught me so much and I'm gonna miss him forever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=28.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2664.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4264.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4264.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I will not try to match what Councilor Marks has said, because I said this the other night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4272.526s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what a Councilor does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4275.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council Marks was ahead of this before anybody else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4278.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He did his homework.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4279.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was thorough, and when he went to the meeting the other night, I was on that meeting, and I think it would have done a major disservice if I jumped in with what he's already done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4290.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we're lucky to have him spearhead this effort because there are concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4296.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that Councilor Knight also has done his homework, and I wanna leave what he's done to be presented by his expertise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4306.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All I'm really focused on right now is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4310.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, the understanding that I support Councilor Marks and every syllable he mentioned this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4317.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that there is such confusion out there right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4320.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's coming from the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4323.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's coming from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4326.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: different department heads that who can do what, this is the city council's privy, this is the mayor's privy, so we'll clear that up, I believe, this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4335.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I do want to, if I can, there were department heads that were there the other night, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4341.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you know, unfortunately I can't tell, is Tim McGivern or Alicia Hunt on the call right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4355.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4356.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that as Dave Rodriguez, the chief of staff, is he eligible to speak?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4361.261s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I asked him a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4373.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4379.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council Marks already brought this up, but I wanted to make sure that we had someone on the call today that we can implore to them that the biggest call that one of the biggest bothersome issues that came about was something this council has worked hard to do, and that's making sure that everybody is represented, that everybody has a chance to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4399.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, we can go all the way back to the budget hearings last year that we had enough concerns that we didn't show up to a meeting because we wanted to make sure that there was a forum for everybody to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4410.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We worked hard, the council president worked hard with the administration to make sure we have people here that I will bet you a dollar for everyone that they wouldn't have had an opportunity to get on Zoom to express their concerns to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4424.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're in a safe manner, they're socially distancing, they're following through all the rules,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4429.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that brings me to the biggest question, the biggest issue I had with this, is that a department head mentioned that this, we've heard enough community participation and no one else can speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4449.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wanna make sure that the chief of staff and the department heads understand they're running this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4455.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody that'll be there on Thursday,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4458.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know listen, we've been there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4460.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've been the marathon meetings that lasted to one two o'clock in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4464.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is our job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4465.164s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is your job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4467.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is this affects everybody's just because it might not follow the telephone pole in front of your house doesn't mean that you can't listen to every concern of every citizen in our community because it matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4480.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because today it's in front of one person's home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4484.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But like we talked about, they're expecting another 40, 50 who knows how many more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4489.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this scares a lot of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4491.609s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are a lot of questions out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4493.231s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll tell you, it just tells you how great the city of Medford is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4496.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I heard some great dialogue from some brilliant people in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4502.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, the only people that were answering those questions were scientists, or managers, or people involved with Verizon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4510.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Either they work for the construction companies that'll be doing the installation, they weren't directly, one of the questions, do you work with Verizon?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4519.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the answer was, no, I work for this company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4523.142s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, that's the company that puts in the towers for Verizon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4526.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So technically, he's telling the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4529.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But these are the issues that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4532.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And why do we know that when communication can either help or hurt, with the lack of?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4539.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A few years back, a gentleman named Bill Carr Jr.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4543.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: started a committee to build new fields behind Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4547.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what he did was he went out and secured a cell phone tower of over a million dollars to pay for those fields.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4556.98s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he was given every single hurdle to jump over, every single route to run through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4562.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one of the biggest questions those neighbors had in the area, because everybody knows around the Medford High School area, there's absolutely zero cell space there, that no one can pick up a call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4575.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's one of the number one cell areas in the country, we were told.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4581.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we did is we brought in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4583.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Educators and scientists from MIT and Tufts that we didn't pay, they came in on their own, brought in by the community members because they worked at MIT or worked at Tufts, and they brought these professionals in that really helped all the neighbors understand what the scenarios were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4604.264s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that, to be honest with you, it calmed a lot of people down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4608.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're seeing right now, what I'm hearing now with hundreds of emails and phone calls is the lack of representation of an independent person, an independent scientist that are gonna give us a little more insight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4622.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Instead, we heard some great dialogue from people that have done their homework.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4625.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know one gentleman, he had the study from Europe that they don't allow this at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4629.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not even a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4632.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, the Board of Health was a member of that committee who voted no, that should speak volumes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4638.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I implore the city administrators that will be running this meeting, whatever department it is, whether it's Alicia Hunt, whether it's Tim McGivern, that they do not stop the process of our residents being able to speak, because this is their forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4659.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is their community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4661.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I will tell you, if that does happen Thursday night, I will do everything in my power to make sure they are punished in every way possible through the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4672.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, Councilor Marks, I will not try to delve into what you've already said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4679.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that it was stated perfectly, and I appreciate you standing strong, and I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4686.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna sue our own entity here in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4690.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not afraid to stand up and make sure that our citizens are safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4693.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=473.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=475.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we move forward and we're seeing the uptick with numbers and what we're hearing is that the state isn't really going to look going backwards at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=487.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we move forward and we look at the issues of opening school and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=494.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: opening of the city council for meetings that be interesting to know if there is money that's still needed to the school system and what type of money they've used moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=505.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, and to see if there's, if there's need that we need to address as a council to move some initiatives forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=512.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I put that out as a resolution and hopefully my colleagues agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=587.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=589.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we get closer, we see the unbelievable completion of that beautiful building, our police station, and something we should be very proud of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=599.183s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, it poses a bigger issue once that building is open and the crosswalk where we've been talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=612.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: between south and main issues now with the police station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=617.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's going to be interesting to see what type of plan we have in place, or is there any part of discussion about putting in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=623.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that what was discussed in the past were the rhino lights, the temporary crossing lights that could be installed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=630.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know if that's going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=631.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it was mentioned, and I know that we did call for a meeting, hopefully, talking to Representative Donato.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=638.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're trying to get something for next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=641.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for next Tuesday at 530 just to discuss the top, one of the top 200 most dangerous intersections in the Commonwealth, Maine and South.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=652.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now that we have some money coming from the state and the state DOT now<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=658.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: agrees that this is one of the most dangerous intersections, and we need to move forward as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=664.77s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, with that conversation, to reiterate what I talked about last week, putting in the raised crosswalks as soon as possible to see how that can slow that traffic down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=675.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm hoping we get some answers, and we move forward in a positive light.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=684.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=701.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The hope is that the discussion tonight with this resolution, with the traffic engineer being part of that meeting next week, that'll be something we could draw out all at once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=709.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't want to delay anything else as we're moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=712.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=713.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1197.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: have the traffic engineer on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1956.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1957.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First, let me thank Councilman Knight for bringing up a very major point, a very important point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1962.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that what we're hearing from the state and what's being talked about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1969.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the fiscal damage that we're going to see in a year is going to be pretty damaging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1975.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think it's important that the request that he put forth a while ago that we do meet and really understand where we are, especially with the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1986.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the free cash and where we stand with that, and where we stand with our taxes and our collections and stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1995.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think it's important that we have an idea of where we are as we move forward, because let's not make this a secret.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2002.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Things are going to get really, really, really tough soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2005.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're going to have to make some hard decisions if we're not going to get the support that we need, both in the state and the federal side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2012.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2015.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second, I know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2020.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're looking at the raised crosswalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2023.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a great question, and it's something that was a great solution for the Central Ave location with Morrison-Parkes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2033.107s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because before that pilot program, it was just a speedway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2038.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then it made a huge difference, being on the school committee back then, that that was one of the huge concern with the kids in the neighborhood, and the bus stops, and so on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2051.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That is a huge concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2054.929s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But you see in neighbor communities, I know Todd might be familiar with it, I know that on Powder House Boulevard, there was an awful accident and a pedestrian death there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2064.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what they did there is they didn't put<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2067.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a raised sidewalk, but they put a raised roadway with arrows depicting the rise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2074.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it really slows that traffic down in front of that school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2078.289s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I can't see that being a major cost where it's actually, it was put into place very, very quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2087.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were no decorative blocks, but there is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2091.494s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a clear rise that slows down that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2096.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that if we can look into that, Todd, I'd love to get an idea if we can even possibly do that in some of the locations, including South Street, Main Street, as we're waiting for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2109.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: get through and see what they can do, but I'm just afraid we're going to get to a situation where there's going to be a death in one of these areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2116.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're going to be telling each other, we told you so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2121.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't want that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2122.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if there's a way that we can look into that and look at some of this money because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2127.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I need some clarity on what we're seeing around the neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2131.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know it might be like the 3,000, the 4,000, 5,000 hits with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2137.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if you do it 15 times in the community, it's $50,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2145.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's something that looks temporary all over the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2148.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have light white paint around intersection streets with these white<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2159.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're not cones, they're just sticks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2161.761s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And within the first week that I saw them, especially in South Medford, they were knocked over immediately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2168.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can you explain, is that temporary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2170.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that, how are we going to deal with that when it comes to, the question I had with the raised sidewalk at South and Main during the winter was, well, with plowing, we can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2179.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, with all these sticks all over the place, how are we going to manage that area in that situation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2233.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2339.563s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So with that, I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2340.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I really think something like that, where that's more cost efficient, but more importantly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2349.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's long lasting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2352.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you're looking at something that's $10,000, putting in that what they've done on Grove Street and add that to what you can do at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2362.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: at Central Ave, using that example, that would drastically slow down that dangerous roadway by putting those cheaper, more efficient hurdles to slow that traffic down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2377.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same time, not looking at, because I'll tell you the truth, Todd, I appreciate everything you guys are doing, and I appreciate trying these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2383.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when you're looking at putting in ten different areas with this temporary<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2391.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $4,000 hits here and there, to me, I just think that it's not worth doing it right now until we're doing the full-time piece and using that money to something like the raised roadway in Central and other locations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2410.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's my preference, but that's my concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2414.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I look at equity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2420.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've been talking about Riverside Ave, Todd, for a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2423.486s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't see anything here with Riverside Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2426.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a major complex with two of the biggest schools in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2432.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's been some issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2434.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've had some issues there with both lack of cross lights, with traffic calming measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2441.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And did we entertain anything on Riverside Ave?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2536.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this- And I just want you to know, Todd, you came into a very difficult position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2544.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and I'm not, this is just conversation that I've talked to constituents about, and just to share comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2550.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that you're doing a great job, and we are seeing a drastic difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2554.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think people in our community see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2557.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've committed to traffic calming measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2561.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And other than South and Main, I'm going to be honest with you, throughout the rest of the city, I think we've seen a huge support by your office in this community to say, let's try to find ways to make it happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2573.698s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I really appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2575.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't want to, I'm not, if it sounds negative, I don't, I'm just looking at other avenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2658.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=469.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3143.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3146.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I just wanted to reiterate my thanks to our team at LMH and thank them for always being on the other end of the phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3155.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I'd be remiss to say the backbone of communications, Sam Tarabelski.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3162.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's nice to see Sam back and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3168.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And just reiterate, we have bumpy roads and to have the commitment of a partnership with Lawrence Memorial and Hallmark Health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3179.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And hopefully as we move forward to bigger projects, especially in our backyard up in the heights in the future, that this partnership stays strong and moves forward in a positive light.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3190.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you everyone for all your hard work and we still have some more to go, so I look forward to our future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3196.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3674.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=4264.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Could you just clarify that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=4266.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I thought last time we talked, Mary Ann, you corrected me and said we were in the green, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5202.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5203.563s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mary, could you just reiterate, I know that I don't want people getting nervous if they read this the wrong way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5209.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You said that the way it's read, that if you talk to two students, one is positive, one is negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5216.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not the case, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5227.236s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, so there's only 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5234.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5239.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so one in two students aren't tested positive, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5241.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's just to make sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5243.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5243.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, thanks Marion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5363.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5364.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5366.297s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5367.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much, Marion, with all the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5369.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can you just, so where do we stand with youth sports?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5374.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are youth sports participating now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5378.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have they been approved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5441.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So LaConte rink is open then?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5445.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: LaConte rink is open?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5465.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one parent is allowed in the rink at a time with a child?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5477.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, and it looks like the kindergarten are back in school with their teachers, so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5485.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5489.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so what I'm getting at, you're seeing a positive trend here moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5495.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that I asked the last subcommittee, I mean the committee, the whole meeting we had to give me some bullet points that I can present to you as a guideline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5505.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had a great conversation, thanks to you, with President Asak from the Brockton City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5512.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they enlighten me on some great avenues to take to open up the council chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5518.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She also enlightened me that the good news is we can use our COVID funding to help fund the opening for open meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5529.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: like our city council meeting, so that was great news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5532.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that I have a question later to our city solicitor to answer some of those questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5537.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But now with the numbers that are increasing, I think that there's some pretty good strategies that I'd like to share with you down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5546.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you can help me out with some of those bullets that I could share back with you to open the council chambers to a safe limit and open it to those people that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5558.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: want to come to our meetings in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5561.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my last question is, I think that, where do we stand right now with Halloween?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5567.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that's going around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5569.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Has the mayor and the department talked about, as Halloween's coming soon, what protocols we're going to be reaching for or what that's looking like right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5579.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that something being talked about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6895.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6898.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mary Ann, I know that when we do our programs and we have the same situations where we bring in large crowds and so are you telling me that it's the custodian?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6909.999s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm assuming that anybody that comes into our buildings for contact tracing, we have a log for everybody that comes in through that entrance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6920.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have a name, a phone number, and an email address, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6924.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6924.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6925.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So do we have those logs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6940.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So our custodians have those locks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6943.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who has them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6956.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That frightens me, because we do that with our Board of Health next door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6964.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know how private and shaky some of these organizations are, that they sort of protect each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6972.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I find it amazing that we don't have, as they walk through the doors,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6976.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a simple check-in where we have clean pens, and then we have pens that are put into a separate area to be disinfected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6985.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And everybody comes in and signs that, and we hold on to that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6991.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if anything comes back from that church organization, that we know that we're contacting those people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7000.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I find it hard to believe that we trust outside organizations that want to keep that position in our facilities for future programming, that we would allow them to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7014.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope we consider that, because that's frightening to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7021.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7028.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know if Councilmax is done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7104.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7108.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7108.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm hearing it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7109.636s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I, again, I don't, I hope you don't take this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7112.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not, I appreciate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7124.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And don't take this the wrong way, but it seems like there's a double standard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7127.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We met the other day, and you were so adamantly against opening up these chambers because of the fear of overcrowding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7136.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same time, what you just said with these outside organizations, as passive as, as long as they keep six feet apart for 15 minutes, that's acceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7147.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So-.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7207.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, maybe you are, but I'm just, as I'm moving forward, because I'm trying to put two pieces together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7212.47s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You asked me to put a plan in place to find a way to open these chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7217.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm trying to figure out, because I asked help from our office, because I'm not in a public health background.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7223.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I asked for just bullet points that can help me with that, and I hope you can maybe sometime during this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7228.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what I'm trying to get at is just, if I present<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7235.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with the president, the rest of the council, a plan in place that has these new guidelines that this now new phase is brought in with what I can Google the partners that we have and that are using our facilities that got approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7251.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't mean to sound as trivial as it's going to sound, but if it's that easy, then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7261.115s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It sounds that easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7263.016s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not being disrespectful in a way just to let other organizations in and then limit this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7288.584s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7297.681s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7300.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, but that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7308.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7309.526s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll get to that later on in the meeting today, but that's a great answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7312.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7314.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, that's great, that's a great answer because I think that that piece of the public health side to open this chamber, that's one of the two components we had a crossroads with last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7323.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for enlightening me, and like I said, I'll go forward with Councilor Scanlon with the open meetings issues and concerns that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7334.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7773.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12000.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Ken, the petitioner again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12003.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're saying you have these emails?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12006.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can't hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12007.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12008.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're saying you have these emails?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12023.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12026.33s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you have any other emails saying that you were on an agenda?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12059.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then if I can, to our commission, are you familiar with this email that he's talking about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12065.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because to me, this is a big issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12068.571s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12098.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, so, and your idea that it was never construed that unless demolition is off the table, you're not welcome at a meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12112.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, I'd like to see that email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12114.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13258.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Council President, and thank you, Councilor Marks, for co-sponsoring this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13265.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think those residents do a great job with their curb appeal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13270.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They do the best they can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13272.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Every time I drive by, they're out there with their push brooms, knocking all the debris away from their front doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13279.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they're very patient, and we know that our DPWs try valiantly to try to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13285.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: keep up with those potholes and they fill them on a, I think it's a weekly basis, but I think Councilor Mock said it perfectly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13295.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's just, it's too far gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13297.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not a huge stretch, but it does affect those homeowners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13301.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And truly in a negative way, especially with the way they live their lives, which is very orderly and very neat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13308.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I hope that we could find a remedy for them and get that completely done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13314.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, like I said, it's not a big area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13318.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's something we could just move in and move out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13319.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13901.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have it in front of me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13902.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Public Works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13904.293s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm the chair, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13905.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It is Max Caraviellole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14805.231s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll second that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14811.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: John.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14812.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, Sam.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14812.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think I have two of Councilor Marks' three amendments, but I'm trying to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14819.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The second one I have is that there needs to be discussion of more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14919.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Real quick, I know I appreciate Councilor Bears bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14922.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's important that we do something, especially before the first snow falls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14926.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But Councilor Marksby, I think we all bring up good points and I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14930.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we could, it's ironic that my neighbor knocked on my door today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14935.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And something if we can add that we didn't realize until about seven months ago, the importance of our first responders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14942.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She was frantic thinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14944.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If this is the way of the world, she might be gone four days out of a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14950.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if that happens during a snowstorm, she could be penalized for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14953.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So as you go through the subcommittee, I know I'm not on it, but just point of discussion is really look at that as an option too, because I know it's tough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14964.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to distinguish what homeowners are first responders, but I think they'll be negatively impacted with this too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14970.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So not to say we don't need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14972.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that other communities have great programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14974.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know the community that I work for, they have four sidewalk trucks and they send those out, like Councilman Mark said, all throughout the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14983.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they open up every main thoroughway and every park and every school and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14990.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to have to put our money where our mouth is again, and give our DPW the tools to put this to fruition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14998.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because again, it is the safety of our pedestrians that we're asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15003.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15017.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, just be discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15018.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I trust my colleagues to make that a point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15643.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15666.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Paper 20585 and 28586, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15742.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: make a motion to combine, Mr. President, if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15744.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, uh, they're all the same owner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15848.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15849.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is Mr. Kapoor president today?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15875.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, I apologize for the delay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15880.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or shall I believe, it seems like all of these petitions, everything seems in order and all the paperwork is complete, but just a simple question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15893.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are all these hours of business just transferring over?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15900.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With the owner, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15901.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a change of ownership?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15904.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so everything else stays the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15906.272s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the hours on Middlesex is 9 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15912.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to 8 p.m., then we have Salem Street, 5 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15917.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to 11, and then the Felsway site is open 24 hours, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15930.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so strike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15934.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Middlesex, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15937.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a 24-0.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15939.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, that's the one that's 9-8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15944.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's closed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15945.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, I find everything in order, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15949.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15959.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Before I go, I know what I forgot, I thought I had a note.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15963.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we normally, for new owners, we put just a review, especially for the 24 hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15970.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If Councilor Knight can help me, is it a 60 day review?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15973.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 90- We usually do a 30 and a 60.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15975.548s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 30 and a 60 day review if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15978.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those are the only restrictions, if we can, just to revisit as they're new owners to check their standing as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15985.636s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15987.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Should I apologize?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15988.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15993.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, on the Felsway site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16116.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I guess what I'm saying is- Just an information point to the petitioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16134.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Does the petitioner understand that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16231.34s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good luck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16231.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16232.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16294.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16296.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just a clarification, it's Dr. Menon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16299.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's one of the partners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16300.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I might have made a typo there for the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16305.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I went back and I watched a few of the Board of Health meetings and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16314.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I find it interesting that we do have a consortium of physicians that work with our Board of Health Director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16323.33s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it would be nice, just like I said, simple as it is, just to get some ideas of what the health professionals that are working with our Board of Health Director in the process as we move forward and putting together a criteria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16337.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something that will help, I believe,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16339.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The Board of Health Director asked me to put together the plan, so as they move forward, I'd just like their input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16345.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16426.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16430.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I'm going to reiterate this council's energy to reopen the council chambers for the residents that have reached out, not to eliminate Zoom, but just to add another avenue for those people that want to be heard and want an opportunity to come to this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16456.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Talking to my sister colleague from Brockton, one of the things that they asked for with their city solicitor was, as we do here in the chambers, we have a limit of capacity through fire codes during our meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16478.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we relate it to the COVID crisis and we have a set number and posted such, that would be, from what I've been told, might be the avenue that we need to reopen City Hall and making sure we're not violating any open meeting violations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16497.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I ask this to be sent to the city solicitor to get her opinion and, again, to help me put together this protocol that the Board of Health Director has asked me to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16508.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16606.258s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, this is something that at one point I reached out to fellow colleagues that put this on the agenda as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16616.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is very troublesome and I don't want to wait until it's too late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16621.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As you, we had another pedestrian death as you saw, not in Medford, but in neighboring communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16629.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And before we get to this horrifying scene, I'm shocked that we haven't been there yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16636.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All I want to see is our, it's a very simple ask, is just put those raised crosswalks out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16643.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Slow traffic calming measures that we talked about months ago, and I'll revisit this next week as I ask for a committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16650.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We did get some great news today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16654.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As great as it is, I don't trust the speed of this outcome, but I'd like to share with everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16661.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know everybody got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16662.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hi, great news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16664.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I got a call today from Mike So-and-so at MassDOT.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16668.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They have identified the intersection of Main Street and South Street as a priority intersection that they would like to partner with us to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16676.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The initial design intersection improvement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16680.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They would hire a consultant to do this work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16682.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in consultation with the city and would like to know if there are any consultants that have been working with us on this intersection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16690.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: While we have previously been told that we would have to pay this initial design phase, they are willing to fund this initial because it is on the top 200 dangerous intersections in the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16703.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And because of this nexus with the shared use path, in particular the south method connector,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16709.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That would intersect Main Street right on the other side, Route 16.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16714.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Therefore, they see it as an important mass trails connection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16718.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mayor, please let me know, blah, blah, blah, Alicia Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16721.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I want to thank Alicia for doing her due diligence to secure this effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16730.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's sad that the reasons why aren't safety, it looks like it's connection, but we're looking at a dangerous intersection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16739.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I still want to move forward to ask our traffic department and our city administration to put the portable raised crosswalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16748.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: on those intersections to slow things down and give some information back to the dot as we proceed with this consultant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16757.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And great news, I know Councilor Marks last night spent the evening with the ever source team on the south street project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16766.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they approved speed bumps, I believe in a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16772.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I wish it was that easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16773.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wish it was ever source to get.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16777.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to make something happen that quickly, because this has been monumental to try to get anything done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16781.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A sign, paint, raise crosswalk, and I don't know what it has to take.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16787.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And maybe, sadly enough, maybe it takes a death to make something happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16793.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is something that we talked with with the last administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16796.571s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something we talked with the mayor as she was partnered with us here as councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16800.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now as our leader in our community, I impressed on her to please<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16805.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: put these out there, make this happen now, because I would hate to see something happen between now and the end of this consultant's report and changing that intersection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16815.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's finally been identified as a top 200 dangerous intersection in the state of Massachusetts, but we've all known that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16822.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for all your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16824.233s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16825.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is great news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16826.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I still move forward to make sure that we can do that, and I open to my colleagues, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16830.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16974.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Put it as a resolution next week that we call for subcommittee on D O D O T for this exact one, this exact reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16986.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can set up a schedule and meet with them, bring them face to face with us and our state delegates and, um, and have that instead of, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17012.541s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I amend that we call for a subcommittee with DOT, our state delegates, our traffic department, and our traffic engineer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17024.651s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And Alicia Hunts, I think she was on the forefront of this, to set up a timeline with the DOT to make sure this comes to fruition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17036.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we'll try to do that as soon as we can with the Council of Presidents hope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17040.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17042.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17389.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information, if Council March, if you could add one more line to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17394.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that the question I've had is what steps is the city doing for our employees that were violated and are having issues with their personal information?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17410.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What are they doing to support them, if that's okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17415.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=190.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=260.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=261.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see that Mr. Miller has all of their paperwork in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=266.272s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will move forward after maybe a brief, just a summarization from our petitioner and any questions from our Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=313.223s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=315.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if you could just give us a brief overview, Mr. Martin, so we can, and we see all your paperwork is in order, but do you want to just give a little few sentences of what this is to explain to the rest of the council what we're doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=393.424s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's great, so thank you, Mr. Martin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=397.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I've put in the American Legion post.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=402.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We appreciate everything you've done for our country and all the members, and I see that you've done everything that's required through our licensing department, so I move forward for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=414.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=415.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=593.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Bears?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=594.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1023.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you can, is this line, I'm not seeing if it's illuminated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1272.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1273.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, my question was answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1275.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that being consistent with the other signs, I think I would agree with my fellow councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1281.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1529.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1530.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, President Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1531.407s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know my concern also falls with the number of signs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1537.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To have one sign that says free vacuums, I think we can all see, we all know the location, we all see the vacuums.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1544.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But to have 13 signs, I'm just a little nervous of what would be added after that on those awnings, or what's hung on those awnings and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1555.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'd like to hear what my fellow councilors have to say, but I just think this might be a little excessive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1564.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4719.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Easily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4720.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Easily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5967.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5968.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, just to reiterate, I think that for what the Historical Commission has in front of them, it's a daunting task when you look at our community and its historical values.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5977.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we all, like Councilman Mark said, I think all of us<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5982.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that the situation that we were put in with this situation had a lot to do with maybe the COVID and the opportunity for both parties to meet in a mutual and respectful manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5996.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think both the commission and the homeowner were great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5999.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We appreciate the opportunity to walk through the site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6003.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That piece was glaring, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6005.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What's important to me is to sit in front of a home, not behind these chambers, but with the people involved, all in front of each other, face to face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6014.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it was something as simple as Council Marks' experience by working on this council for many, many years to just bring up a topic that maybe both parties can speak on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6029.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is what we're seeing, we're seeing the best of the worst case scenario avoided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6035.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I applaud my colleagues and both the historical commission and the homeowner to reach an agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6044.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because we've seen our share of greeted developers in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6050.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think this homeowner was very open and honest with us and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6059.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we'll work now with our commission to make sure that we are going to keep as much as the historical preservation that we can on that site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6071.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I thank my colleagues and I believe that's a good example of good government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6076.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6740.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6742.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6742.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7762.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7764.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like Councilor Mock said, I too supported this in 2016, but I will tell you, I think that because the process does take the time that it will take, unfortunately, this isn't something that this council created or this council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7781.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This council delayed, I think I was one of the four councils voted for that in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7785.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think Councilor Knight brings up a very important point that we started our subcommittee meeting with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7791.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's so much going on right now in our community that we,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7796.91s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The focus has to be on the bigger things in our community right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7800.814s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that needs to be done down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7803.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that hopefully as you see things turn and people are back in this chamber and we get to move things forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7810.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Kids are back in school and city business is done a little bit differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7815.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I'll go back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7817.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as of tonight, I think there are too many variables and too many issues that our city is dealing with right now to even spend a minute focused on charter review, considering that, like I said, it is a two to three year process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7830.92s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And right now, I think we need to focus on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7835.805s">[Scarpelli]</a>: issues that are in front of us right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7837.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, again, I thank both Councilor Marks and Councilor Knights viewpoints on both, but I will not be supporting this this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7846.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8046.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that there's areas to agree and disagree, but this is something we agree on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8051.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, what we don't agree on is a timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8054.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that as one council who voted for this in the past, and knowing that it's something that needs to be done, like our zoning and many other things, historical issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8065.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that this is important, but I think right now, I think there's so much that supersedes it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8070.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That if it is offered sometime in the next fiscal year, it'll be something that I will totally<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8075.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: support again, so I thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8647.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9544.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9547.692s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9558.582s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9859.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate Councilman Marks bringing that forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9861.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, what people don't see behind the scenes is the work that Councilman Knight puts in when the camera's not on him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9869.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that all the questions we had during those<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9875.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those meetings and before those meetings, it was always Councilor Knight that was the go-to guy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9880.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that he put in the hours and effort to really make us shine finally and get this through and moving it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9891.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's a lot of good reasons why we need this, whether you believe in it or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9897.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, we appreciate your work, Councilor Knight, and thank you again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10343.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11379.821s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpella.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11381.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, I appreciate Councilor Ike bringing this forward and this is a great initiative moving forward because I think Councilor Caraviello is right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11389.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But one thing that we've talked about and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11393.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And in most other communities, if not all of the communities, they have, I know Councilor Marks has mentioned a thousand times, a clerk of works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11402.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That when there is any type of job, it's up to the city to make sure when that job is completed that there is someone there that signs off and then rechecks that in six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11414.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's what we're lacking here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11415.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're lacking that layer of follow through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11419.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11422.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know how we could move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11424.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that as we look as we move forward, and the tight budget's going to be even tighter, but I don't know if there's an avenue that our DPW director or our engineer can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11442.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: look into and find that person that's going to follow through with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11448.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because I know with the short staff that we have, these things fall through the cracks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11455.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I think that as we move forward looking for an effective way of having a clerk of the works that's going to follow through with these is going to be most effective, I think, than anything here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11467.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12373.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12375.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12375.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for my fellow council members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12378.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to send congratulations over to Richie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12380.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, again, whenever there's a fundraiser and there's a young child going through some horrible issue and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12390.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's going to be a party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12392.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Richie's always the first one to call and donate and be there for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12396.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's why he's been around for 15 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12400.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's why he'll be around for the next 15 years, because he's always there when people need him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12411.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not speaking from experience, but the product's not bad either, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12417.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for bringing it forward, and congratulations, Rich.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12521.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12724.717s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12725.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I appreciate my fellow councilors bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12728.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that everybody said a lot of great things, and I'd like to just reiterate those statements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12735.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you know it's sad, but you know when a family lays and leaves a legacy behind, and that's what Teresa's done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12742.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12744.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: By the way they raise their children and how they conduct themselves in here in our city of Medford and the legacy that they're passing on is so important to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12754.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I thank them for sharing their mother with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12764.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Maloney was one of the best and I think that we send our condolences and prayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12770.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12836.236s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13426.768s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15862.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15951.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16035.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16036.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We reviewed Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16039.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Payne's paperwork, everything seemed in order, and has everything that's needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16046.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, if you could just give us a brief synopsis, and then hear from our council colleagues and vote this through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16092.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're just turning the permit over?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16097.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To the same location, same business?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16102.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16103.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: OK, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16104.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I move approval, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16106.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16231.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1375.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2990.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2993.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were some questions that when I asked, it was already taken care of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2996.486s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4149.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Seconded, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4557.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4734.035s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4737.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4738.859s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5371.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Flanagan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5372.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5373.487s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7537.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7544.107s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hate to interrupt, but Mr. Mochi, if let's say my neighbor who has a house that is 80 years old and she's a senior citizen and she needs to redo her windows, we have to now wait and get approval from the historical mission to get approval to get these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7566.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This could be a huge burden, financial burden on our seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7570.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The only reason why I know this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7572.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as my brother-in-law purchased a home, didn't know it was a historical site, and what would have cost him $5,000 for windows turned into over $25,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7582.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I find this a little scary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=10591.705s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15273.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15277.584s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let me, let me, uh, thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15280.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is difficult doing, uh, our meetings and zoom by phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15285.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's terrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15285.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you don't want to at times that someone's speaking, you have a difficult time to try to jump in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15291.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I, I appreciate, and I understand the black lives matter, uh, statement and it means so much because as I talked about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15303.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh... and many meetings the the discussion that i've had with my my friends uh... of color and talking to my uh... uh... black colleagues in and and former players in players in talking about you know the the actual black lives matter uh... banner it it it's funny how<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15326.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You can hear, I forgot, I apologize, the last speaker who just spoke, you can hear the intense hurt in her voice and that breaks my heart because as I talk to my friends that are black and we debate these concerns or lack of concerns,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15353.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You get, it falls into two sides, and that's what you're seeing happening in our community right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15360.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have people like the young lady who just spoke where, you know, how dumb are we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15366.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When it's affecting people in our community, how could we not want to support the Black Lives Matter sign?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15372.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same time, to bring in the politics of this, you do have organizations and my friends of color that have told me they felt<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15383.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that they're using this statement as a political movement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15388.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whether it's Medford, whether it is in Medford, as I talk to them, there is a divide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15394.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a divide in the black community about the Black Lives Matter, from the people I've talked to, my friends that I've talked to, and it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15402.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: sad to the fact where I'm getting texts right now from Black members in our community, I won't say their names, that are telling me that All Lives Matter means it should be thrown away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15414.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Of course it should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15416.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would never, ever use the All Lives Matter in the context we're speaking in right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15422.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because we do have racial issues in our country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15429.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think it's important that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15431.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still have to understand this is a governing body that wants to support everybody in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15440.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we also want to make sure that, like council said, we go through the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15446.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, it's comical because for me talking, you've got to be careful what you're going to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15452.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I've said this when I first started running for office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15456.16s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm going to do what's right in my heart for what I think is best for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15460.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I was a school team member, it was best for the kids in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15463.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now it's for everybody in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15465.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I have to live with the decisions I make, right or wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15469.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it's comical that in a past meeting that I had hundreds of phone calls from my former players and my friends of color that said, George, why didn't you respond to that woman that called you a racist?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15484.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, geez, I'm sorry, my dog was barking and I happened to let my dog out and I couldn't defend myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15492.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I find myself sitting back saying, to use my background and what I've done for people, white, black, yellow, green, what I've done for people I would never use as a platform.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15510.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when it affects your family and affects your kids,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15513.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they're being talked about or brought out for something somebody says, the people that don't know each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15522.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It stopped dividing this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15526.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the point that I'm trying to make is very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15530.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Black lives do matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15532.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as I stand with my friends of color, they know George Scott probably knows that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15538.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a city councilor, I know that I want to follow the process that Councilor Marks has put forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15545.353s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, Medford needs to start to heal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15548.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we need to start to bring Medford back together again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15552.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a reason why everybody moved to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15554.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Medford is a great community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15556.763s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We love Medford, all of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15559.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15561.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whether you're fighting for your own social causes, or whether you've lived here for 35 years, it doesn't matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15571.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have to find a common ground to bring Metro back together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15574.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I've heard so many people, the disappointment in our elderly, in our people that have just moved to the city, to say that, why are we so divided?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15584.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to come together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15587.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we need it from the leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15589.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now the male will follow this process, and then we will follow this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15593.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if the Black Lives Matter sign hangs in Medford, and that now sends a message to everybody in our community that we stand together with Black lives, that's the process we went through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15605.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we shall be proud of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15609.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same time, to say, everybody say that this isn't a political statement, this is what's dividing us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15618.16s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because A, it is, and then B, the people that are looking at it the other side, they're not looking at it as how to help our black brothers and sisters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15628.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's being looked at to say, well, let's look at that political group that's breaking our community down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15637.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And in a sense, yes, it does make some people look racist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15642.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't think that's the intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15645.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, I'm not naive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15647.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Racism does exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15650.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I tell you, when I talk to my friends of color, and I talk to them, and how sad it is when they tell me that their kids are afraid to go to school because of one reason or another, or our white kids are afraid to go to school because they're put on a list that they've used a racial slur.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15675.47s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's dividing this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15676.671s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to find something that's going to bring this together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15679.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can follow through with Councilman Moxley's suggestions, and we make sure we dot our I's and cross our T's, and that's the resolution that we now hang the Black Lives Matter at Methodist City Hall, and that's the way we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15696.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to find a way to stand together and heal and stop dividing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15705.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So believe me, I work in the community that first put that banner out, and I'm telling you, whatever you want to think, whether you're white or black, I heard from every single color that came to talk to me that looked at that as a platform instead of what's really intended for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15725.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it divided people in that community, both black and white.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15730.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And black people were for it, and black people were against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15735.171s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is bigger, this is made up bigger than it really is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15740.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it has, and it shouldn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15744.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So all I beg to everybody in our community is let this take its course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15752.698s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And let's find a way to all come together and heal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15756.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because when we voted on making<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15759.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: making, um, uh, announcing, uh, racism, uh, public health emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15763.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I voted no on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15765.183s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I got feedback because I'm racist, but here we are here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15770.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We are months later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15774.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And like I said, nothing has been done as a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15779.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done nothing to bring people together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15782.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've asked for our black leaders in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15786.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've asked for our black leaders in our schools to find a way that we can meet together with social distancing with the COVID.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15793.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We could use that excuses to a blue in the face, but we need to meet together with the police chief, the superintendent of schools, the mayor, the city council, the school committee, everybody that makes the decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15805.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we all understand how we need to heal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15808.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know one council said, shame on you want, you want, now you want people to people of color to teach us what's wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15816.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, we need to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15820.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because that color of skin does not match theirs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15823.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we've never lived what they're living through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15826.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15828.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Overly winded Mr. President, but I thought I knew that had to be said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15833.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15868.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, Mr. President, I'm going to say, if I can interject, and I appreciate Councilor Morell for saying that, but it's easy to say what you just said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15877.47s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the truth of the matter is, it is a political statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15880.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15882.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We could all say it's not, but unfortunately it is, on both sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15888.233s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we need to find a way to get through this and stop hailing from that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15891.514s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have to acknowledge this stuff and move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15894.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15894.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16180.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16181.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16183.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is what I'm talking about, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16188.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A figure of speech has turned into something that I now have to read about racism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16195.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've worked 35 years helping kids of color of the Latino race, Asian individuals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16206.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've helped hundreds, if not thousands of kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16208.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've sat in their living rooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16210.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They sat in my living rooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16213.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've cried to me for issues of race.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16216.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've come to me for guidance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16219.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've gone to them for guidance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16222.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we talk about race, I don't look at a book and read a book about race.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16225.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I sit with my brothers and sisters that I coached and taught for 35 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16232.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when I say the people that called me racist, are there ignorant people that don't know George Scarpelli?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16240.999s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just because this Councilor wears his heart on his sleeve and will say what needs to be said does not make me weak because I'm a white privileged man.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16250.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It makes me understand what we need to do to move forward and that is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16254.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what I've learned by talking to my friends of color that I've talked to that they've sat at my dinner table and had dinner with my kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16265.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my son and daughter walk into a room, they don't see a color and thank God for that because we've always had an open door policy in the Scarpelli house that everybody was welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16278.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I never looked at a kid because of his color, the color of their skin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16284.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So maybe I have to educate people in who I am as a person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16287.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't need a book.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16289.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll read it just to enlighten me a little, but to understand when I deal with racism, I deal with racism standing across the boys and girls, the men and women that I've helped in my life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16308.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's who George Scarpelli is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16309.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: George Scarpelli, when I brought up the racial comment,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16313.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was offensive to all the kids that I've helped in their lives, getting them into college, helping them fill out the FAFSAs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16319.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I envisioned, I've sat through systemic racism for 35 years as a high school soccer coach, trying to help kids get into college universities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16334.313s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these are the concerns that I have with people in the community right now that have tagged people like George Scapelli and others<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16342.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as racist when you don't know who they are as people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16346.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So yes, we need to grow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16348.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16350.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to make movement because there are racial issues in this country, in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16357.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But please, let's find a way to come together and not divide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16362.231s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16409.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16410.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, and this is why when people speak from their heart, it's taken from the people's vision that's across them that they want to correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16418.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I say this, I do not, I've never in my life used about me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16423.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'm telling you, the education that I've gotten about racism doesn't come from anybody else, but the people that I work with every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16433.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't question who I am as a person and I'm not trying to defend myself or protect myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16439.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm trying to enlighten the people that don't know George Scott belly to let them know that I've gone out and I've listened to people and I understand what they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18402.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20800.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The clarification, especially this evening, I think that it is time to move forward and pass this on to the next step so we can get this process to fruition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20811.747s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's something I know that the Mifflin Brewing Company has been waiting for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20816.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that the truth of the matter is it is time and it would seem to be prohibited if we didn't try to find our ways to make sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20828.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we take care of the organizations that stuck with us through thick and thin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20834.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, I wish them the best of luck as we keep moving forward with the light stabilizers that they need, but I'm willing to move forward with this this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20844.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=21151.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22055.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22070.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, so... Mr. President, I guess we've lost the feed too, I'm told.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22079.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The feed for the television.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22083.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I guess the quarters ran out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22342.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22361.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So bear with me if I don't hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=23657.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2806.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second that motion, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2899.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President and thank you for the I appreciate Councilor Marks bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2904.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that We've talked to many residents who?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2908.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: felt a little slighted Tim with the taking of those parking spaces and We can understand the biggest the biggest draw for myself as well as the bike lane is the intersection of Ruben Street and High Street and having an identified crosswalk and a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2927.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh an area now that people are going to have to stop the way they're going to reconfigure that area so i think that is a huge plus it's a it's a to me a huge safety issue we have right now um and and with council mox's uh<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2942.814s">[Scarpelli]</a>: remarks with the with the with the turn I think it's very important and I too was I to talk to a few of the neighbors and the Request I appreciate how it's a mark soon as homework and getting chief Buckley to read to consider the parking overnight I think that's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2959.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So Again, it's all the Brooks parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2961.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We we heard you loud and clear It wasn't at any point that we thought that you know, we don't want to move forward with such you know an initiative, but we also have to make sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2973.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They had to know that we got into this game really late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2978.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, once you've clarified the hundred residents that have been informed and have an end product with the taking of the land,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2990.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the continuation of the bike lane to make it a true bike lane where I too shared Council Mark's concerns with the dangerous situations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3000.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then looking into that evening parking and the configuration of the high movement, I think it's a no-brainer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3008.77s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I too will support this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3011.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I thank all the Brooks parents that originally started this years ago, because I don't know if any of the parents that originally started this project are even in, you know, their children still go to the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3024.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I applaud those parents and moving forward with this initiative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3028.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7238.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I agree with Councilor Marksley and Councilor Naidoo, but I remember, you know, Councilor Falco, I remember the tradition, it was the Friday of Father's Day weekend and then the vote of the school committee was that Monday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7252.859s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was that's what the deal was and we didn't like it then and as this as the we started the process as city councilors We didn't like the process either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7261.526s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I I will tell you the reason why I would like to see this information from our department heads Because this is what other communities are doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7269.532s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've sat with my department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7271.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've gone through a five percent ten percent twenty percent reduction With a level funded budget from last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7277.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it prepares us so we all know we're all frightened of what's going to happen or what could happen<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7282.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at least we're prepared as a department that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7287.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I am the assistant running that department and getting prepared to, as the time runs out and the state is dragging their feet and the federal government hoping for a buyout, I think we need the opportunity to see what's in front of us, to see what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7303.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't think, you know, the fear is there anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7306.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand what Councilman Mark's saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7307.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think it's our privy to come out and say, okay, look at the budget fire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7312.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to have to cut 20 people, God forbid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7315.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it's also,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7318.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: understanding what we're going to see in front of us, not at the 12th hour like we have in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7325.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And believe me, I don't blame this administration at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7329.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the hard work they're doing, getting the auditor in front of us and talking to us and giving us forecasts, but I don't see what it will hurt to get this information in front of us right now from all our department heads so we can understand what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7343.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The school department's doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7344.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They understand the situation they're in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7346.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're meeting with their department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7348.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're understanding this situation ahead of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7350.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why wouldn't we, as a city, be prepared in the same situation for the same situation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7355.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So like I said, I know of other communities that are doing a 1-12 budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7360.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've already announced that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7362.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know communities doing a quarterly budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7364.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've already announced that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7366.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what we're seeing is at least they're getting minimal information, maximum information that they can receive, so they're prepared to move forward with their thought process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7376.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because this isn't going to be easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7378.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We all know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7379.532s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We all know that if this stays status quo, this is going to be a difficult, difficult time for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7386.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And being nervous,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7389.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, as a municipal employee, I'm nervous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7393.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I look at our numbers, I'm nervous that I might be losing my job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7397.264s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it comes with the territory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7399.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think as city councillors, getting that information in front of us is going to be important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7404.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's why, you know, I understand, I don't want to put the fear on anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7407.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But unfortunately, sometimes understanding something maybe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7414.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When your back's against the wall, this is when people push to our state delegates and reach out to the governor and reach out to the federal government, reach out so the president can hear us and say, listen, we need maybe not a trillion dollar bailout package, but maybe some kind of a package that we're focusing on our state and local<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7434.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: local governments to support us and what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7437.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So sitting back, I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7439.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just don't think that that, I think we need, I don't think we need to go after it and help and scare people and the sky is falling mentality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7448.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think we need to be prepared as a council to see what shortfalls are coming with each department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7453.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's important to what we have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7455.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I support that initiative, Mr. Councilman Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7459.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7746.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7746.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7747.373s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate Councilor Bears' initiative to try and think outside the box, but I too, I think using an analogy my dad told me is, you know, to pay off your car, remortgage your home, to look at the possibility to pay a $20,000 car loan over 30 years that now it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7768.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: piles on top of what your bills are, just doesn't, I can't see that this concerning us today, leaving this to our next generation to pay for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7782.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So believe me, I appreciate that maybe there's some other ways that we can think of creating revenue sources and bringing money in and trying to focus on being<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7795.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know being creative and gutsy to go out and do it, but I think bonding our way out of that I just I I can't support that so I just want to make sure I made it public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1616.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1616.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, there were some concerns earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1620.814s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know there are some limitations, we do have limitations of the information we can give about the person that has already been diagnosed and found to have the virus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1632.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it safe to say or could we say that it has nothing to do with the schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1635.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I think that was one of the concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1636.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I think the kids right now, they're feeling anxiety probably more than anybody right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1643.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So just making sure if we could just say it has no one to do with the schools and we're safe from the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1673.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3421.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There is a suspension in communications from the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3563.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3565.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3566.77s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that you coming up, I know that it's a little nerve wracking when you're coming up to speak, but you did a great job in presenting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3574.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we've had some of your student body here before, some of your friends, and they've brought up some great initiatives, and we're so excited that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3584.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: here again, and our goal is really to make Medford beautiful and share what we're truly about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3592.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that the four categories you chose for Duggar Park, I think it's a great<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3600.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: way to spread that love.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3602.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think you guys have done a great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3603.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is a great initiative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3605.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that my son John is also doing some great things with a great historian, Mr. Ken Krause.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3614.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So everything is nonstop and it's so exciting to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3617.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I fully support this paper and move forward for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4008.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4009.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I talked to the petitioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4011.65s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4013.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm requesting a table till next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4017.373s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Table till next week?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4018.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4511.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, through the chair, to Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4514.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In layman's terms, if people can understand,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4517.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This resolution is really to have the voice of the people heard and not stifled, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4541.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And in recent, as we can see, we had some discussions about open meeting laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4549.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that I applaud my fellow Councilor to look at these concerns under transparency to make sure that the people are heard and we're giving them the proper forum where we're not stifled and they're not stifled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4565.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I applaud you with this resolution and I support it wholeheartedly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4570.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5289.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I too applaud Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5293.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that as a municipal worker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5296.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: who's someone who doesn't take sick days, people that are out there might question even with this intent, you know, that this is compromising city funding, but what they make sure they understand the way that it works is when people retire with the bank of sick days, they're then bought out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5317.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you could look at, we're going through that right now where we have a custodian that is battling<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5324.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: cancer, and he has a family of four, and he looks like, thank God, he's going to pull through, but without the sick bank process that we have in the community that I work in, that individual would have lost his home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5338.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these are real issues, and this is what I think what Medford's all about, in helping your neighbor and your<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5346.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm actually shocked that I didn't know that we didn't have it in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5351.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I applaud Councilor Knight and I second the resolve, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6052.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, I understand Councilor Marks' hesitation, but I think the meeting we just had in the subcommittee that outlined the limitations we have as a council now that limits our residents to come up and speak, I support this for the fact that being sponsored and having<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6073.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: an avenue to make sure that the constituent has a voice and is on the agenda as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6081.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because I think this is going to be a huge culture change in understanding what we can talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6088.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So as Councilman Mark said, I know that the biggest issue we had in subcommittees where in the past a resident would come up, have a concern, a serious concern, but we would support that by having a dialogue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6104.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: by the rule now, that violating the open meeting law, that limits that now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6112.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It eliminates that completely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6114.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can't talk about it, so Mrs. Jones comes up and talks about some serious issue that we need the police involved in, something that I believe was emergency or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6126.453s">[Scarpelli]</a>: natural disaster that we can speak on at the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6129.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it limits different speaking points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6132.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So with this, I support it for the fact that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6136.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If there's an issue, we have a constituent that has a problem, we assign the number to it, we sponsor it as a council, and make sure that that issue is presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6145.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is why I feel that it's needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6148.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's all in the same breath.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6149.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we're all looking at making sure that our constituents are heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6155.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And understand again that this is going to be a big change for what we're used to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6161.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when doing business, when people come to that podium, because what we were told by ruling of the attorney general is that we can't talk to you as a council in fear of violating the open meeting law on concerns and issues that are brought to that podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6178.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So whether we like it or not, this is the reason why I support Councilor Knight's motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6184.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7992.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, being close friends with both, um, the Morse brothers and understanding that, uh, what Mr. and Mrs. Morse have done left, uh, with, uh, teaching their children, uh, that community is very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8008.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to lose her was a great loss to Dennis and Hank, but I know that we wish them well and share our support with their family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8020.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8925.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, I can understand Councilor Knight's presentation, the understanding that we've had some recent, uh, recent concerns, but I, I too, with Council Marks, I know that the Felsway has turned into, um, you know, front yard, um, parking areas and it does take away the appearance of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8948.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think, um, although in good intention, I don't think I can support this either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8953.681s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9043.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please, if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9045.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The motion to suspend the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9058.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9059.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Petitions, presentations, and similar papers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9062.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we've had a petitioner here waiting patiently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9064.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 20-100.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9065.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9066.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9120.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President, and forgive us for...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9125.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: having you sit so long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9126.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that all the paperwork is in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9130.209s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have everything in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9131.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that this is a Lambert Street location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9136.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have you worked in the field before?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9138.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have you been in the business before?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9139.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9140.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9141.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9142.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what type of food do you bring to this location?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9148.582s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it just pizza or is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9153.563s">[Scarpelli]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9154.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9155.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How many people will be working for you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9159.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9160.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hours of operation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9166.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9167.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that falls on the premise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9168.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, I have no other questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9169.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9363.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9365.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just public for the viewing public, I know that I've received some emails from constituents that are totally against this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9372.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, to their understandings that this is something that was voted on in 2016.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9378.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we are required as a city council and a city to provide, I believe, at least three licenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9388.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whether you're for it or against it, I just wanted to reiterate that this is a mandate after the vote that was taken and moving forward with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9399.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that Councilor Knight has already contacted us to move forward quickly and get a resolve and move this petition forward, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4126.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4127.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=12027.272s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=582.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So as a coach for 32 years at the high school level, you really try to find inspirations for kids to follow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=589.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You, sir, are a true inspiration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=591.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this city is proud of you, Mustang Country's proud of you, and I wanna congratulate you on a job well done, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=597.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=598.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nice job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2402.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2404.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To be redundant, I think it's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2405.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I thank Council Marks for bringing up such an important issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2409.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the emails and the phone calls I received, I think the frustration goes more in depth than just what we're seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2418.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The whole lack of information, the fear that's still out there that hasn't been answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2424.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we move forward, I wonder if we can put an amendment that we can have the Acton City Solicitor to see if we can extend that period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2436.041s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the 20th is the date, I believe, so- Yesterday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2441.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yesterday, so if there's a way that we can put a hold, if there's a way that the city can freeze that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2447.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's some issues that if you have,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2450.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: some of the members in the audience where other communities have put a stop to this, there's something to be gained by understanding that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2459.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So having our city solicitor find any loophole that can stop this ASAP until we get the answers that Council Marks has brought up, I think it's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2470.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'd like to make that into an amendment if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5576.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5702.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, President Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5706.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For those who might look at the census as just an irritant piece of mailing that almost every family gets, every household, and then disregarded and thrown away, I assure to spread the main<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5725.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: issues with the census is making sure that Medford gets as due when it comes to funding from the federal government for education, police, fire, and so on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5739.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's important that as the process is now getting underway,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5744.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we get an idea of what our plan for our city administration is to get the word out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5752.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Neighbor communities I'm seeing are starting a ground roots effort where if you see what the census is doing, they're now offering $28 an hour for workers knowing that it's important to get these issues and these numbers verified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5769.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as you can see, Medford is now a very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5773.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: diverse community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5775.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And with that diverse community comes people of questionable residency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5785.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one of the concerns we have are those numbers count.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5791.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those numbers are very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5793.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we've met and I've talked to different census bureau members that have talked to me about this being a federal law and how this cannot hold against anybody whether their documentation is updated or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5808.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it's something that we need to make sure that our administration has a plan in place that will reach all of our families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5817.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we have an opportunity that it's being sent out in a variety of different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5826.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The important thing that I'm finding out is that the census now, seldom are we gonna see paper versions of the census.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5834.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You can now do it on the telephone, you can do it online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5838.928s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many different ways to get this information that's so needed in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5843.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'd like to know, I know that from what I've heard that Neil Osborne is going to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5851.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: spearheading this, but I'd really like to know his plan and what we can do as a council to make sure that they're doing everything possible to get the word out and the comfort level to all the residents of this community that this information is vital.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5867.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to make sure we get everything that's due to us and from the federal government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5872.183s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for hearing me out, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1876.695s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Chairperson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1976.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1976.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3381.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I really do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=4352.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=690.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: come to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=691.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The Secretary will call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=75.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=76.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First of all, I'm talking to the chair of the subcommittee on zoning and ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=81.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that they've been drafting up a few of the ideas and presentations of what we're looking for moving forward with development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=91.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One of the biggest concerns that we hear now is the lack of housing and the lack of the type of housing that makes Medford the community that Medford is, which is housing for families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=103.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that looking into<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=106.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the rules and the policies that we need to jump in a little bit deeper in seeing what we're doing to make Medford continue to thrive as a community of families and looking to possibly increasing our affordable housing to what is acceptable in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=130.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we're still at, I believe, 10%, but I think it's something that needs to be looked at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=136.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Another piece that's alarming, you can see it in our community next door, they're having huge concerns with residents there that were accepted into the affordable housing units in different condominiums and now are being told by the developers that are there that they now need to move out because of the popularity of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=162.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: of selling those condos as individual units and they're being asked to leave and given a mere $1,000 just to move out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=169.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think it's important that before<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=172.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I shouldn't say this before, but it's hitting us now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=175.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we need to take a more active role moving forward and ensuring that what we're doing to protect our residents here in Medford with our added development and how we're looking at affordable housing is presented in a way that we hold the values of our families in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=195.115s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So with that, I appreciate the time, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=198.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=199.796s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=298.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=299.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=301.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This came about with conversations indirectly with the new director of recreation,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=309.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: members of the park board and members of our youth organization and also my background in working with facilities management and playing fields and knowing what we're doing in our community where I work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=324.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and preparing our playing fields.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=326.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One thing that we know that our DPW is drastically understaffed and I want to make sure that as the weather, if the weather continues the way it's going now, we might be playing at the beginning of March in a few weeks, hopefully so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=342.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we need our playing fields in a position where our children<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=348.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: can play in a safe environment and making sure that we're giving, making sure the city administration is preparing those fields and giving our DPW and parks department what they need to make sure that those fields are under, um, uh, supervised and make sure that they're, they're, they're, um, planned accordingly moving forward as we get closer to the season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=368.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=368.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=369.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Knife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=504.651s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a petition here this evening, if you can come on up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=516.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=524.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, Justin, the hours, it seems like the hours are gonna stay the same, and I know you provide a valuable resource to that neighborhood, especially to my son, so I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=538.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it seems like everything is in order, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=542.427s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I move to accept this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=546.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Dello Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=794.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=796.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President, Councilor Knight for bringing that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=800.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=801.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we're talking about such a serious situation, part of our discussion was the involvement of local politics and local municipalities to get involved, and really now pushing our state delegation to bring on to Washington what we think is something that needs to start at the local level, because we're seeing major<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=826.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: major catastrophic situations not being addressed by our brothers and sisters in Capitol Hill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=837.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that the President has made some moves today, but I think that we need to now start<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=845.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as a local government pushing our state delegation to making sure that they're presenting our views here in Medford that we can't stand for this type of violence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=856.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And say what you want about freedom of having guns, but there's a severe issue that's going on right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=867.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that the city of Medford should take ownership and start taking the lead that we can now push on to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=875.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: press legislation to change our gun laws in this country and making sure that the way people can purchase firearms are looked into in a more drastic, dire way because what happened this past week and what's happened for the last few years and so on,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=895.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It needs to stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=897.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It needs to stop today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=899.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we need to take an active role as local government that if our senior delegation is not taking that step, I think we need, as a voice of Metro, to now start pushing that along to our government, our delegation in Washington.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=918.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I hope that our, my colleagues,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=924.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: support that and move forward with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=926.541s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=927.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=928.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4731.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4733.18s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4734.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not going to... I won't be redundant what my colleagues have already issued, but I do have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4739.822s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we have parents that need to talk,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4742.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have to express my displeasure, Roy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4744.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that how hard you work as an educator, one of the greatest superintendent minds in education in the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4751.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think what we have with this situation is something that in many layers bothers me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4757.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a former school team member, we were adamant that notification was paramount to whatever situations moving forward at that time, and obviously that didn't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4768.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate you coming out and saying that you're taking responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4771.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate you saying that this isn't a forum for personnel matters, but I know as a parent, as a parent of two children in the Medford Public Schools, we need to see something happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4786.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There has to be something done, Roy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4788.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't something we're going to push to the side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4790.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something has to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4794.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I know we don't want to say it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4796.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't want to live in fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4798.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I personally think the opposite now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4800.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to live in fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4802.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are scary times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4803.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our kids are afraid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4804.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this would have been a great learning process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4807.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Imagine getting into a classroom and teaching the situation of bringing this type of dangerous ammunition and weapons into our schools and understanding how we could teach our children how important and how scary this is because it is scary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4823.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Society today is scary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4825.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's frightening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4826.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, I've talked to my kids about this just the other day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4829.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, Councilor Knight and I talked about this when I talked about our local government taking action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4833.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then this happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4836.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm so disappointed, so many different levels, because I'm going to beat the dead horse with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4843.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's bullets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4845.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's ammunition to a weapon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4848.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: of mass destruction, where kids have died just recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4851.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there is fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4852.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There is heightened fear in this room and at home with our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4858.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I need you to understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4860.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we don't want to be afraid and we don't want to, you know, we want to make sure that our kids feel safe in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4866.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I absolutely agree with you, and we do a great job in our school system making sure we feel that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4870.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But you know what, I think society has to realize, when things get done, it's out of fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4875.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is fear, this is necessity now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4877.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to have to start at this level, this is something that I'd have to put a huge black eye in what didn't happen in this role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4885.739s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This was bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4886.999s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This was bad in so many different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4888.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that I'm sick of just even discussing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4891.842s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But moving forward, I know the parents need to talk, but we have so many members in our community, our school community, that you work so hard to protect and making sure that our students with mental issues and are disabled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4907.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are our kids that are right in the front line of situations like this, that we need to get answers for to make sure they're protected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4914.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, again, as a former colleague of many of those teachers there who taught with them and went through the lockdown situations in that course, I can understand, but we need to do more with this situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4930.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to know that if it happens again, a bullet is enough, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4935.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A threat is enough that we have to let our children and our parents and our faculty know what's going on so we can prepare our children to make decisions what we think is right and safe for our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4946.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, again, believe me, I hate to be a heavy, but I tell you what, I am so sad and so disappointed that this wasn't presented in that fashion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4955.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know Dan Tully, he's a very thorough individual, and I'm sure he brought it to the attention that it was going to be reported.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4963.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and it wasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4964.437s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we need to, you need to move on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4967.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that the investigation is one thing, but as a leader of our school system that I, that I entrust with you, we need to make, we need to make some hard decisions tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4976.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Roy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4977.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=10011.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=10012.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, good job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=10013.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I apologize, I find the records in order to approve them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=10017.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7121.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would just sort of...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8688.695s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12664.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12920.839s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=618.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=619.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scott Billy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=620.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=622.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, Councilor Markswell, reiterating what, I don't want to be redundant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=628.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You brought up the same points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=630.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that in today's, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=637.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Studies have shown that we want more people off the street and out of cars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=641.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when we're prohibiting people or welcoming people to their nearest bus stop, I think that's exactly what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=649.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're limiting them from using public transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=652.02s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I second the resolve from Council Marks and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=658.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to put a timeline to that, that we get a response back within two weeks if we can, and if not, I want to send this to subcommittee and ask, I want to give it to the timeline, give it a few weeks, and then what I'd like to do if we don't have the proper response, I'd like to hold a subcommittee meeting with the representative from the T. If that doesn't, if we don't get,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=685.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: information back, because we know the lack of communications from the MBTA has been with this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=692.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that we need to hold their feet to the fire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=696.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when you talk about that one area, it's a dangerous area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=701.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to put a picnic bench out there, it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=708.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it's disheartening when you talk to some of those neighbors that see what might happen, uh, what goes on in that area and a negative note when, um, when there is, when they, when they are waiting in between buses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=722.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, I second the resolve from, uh, Councilor Marks and, um, amended, uh, well, to see if we can put that within two weeks if we can, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=736.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: an answer back within two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=738.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=738.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1394.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1396.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1397.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1398.459s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, my colleague, for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1400.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that months and months and months ago when we first were presented, I was one of the councils that voted against it because of the lack of information that went out to our constituencies, to our community, and with the opt-out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1418.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in discussions with neighbors, where neighbors that have been very conscious about purchasing their own energy and they're valid in understanding what the situation was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1432.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I did my homework in visiting a few communities, one of the biggest pluses were<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1440.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The plan that was put in place once it was passed by each community, and the plan that notified our residents about the value of this process and the option of opting out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1455.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So one other thing that I want to point out,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1458.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: question that came about was who would fund the notifications, all of the work that needed to be done to let all of our residents know about the opt-out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1469.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And with our last meeting and having the director from Melrose who came in and spoke so well on this issue, we answered a lot of questions that were brought to my attention that people had<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1483.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: asked me about and how would we find out who would pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1487.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, it all comes under the company that would be awarded this project if and when it happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1498.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my biggest concern wasn't the community aggregation plan because I think it's needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1508.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's something that every<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1513.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: constituent can use in bringing their electricity bill down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1517.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, not dramatically, but it does help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1520.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, the biggest piece was getting the notification out to our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1526.477s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I was pleasantly surprised and optimistic now in making sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1533.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When that plan is released to the public, it's going to be very thorough and with as much information and time needed for our residents to opt out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1546.805s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because again, one of the issues we often hear is a lack of notification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1551.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, with this plan, it falls back on the company that's awarded this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1558.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that in turn goes back out to our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1563.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate Councilor Longo-Curran for bringing this up, and I second her motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2789.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe we tabled it because they didn't they couldn't complete all the questions we had and they didn't get to to explain their whole Communication plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2802.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's a and then we're completing it next week So is there a way that we can get?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2809.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe the city engineer can give us some information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4531.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4532.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4533.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to be redundant, but I will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4537.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that the issues of having that master plan, I think it's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4544.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we wouldn't be true to this position if we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4549.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: weren't looking at the bigger picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4551.379s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the truth of the matter is, as one person put it, to hold this valuable historic piece hostage, in a sense, would be frightening to me if we would lose it over the winter because we didn't fund it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4568.609s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, we weren't part of those discussions years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4572.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think the plan that was put in place, and with the CPA that's now in front of us,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4579.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we talked about last week, using the Brooks Estates as a viable revenue source, I think it's something that, as someone that worked very hard on the recreation piece over the past few years, and talking to our friends from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4600.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the Brooks states and looking into different avenues that we can capture funding, I think it's a positive move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4607.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the thought of possibly losing the Carriage House to me is unacceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4612.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So one thing we did preach over the last few years is our support to our historical sites.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4621.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to, in my eyes, I feel that this Carriage House is one of the granddaddies of them all, so I'm going to support this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4630.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1037.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1039.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1352.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1358.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1359.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Your name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1373.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We did discuss that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1374.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's part of the 200 feet that we were told that Winthrop street will now have sidewalk throughout the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1381.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's national grid is going to take care of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1383.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not a national grid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1384.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe it was ever source.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1386.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was already set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1387.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1389.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we'll be, that'll be part of next week's meeting too, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1392.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can see this part of the MOU.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1394.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe it was in the MOU.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1395.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1396.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1396.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1397.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1400.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Anyone else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1580.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, for one, I know that this council has worked very hard with making sure that our, uh, our natural grid never source and other utilities do what they need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1592.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I find this disheartening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1594.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This will be the first time I'll see that, that announcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1596.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think this is something that we'll, we'll get on as soon as we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1600.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for coming out tonight and, uh, and sharing your opinions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1604.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1606.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, we have a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1608.541s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you have any other, anyone else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1609.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1610.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How's it going?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1927.779s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1929.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I think this is, we just had a Committee of the Whole meeting with the project being done with Eversource.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1936.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one of the biggest things we talked about is, as we move forward with that before we approve it, is having more of community input and making sure we have community meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1944.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I find this disheartening that this has happened again to this neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1948.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, I know that you have champions behind this rail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1951.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're going to make sure that we can do what we can right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1954.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, uh, Mr. Vice president, if you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2149.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2149.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: On the motion, Vice President Mast, that we amend the paper that be forwarded, the mitigation, the Traffic Plan, and the Clerk of the Works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2163.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: neighbor communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2164.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's the four pieces I believe that we need to send to the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2169.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's amended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2171.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2171.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So second, uh, Councilor Knight, all in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2363.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Consumers appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2365.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're going to, on the motion, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo that this go to subcommittee on economics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2463.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what his job is, to make sure those ones<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2473.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Leave a note.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2508.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2510.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: On that, on that motion seconded by council dollar Russo to, uh, move this paper to subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2538.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's been tabled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2539.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, they're not coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2541.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have the motion to, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2610.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Records were stolen by Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2612.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were tabled records of meeting October 17th were passed to Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2617.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mungo Kern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2618.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's not here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2619.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Records of the meeting, October 31st, 2017.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2621.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll pass to vice president marks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2624.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How do you find those?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2628.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2629.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: On the motion table, those records all in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2632.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Opposed guys have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2634.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So motion motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2636.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Del Russo seconded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2639.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Falco all in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2641.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2642.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4821.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I thank fellow Councilor John Falco for bringing that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4825.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can amend that, if we can maybe add the digital speed monitor, maybe to slow people down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4835.507s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Also, I know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4837.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, we've worked both Councilor Falco and Councilor Kern have been working with Sergeant Hartnett on the traffic issues as that's a major cut through, especially with the future work that's being done up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4851.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that might be something we need to rekindle for another subcommittee meeting with the hospital site and then bring Officer Hartnett.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4860.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know they did a report, a traffic study that counted the cars that went through that area and it was pretty<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4867.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was pretty astronomical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4869.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think if we could put that, the, the machine there, if we can ask the chief to put that up there so people can see the speed limit and maybe that could deter some of the speeding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4881.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But thank you again for this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4884.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7073.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7074.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7075.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, again, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7076.661s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, my fellow councilors bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7078.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that just to shed some light, this is one of the, uh, first meetings we had with, uh, the recreation focus group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7085.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about, um, facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7088.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one thing we did talk about and have met with the mayor's office is that, uh, a dual function, whether it's recreation, whether it's the art council or, um, or S or such other,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7100.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, facility, but I know that they've had, um, the building inspectors in there and for the sole purpose to see what we can do for housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7110.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, such very important, uh, um, initiatives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7115.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that they've, they've been doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7117.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I too, if we can call for that committee of the whole meeting and, and get an update because I, you know, the, uh, the activity that was there could have been, uh, the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7129.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the builders that were looking in to see what needed to be done there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7133.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Obviously we know the police have been there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7134.821s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, I know that the mayor's office has been actively, uh, searching and working with that site to see what's best for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7143.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm pretty excited about the possibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7145.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for your input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7147.209s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=21.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>
