    <a href="https://youtu.be/GbhjYJ_J4oE&t=59.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would make the motion that we bring the city council pay down so we don't have restrictions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QjAOAB8_UUg&t=16.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm honored that a friend of ours who's worked so hard for firefighters to capture grants and take the pressure off our citizens and our tax base, Secretary for our union, Danielle Marcelino is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QjAOAB8_UUg&t=31.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Welcome, Danielle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QjAOAB8_UUg&t=251.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=15.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Tonight, we have to thank my team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=18.945s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's so many of them, but I want to thank everybody that's here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=21.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you're from all Medford, if you could just raise your hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=23.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just thanking you for being here tonight and helping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=26.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=31.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've had a few events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=32.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know tonight's a tough, tough night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=33.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we had about three different events tonight, but we said we need to do something because things are happening really quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=42.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the reason that we're here is because we wanted to talk about the Proposition 2.5 override and the debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=48.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there are three questions that will be on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=52.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll give you some more information later on after a few people speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=58.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But one is the debt exclusion, which is for a new fire headquarters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=66.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm very fortunate that we have one of our union leaders from the fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=71.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Danielle Masolino is going to be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=72.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's going to speak in a little while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=74.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And proud to say someone that I called and asked his opinion because I think he is probably<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=82.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the smartest educational mind, at least in Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=87.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's someone that I respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=89.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And sad to say, I don't think people respect him enough until that person's gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=94.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I called this gentleman and I asked him some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=99.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And within five minutes, you just feel better because he just educates you with his knowledge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=105.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I asked him if he can come out and spend a Friday night to come out and speak and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=111.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: give his opinion and what, you know, his perspective as an educational leader, someone that ran our school system for many, many years, still works at the state level, high level at the state, and he's gonna share some of his knowledge, and then we'll fill in some gaps that people had that had some questions, and we can help educate everybody so they understand what this means on November 7th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=134.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So right now, I'd like to introduce my friend Roy Belson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=19.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right now, for the November 5th ballot, we'll have question six, question seven, question eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=28.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Question six is a debt exclusion, like I explained, is a tax that you'll be taxed until the project or the bond is complete, and then it comes off the tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=40.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that reads,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=43.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That exclusion on fire station shall the city of Medford be allowed to exempt from the provisions of proposition two and a half, so-called the amounts required to pay for the bonds issued in order to pay for costs of construction, a new fire station headquarters to be located at 120 Main Street in Medford, including the payment of all costs related design, the project equipping and furnishing, the project site improvements and all other costs<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=72.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: incidental to related there too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=78.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you'll vote no, because that's been a lot of people's questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=82.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: George, I thought you supported the firefighters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=85.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, when you hear it straight from the people that I think Danielle put it perfectly when she said, we don't want to sound like the angry people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=96.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Instead, look to see what our firefighters have gone through, what our men and women have gone through in the last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=103.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and how they've been treated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=105.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And yet again, they're gonna stand up and say what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=109.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What you're offering was not transparent, was not inclusive, was a decision made in a box, and the funding is gonna hurt our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=122.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they're willing to stand up and say what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=126.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'd rather not have our residents of Medford hurt<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=132.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: financially for an inferior product.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=136.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please do not vote for question six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=141.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Danielle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=148.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Question seven is funding schools and street repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=155.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Shall the city of Medford be allowed to assess an additional 3.5 million in real estate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=161.368s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and personal property taxes for FY25 general operations of the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=167.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $3 million includes but not limited to funding costs for teachers, literacy coaches, behavior specialists, administrative assistants, nurses, and for regular facility maintenance and for FY25 general operations DPW, including but not limited<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=188.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to additional staff for road and sidewalk infrastructure repair for fiscal year beginning July 1, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=196.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, this question seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=202.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $500,000, come on, for the roads and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=207.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: ARPA, when it was originally put forth, was directly supposed to go to infrastructure needs, roads and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=220.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=222.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now we sit here and say we're going to give them $500.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=225.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=227.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is an issue that I put forth years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=230.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We tried to put a sidewalk and hot tub crew together to save the city money because the mayor kept coming to us for $2.5 million bonds for sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=242.258s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we never saw sidewalks being done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=244.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We could never catch up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=246.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know my colleagues say, see?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=248.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: See?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=248.78s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=249.16s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have no money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=250.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=252.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=254.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I love the dialogue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=261.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Public schools, teachers, literacy coaches, behavior specialists, nurses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=270.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The superintendent has already, the expert in the state has shared some amazing information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=280.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have we been resourceful?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=283.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Has the school committee and the school department been resourceful in creating revenue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=290.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=293.223s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know my colleagues will say, again, he's not telling the truth because their social media sites tell you that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=301.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I have shown everyone, very simple, meeting after meeting, and if you want to look up, watch them on YouTube,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=309.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: From step to step, we showed an avenue to come out of this without hurting kids or teachers or schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=318.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We showed them that avenue through free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=322.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what did they do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=325.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They imposed a rule to shut me up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=329.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=332.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One of our members got a phone call from a school kid member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=337.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that school kid member said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=339.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How dare you put a no sign on your lawn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=345.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are you going to be happy when we lay off 40 teachers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=348.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Shame on that person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=351.429s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because that's the same exact question I posed in the open meeting in front of everybody and said, why put the schools, the children, the teachers through this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=362.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Take the $5 million out of free cash,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=366.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: put the fear away, and then let's all get to the table and make the right decision for our community with an open and transparent process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=378.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that, ladies and gentlemen, question seven, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=391.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I like the drama behind this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=394.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Question eight's intense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=396.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=397.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So question eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=399.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This override will expand vocational programs and increase student access to the arts by giving us the funding to pay for new programming, staff to help students succeed, fix the school schedule at the level and increase educator and paraprofessional compensation to ensure living in competitive wages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=420.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Doesn't that sound expensive?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=422.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Vocational.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=423.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe what it is, Roy, you can help me if I'm wrong, is expanding the day, the school day, and the vocational day would kind of merge together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=435.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what we're asking for, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=440.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe it's maybe through negotiations will be the biggest cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=446.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, what we're looking at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=449.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is nothing close to $4 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=452.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not even close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=453.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not even close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=456.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Understand the trend here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=459.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Six, we heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=460.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Seven and eight, education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=463.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Understand every single community that has fought for an override in their communities has used what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=471.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the children, and the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=474.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Don't hurt our children, don't hurt our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=478.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I asked my colleagues, and we've heard people on the other side that's supporting this, where were you the meeting that you shut me up when we asked for free cash that we had?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=493.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you were there, and you still have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=498.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So let's understand this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=501.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now that you know the questions, let's go all the way back now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=506.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And let's make sure we get this and people can hear it, you can share it with your friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=512.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All Medford, at no time have we ever said, we're against an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=519.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We do not want it, never.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=521.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was never said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=525.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=527.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: was let's fix what's wrong now with that $5 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=531.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's bring everybody together to the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=534.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's have an open and transparent process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=537.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And let's work together to make sure we, if the need is there, that we fulfill it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=545.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And don't divide the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=548.764s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is what has happened now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=550.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now we're dividing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=552.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now it's yes or no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=553.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll be honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=556.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a responsible member of this community, if I didn't think now that we're here, there's nothing we can do, we'd have to step away, I'd step away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=565.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we have $34 million in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=569.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $34 million in free cash that has not been used that can recover this funding and make sure that we do this process correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=579.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=582.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And for those who don't know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=586.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just a quick step-by-step so you understand it's never quick with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=591.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had our budget meeting last year, the year before last.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=596.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And my colleagues were in unison, Councilor Caviello was there, Council President Beas was there, and we were all together in the process that we cannot support this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=610.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's too dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=612.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we were all for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=616.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Until the night of the meeting, Councilor Carviello and I stood there, and our council leadership team came out and said, hey, we just met with the mayor behind closed doors, and we're gonna vote for the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=630.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've come to an agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=631.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What agreement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=634.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't know what agreement it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=635.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Carviello and Councilor Knight didn't know what agreement it was, but there was some sort of agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=640.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, as this grew, we kind of realized what the agreement was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=644.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A financial task force was created.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=649.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A school kid member, two city counselors, the chief of staff, and the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=657.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Five people with no background in financial battles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=664.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=666.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At least not enough to lead us to the spot we need to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=672.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=673.65s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This financial task force is meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=675.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't hear anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=676.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are no minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=677.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's no information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=679.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're told we're going to get in a meeting before we do anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=684.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, you hear rumblings, so we call for a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=688.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have our city council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=691.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe it was the week before we had a subcommittee meeting, and a very smart red<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=700.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They said, so if you ask for an override and it doesn't pass, what does that mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=708.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That means devastation for the school department and our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=714.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Imagine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=716.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I came back the following week and I presented a plan that said what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=723.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Use our free cash, let's come to the table and do the right thing for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=729.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and let's not leverage our kids in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=735.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But guess what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=738.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's called Rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=739.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council Scott Pelley shut down, can't speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=746.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is how we're getting messages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=748.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The Financial Task Force's plan was an override plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=752.11s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was what they came out with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=754.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We asked for the minutes, we asked for more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=756.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How did we get there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=757.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who was involved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=758.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=761.274s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now maybe the other side, because my friends are telling me, George, they're beating you up, they're beating you up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=765.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=767.78s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is all true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=769.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is all on tape.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=774.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, typical fashion, Friday we get emails from the mayor's office with $7.5 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=785.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Tuesday we come to a meeting, we're gonna vote on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=789.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a responsible city councilor, I will now invoke our Rule 21, close the meeting, and ask for an open meeting with everybody to talk about this in more depth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=802.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something that's unheard of, has never been heard of, never been done before, but our council leadership suspends the rules of the meeting and imposes a vote to not invoke Rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=819.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Done, you can't talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=820.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you, the council had five subcommittee meetings to talk about a city council newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=828.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=830.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And guess what that, that's free, nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=834.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But, the paper's adding up to $7.5 million and possibly more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=841.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They don't wanna talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=842.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, what do we do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=844.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We move on to the next meeting and I said, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=846.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I reach out to my state representative and I asked him, what is the plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=850.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What can I do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=851.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they said, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=852.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Legal from the state said you can now invoke Mass General Law 43, section 22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=859.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That supersedes any method rule, shuts the meeting down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=863.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, we get to the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=866.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our leadership team does the same exact thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=869.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Suspends the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=871.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Imposed, says they cannot impose rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=874.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I then invoke section 22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=879.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council leadership says, no, you can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=884.437s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Against the rule, against the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=888.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because what was gonna be said is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=893.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And listen closely, because this is how real communities do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=897.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In 2009, working in the city of Somerville, Mayor Joe Curtatone was at a crossroads with his community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=905.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Big cuts looming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=907.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He convenes a group, a working group, a financial working group that consisted of financial minds from Tufts, MIT, Harvard, banking leaders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=920.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You had the Sloans from Century Bank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=925.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You had his financial team present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=928.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You had community leaders and business leaders all in a row.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=932.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they worked on a plan because they said you needed to figure out three things before you wanted to go to an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=938.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One, how do we get there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=942.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still don't know how we got here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=945.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At least publicly, there's nothing been mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=948.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Two, how do we fix it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=951.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Three, how does this never happen again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=955.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what we were taught.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=958.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, they came out and they said, okay, this is what we're going to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=961.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to look at traffic and parking fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=963.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not going to make people happy, but they're going to take that money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=965.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're going to increase those fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=967.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're going to take that money, and that's going to be dedicated solely to the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=973.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Boom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=974.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Need taken away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=976.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=978.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need streets and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=980.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How do we figure that out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=982.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The focus is fees and fines for trash and building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=988.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And boom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=989.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Developers pay for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=992.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then the third piece, the most important piece, they sat together and they said, well, what can we do so this never happens again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=998.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How do we bring Somerville out of this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1001.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, they started this little project called Assembly Row.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1006.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now, whether you like it or not, there's a lot of money coming into the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1012.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, maybe you might question the growth, maybe question how they got there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1016.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not what I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1017.794s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'm saying is, that was an open process<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1021.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with financial minds that sat together to find a solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1027.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What has happened here, both in the fire department and the school department, it's been done in a vacuum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1035.316s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nobody knows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1038.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that a member of the community did file a FOIA request asking information for, we're waiting on that, hopefully we get that soon, that we can share with the community of what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1050.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: was shared, minutes, any notes, anything taken with this financial group?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1056.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who were the professionals they might have brought in that we don't know that could have helped them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1059.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nobody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1061.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here we are today, middle of September, people still don't know that there's an override vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1070.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like Councilor Caviello said, he had explained to a person yesterday, why are we fighting it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1075.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $7.5 million for a new high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1077.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1081.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1083.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1087.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So people are saying, you know, but, you know, Councilor Scott Kelly shouldn't be doing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1091.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's a city councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1092.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't give a shit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1098.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm going to fight for what I think is right so every citizen is heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1102.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I will tell you, it's not that I'm new to this, or I wouldn't do this, or I wouldn't have the guts to do something like this, because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1110.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were three former counselors in this room, and only one of them, sorry Rick, only one of them put forth a debt exclusion that was probably put together by the best financial mind in Medford, an Alicia Nunley, and we looked at the process of creating funding for a new main fire station on Main Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1134.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it was so simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1136.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We would exclude senior citizens because you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1139.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're hurting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1141.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Senior citizens are hurting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1145.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The vulnerable community, our disabled, our veterans, eliminate that group, those groups, and see what we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1154.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe at the time it was $17 a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1158.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We could swallow that, couldn't we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1160.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But that was with the process that gets started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1162.763s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even with this process right now, nobody knows what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1166.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still don't know what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1168.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing's been posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1170.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know there's rumblings that money's already being spent from free cash out of $34 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1177.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing's been done yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1180.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So having this meeting tonight is so important, this fundraiser's so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1184.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I tell you, I gotta thank so many people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1188.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The restaurants that donated,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1190.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: LaCasha's, Ronnie's Place, Richie Razzo's from Razzo's and Avellino's always donate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1197.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1201.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The thousands of dollars that were donated just the other day was amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1209.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And guess where that money's coming from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1212.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1214.268s">[Scarpelli]</a>: hard-working, method residents that want to do anything they can and fight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1219.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My neighbor, who's 84 years old, came to my house today and said, George, I can't come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1225.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He has $8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1231.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, God, no, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1234.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I tell you, what we do know is Kelly has done a great job with the real estate side and understanding the assessing side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1241.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have Nate Merritt's been doing his deep dive into the calculator that they have on their site that says all you do is poke in these numbers, bam, it's always this much money, you can handle that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1255.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Bullshit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1258.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I'm gonna tell you straight up, $380 for a person might sound not a lot of money, but some of the people I've talked to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1269.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I keep saying it, I won't use her last name, but I love her dearly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1272.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see Mrs. Jones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1274.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She said, George, help me understand this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1277.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I bought my house 50, 60 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1281.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So $48,000, I believe she said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1283.582s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think I tell people $50,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1286.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But now my house is worth a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1290.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My husband died 15 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1292.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was a seamstress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1294.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My social security doesn't cover my taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1298.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So should I move?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1300.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Some people want them to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1302.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I haven't heard one thing supporting our senior citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1306.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I haven't heard one thing how we're gonna help those homeowners that are struggling to stay in their homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1311.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Cuz one of my council colleagues actually said to me is, if your house is worth a million dollars, just take a hundred out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1318.663s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1320.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The understanding of not understanding what a home equity line is, that's devastating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1326.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Devastating for a resident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1329.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're not candy coating anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1332.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not hiding anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1333.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything you see has been public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1337.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have told my council colleagues what they're doing is dangerous to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1343.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still don't see the information how we got here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1346.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The way they want to get out of it is by taxing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1348.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Here's the other piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1350.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hey, it's only this much money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1353.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I hear that again from people, I'm going to lose my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1356.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because understand this, and I'll end with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1360.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What did we talk about one of our first meetings subcommittee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1363.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Rent control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1365.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then we talked about a transfer tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1368.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then we talked about a registry fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1370.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we talked about overrides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1376.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it stops there, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1377.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1379.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because my brother, I'll use my brother for example, just got his house assessed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1385.096s">[Scarpelli]</a>: An additional $400 a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1389.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, he's a young man, works very hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1392.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hopefully, he can recover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1395.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But then, Kelly did some homework, and we found out his assessment in 20 to 24 that's starting now, he thinks it's over with the assessment side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1406.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But Kelly, what are we hearing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1407.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In 2025, you're gonna get the sales data for 2023, because the peak of the real estate market will pass your home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1419.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's going up again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1421.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So have we heard any of that in their homework?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1424.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1426.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it's only $400.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1428.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But let's go a step further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1432.33s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A minimum $200 million renovated high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1437.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who fits that bill?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1439.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1441.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We want a new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1443.477s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A new one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1444.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Take it down to one new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1446.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Looking at $400 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1449.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You people don't understand what that number equates to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1454.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1456.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's scary and it's dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1460.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I didn't want to bring you out to scare you, but I brought you out to wake you up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1465.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This group never wanted to say no to an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1469.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we heard it from the smartest educational mind that I've been around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1476.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we haven't seen enough creativity, we haven't seen enough information, and there has been no transparency to show that we need this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1488.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've talked to our fire department, our firefighters are saying, don't hurt our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1494.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Don't build something just to check a box.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1498.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't want the fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1501.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1503.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if they're saying it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1506.792s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I've spelt it out for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1509.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a very simple process right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1514.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Fix the budget with $5 million in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1518.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's move forward and think of different ways to be creative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1521.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's be shocking and look at new growth and development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1526.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something we haven't seen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1527.922s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Am I lying, Ricky?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1531.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How many 40B jobs did we lose?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1533.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Three, how much money just in permits with those three projects?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1538.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Millions of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1539.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then tax revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1541.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've done the homework on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1542.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How much?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1543.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $16 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1543.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's one building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1544.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, these aren't lies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1546.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are true numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1547.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, you wish you had a platform<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1562.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I've been shut up way too easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1565.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, in this forum, I'm not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1566.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you're my voice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1567.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're helping us spread the message now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1570.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1572.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a list right now of over 600 volunteers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1576.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 600 volunteers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1580.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have captains that are going to be doing standouts that we have about, what, 60 to 80 people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1586.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 60 to 80 people already signed up to do standouts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1591.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm asking all of you, October 15th, Zach, if you wanna come on out, we're gonna meet at Hormel Stadium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1598.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody's gonna come out and we're gonna take our message and we're gonna go to the neighborhoods and we're gonna knock on doors and we're gonna give people the information that no one in the city has given them to help them understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1610.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Understand the rest of everybody else, don't be afraid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1613.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If a school kid member knocks on your door, it's a shame on you beyond that you have the information right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1620.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: beyond that you know the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1626.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So tomorrow, when you go to the coffee shop, or tomorrow when you go next door and you talk to Dave and have a cold drink, sit down with him and say, hey, do you know about the overrides?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1636.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the fire don't want it, the educational minds think it's absurd, and it's going to hurt people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1645.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here's the other piece that I seem to forget, and I don't ever want to forget this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1652.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have lived in a, grew up in a home with tenants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1655.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My dad made sure that we treated our tenants with pride and with respect, and we made sure we kept our rent reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1663.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the fact that my brother took that, and we still have the same family there that have been there for 10 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1670.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That family pays for a four bedroom in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1673.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They pay $2,400.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1673.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Pretty cheap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1676.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We all know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1677.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He will not raise that rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1680.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What people have to understand, if these taxes come about, taxpayers cannot handle this on their own.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1689.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's going to be passed down to the tenants, and renters are going to go through the roof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1696.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I want to thank all of you for coming out tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1700.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did I miss anything, Rick?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1701.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are you sure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1702.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's my captain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1703.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Rick's going to tell me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1705.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, again, I will tell you,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1707.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've got great people working on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1709.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm so excited for the energy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1712.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right now, we have 260 signs already on the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1716.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Steve's gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1717.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have 260 signs on the street, and we have another 200 here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1723.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Make sure you take your sign, but make sure you leave your name and your address so we know you've taken it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1730.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And show your neighbors and just give us a call, just so people know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1735.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: An override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1737.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you vote for an override and we give the mayor $6 million, even though they say that the money is going to go to the vocational school or art programs, that's not necessarily true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1753.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The money goes into the general fund to be used to the mayor's discretion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1758.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so again, there's a reason why we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1763.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $9 million<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1768.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1770.183s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those people that want to know real simple what free cash is, free cash is the money that we approve for the prior year in the budget that the mayor does not use, does not spend, and then it gets certified and carried over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1784.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then it goes into an account that she can do anything she wants with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1790.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1792.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I hope tonight what we really wanted to do is educate some people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1798.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: bring them out, have them know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1801.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Understand that we'll be having, if you please sign up for the standouts, we'll be doing door knocking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1807.666s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the big one is gonna be October 15th, Saturday, nine o'clock at Formell Stadium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1814.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna be meeting there and we're all gonna be hitting the streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1818.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna be going into the neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1820.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna be knocking on the doors, talking to your neighbors and letting them know that if this is voted through, it's not gonna hurt the children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1828.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor's just gonna have to put the money that she's playing with back to where it's supposed to be and help our children and help our schools and help our seniors and our residents so they don't get killed with these taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1841.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, thank you all for coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1843.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have a safe ride home and we'll talk to you soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=262.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Before we go on, can I just address my original question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=268.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=271.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Pete, there are questions, um, that I know that, um, there were some questions about council rules, about limitations when it comes to, to, uh, meetings minutes and how long we could speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=283.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if there are follow up questions, and if there's one question, I believe council bears explain the process that we're using.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=290.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, uh, as council president, I think he wants to move this meeting along, but I just, there were some senior citizens that mentioned,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=298.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if there's some confusion, I hope we have a little leeway when it comes to maybe asking the same question twice because of maybe not understanding it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=306.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I hope we would do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=308.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The other question that Councilor Behrs did read, did speak about is that we all asked for information to be sent out to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=318.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor's response, I believe,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=322.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The chief of staff did respond that legally the city couldn't inform or given, I'll just read if I can just so people understand, cause it's a little confusing to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=337.859s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sending this information request, so it's, we sent this email to legal on today to guide us on what we can do, should avoid doing before we can assist given the OCPF guidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=350.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One specific question in mind is whether we can intentionally direct notification advertisement to subset of residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=358.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the following is up on my email below, per council, we can't send unsolicited information<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=365.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to all voters or a portion of voters of the city, whether by mail or by email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=374.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We got that, that response was today, correct, Council Beers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=376.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was 10 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=378.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=378.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we knew that and we needed to change wording, I think sending out an all call that we were having a meeting that would, it's open to the public, that just read the resolution, I think that that wouldn't have been an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=392.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just wanted to share that with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=394.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=398.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=404.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council Adam, did you forward this to everybody?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=843.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that the word transparent gets thrown around, Ted, and I hate for you to get dragged into this, but you weren't part of any financial task force for the override, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=856.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I was not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=856.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=859.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Normally, when communities put this into place,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=863.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm told from different communities, different assessors, finance directors, that they usually line this up prior to any budget meetings, so we can help our most vulnerable people in our community understand what any impact it would make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=878.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So having this calculation that you're doing for us, and thank you so much for doing it, because I know there were so many questions with the calculations that have been public on the side that you had nothing to do with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=888.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it came out of a state website, but it didn't truly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=894.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: calculate the newer assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=896.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's correct, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=898.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yep, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=898.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we look at this and now we're doing it on the 11th hour, the question was normally in your experience, other professionals in your field, this is done usually during budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=913.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can prepare our residents that if there was an increase of 373 median price,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=922.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're prepared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=923.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it sounds minimal to some people because it's only, that's all we keep hearing, it's only, but is it odd that we're doing this so late?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=945.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=947.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=950.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any other questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1135.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1136.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With just a couple more questions, I know that you mentioned that this doesn't have any impact on question six, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1143.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not in fiscal year 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1145.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because it's not enough time to put everything in, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1148.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know the actual numbers, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1155.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, but we still don't know how much for question six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1158.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's an open-ended, as it said in the question, there's nothing there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1169.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1170.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I realize the exemptions are great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1173.424s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but I know that there are options when you do this ahead of time is to really prepare your seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1179.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know the exemptions sound good, but when you read them and you talk to actual people, there are a lot of senior citizens that really don't fit in that category.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1187.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there are no other options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1190.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know the buzzwords easy to say, we do have exemptions, but when you put it apples to apples and you sit with the senior citizen and you go through their situation, I'm sure you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1200.171s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mrs. Jones bought her house with her husband 55 years ago for 50,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1204.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now the house is appraised at a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1208.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, it really doesn't help what we're offering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1211.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's a funny number and there could be something done more if we had time for an exemption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1218.621s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1219.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that if we had time, this is something we could petition to see if we can really truly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1224.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: support our senior citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1226.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that must be said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1227.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think the, the last piece to this, I think that when they look at this and because one question I have Ted is that a lot of people have asked, not just seniors, um, that the, this is like a one time tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1240.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1241.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you see that 4% above your two and a half percent increase, that's going to be compounded year after year after year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1249.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't something that's going to go away like debt exclusion, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1257.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, so that'll grow forever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1259.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think the other piece that people have to understand too, and it's a tough office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1264.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just, when you hear the misconceptions, I just need your input to educate our residents and understanding that, again, I believe the mayor said her house is only $13.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1275.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Some others here said their house is $40 a month or whatever, and we can handle that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1281.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That might be the first year, but again, we were told, I think someone from your office emailed us and said that we'll be reassessing again in 2025 for 2026 using the data for 2023, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1310.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1311.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1312.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for helping with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1313.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it increases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1313.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1314.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, when this tax goes in, it's now assessed again, the homes will be assessed again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1323.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, but we're seeing that most assessments, because I could tell you, I'm dealing with my own family members that are looking at a $400 increase per month for his new assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1336.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1337.183s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that what people also have to understand is that it's not just the home tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1342.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've seen their cars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1347.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Motor vehicle excise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1348.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Vehicle excise tax is going to go up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1350.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're going to see the CPA tax because your homes are going to be assessed higher now, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1354.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now the CPA tax will also be taxed higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1357.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're going to see that a little bit higher, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1360.18s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, that's yeah, that's generally correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1366.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1367.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what you're seeing is, it's not just it's not just an override tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1374.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's an override tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1375.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's compounded year after year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1377.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a tax that increases in the CPA as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1380.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the excise tax that increases as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1383.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's so much more than just 13.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1385.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's my point I'm trying to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1387.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's easy to look at a site that wasn't put forth by our office because we know that although it's correct, the numbers that my colleagues did put out there on a page, it does give the numbers that are true and factual, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1403.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That didn't include the assessments that residents had, and I'll use my brother's example, because his house was appraised at, on the calculations, at $800,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1413.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: His house is now appraised at $1.2 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1415.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's why we're seeing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1417.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's not odd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1419.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is family-owned homes that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1422.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we passed on to generation to generation, just like most people in this room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1426.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1427.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know I'm monopolizing the time because I think it's important, because these are the questions the people that are sitting in this in this room right now and their friends have contacted me and said, we're very confused, Mr. Scappelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1438.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because even something simple as, Mr. Scott Pelley, why are we fighting for $7.5 million for a new high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1445.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm like, no, no, this has nothing to do with the new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1447.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1448.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And people understanding that, well, this is a fight between schools and kids and senior citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1455.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not true at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1456.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just want to make sure all the information's out so every resident understands the impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1462.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that, and we could talk about solutions as we go, because there are solutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1466.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were solutions back in April, but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1593.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is the microphone on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1597.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Andrew, is the mic, turn the mic down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2045.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let me start off by first saying that unfortunately this administration has divided this community for the children in the schools and the seniors or the homeowners or renters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2057.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I say shame on this administration, shame on this council, shame on the financial task force, because the bottom line is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2065.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This group knew that we were heading in some tough waters back in June 20th of 2023.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2072.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you could see that in a city council budget meeting when council beers met with the mayor behind closed doors to set up some sort of deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2081.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't know what that deal was, but they created a financial task force and that financial task force put together a plan of an override without anybody's knowledge, anybody's input or any,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2094.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or any community participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2097.747s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are no issues with our school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2101.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a fair tactic and fair tactic only for the fact that we should remember this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2107.29s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Back in April, back in May, back in June, when the city had $25 million in free cash, it was my responsibility to bring forth that we take that $5 million<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2119.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: levy that budget, make sure there were no cuts, understand the process, and then move forward to see if we truly need an override, which I never said that should never be an option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2130.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But to hear parents and teachers and friends and family say, George, explain this to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2138.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Villes knew that this was gonna be a devastating situation, but it could have been solved and still could be solved with free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2147.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have plenty of free cash in the system not to turn the city upside down or divide the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2153.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, remember, I'll leave you with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2156.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're asking for in the budget<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2159.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in this override doesn't mean you'll get exactly what you think you're gonna get.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2165.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because all these cuts were made to set up this override as a fair tactic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2169.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2169.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2170.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli is not against the children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2173.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just hope that people understand that this could be soft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2178.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2530.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2532.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think I heard some similar situations with, I know what the assessor came up and gave us medium price homes, but we're seeing real people have told me that this is what we're seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2544.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're seeing the increase close to $60,000, most homes that you're seeing an increase at a higher percentage rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2551.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, on top of all of what we talked about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2554.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with this, so it's not the $13 a month, the $40 a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2557.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the pieces that this gentleman just said is the understanding that I never thought that our home insurance now will now increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2568.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, this isn't them against us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2572.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is understanding that we have viable options right now to fix this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2579.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with free cash and then work together to see how we can have an open process to really include all the stakeholders to make sure that, uh, that no one is hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2590.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2917.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2918.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, I think my council is not understanding the free cash should be used now to fix a problem now, which we have, and I appreciate the clarification it's only $3 million accounts accounting and just said to fix the school budget, but the key issue isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2933.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: isn't the process of getting this fixed now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2936.745s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The problem that we've had, and we could use the pandemic and use the pandemic over and over again, but what neighboring communities are doing during the pandemic with the infrastructure money that was given through ARPA, that wasn't intended for, for the roads and sidewalks that you're asking for right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2951.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our mayor didn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2952.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our mayor had to balance our budget through ESSER and ARPA funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2957.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the easy way out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2958.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's like paying your mortgage with a credit card.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2961.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll tell you why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2962.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2963.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody hasn't said it, but the difference between why we're here and we're in trouble is because of new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2970.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: New growth is what pushes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2973.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: our value, our income up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2975.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It gives us more tax base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2977.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It brings more money so we can do all the things we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2980.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This mayor has done nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2982.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't had shovel in the ground in five and a half years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2985.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're talking about, I know my council friends have gone out and told people that Massachusetts is the number one, Medford is the number one community new growth in permitting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2995.47s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Wrong, I sat with the commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2997.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Permitting their fine, the biggest concerns we're having, look at the process that she lost fighting 40B projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3005.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One project alone was $3 to $5 million in permits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3010.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then an additional $7 to $9 million that would have come in as new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3015.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one job that she fought in court, lost and appealed it, and this group had to leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3021.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The problem isn't our tax base, because our assessments are up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3025.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're paying more than anybody else in neighboring communities because our assessments are so high.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3031.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will share my last point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3034.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Neighbor communities per child, Malden, Arlington, Winchester, between 15 and 17,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3042.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Medford, we pay $22,000 per student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3045.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it a management issue or is it really we don't have enough money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3049.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Think about it because it's public. $22,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3530.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I can, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3532.456s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3532.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, this financial task force was put together without any individual involved in that comment that a young lady put forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3542.981s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This was done in a bubble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3544.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This was done behind closed doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3546.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It wasn't planned to educate our seniors, educate our residents, educate our renters, educate our landlords, so they could prepare themselves for what's being asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3557.048s">[Scarpelli]</a>: within a vote that was presented, a discussion was presented on a Thursday, voted on a Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3564.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: not one community meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3565.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as a matter of fact, I will share this with everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3569.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was a FOIA request put out by a resident that asked a simple question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3575.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They asked for all of the information, minutes for the meetings, any information, letters, any emails, any text messages, with this financial task force, with any building or any entity within the city to figure out if this is needed or how it will be used and how it can work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3593.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 150 pages later, all the information that was in that FOIA request were information about when we can meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3600.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing that's solid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3602.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would also share with these parents that are so concerned about what's happening, we were<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3608.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: saw the information back from the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3612.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The school department communications director answered by saying, thank you for the FOIA request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3617.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We apologize for the tardy response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3620.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But after investigating, there was no school department employee or member of the school department involved in any financial task force<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3630.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: dealing with these overrides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3631.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what again, what we're saying is we don't know if an override is needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3636.331s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know one thing, we know we could fix this issue right now with free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3641.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So our students and teachers and families are fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3644.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we go back to the drawing board as a community together to see what we really need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3650.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If the mayor isn't gonna put new growth out there, she's not gonna work to bring in creatively, bring in funding for the city, then maybe we can look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4026.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Financial director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4203.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure, let me help you, Mr. Jones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4206.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This financial task force was a farce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4208.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was a lack of transparency throughout.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4211.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you speak on, I speak to this in where I worked in 2009.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4216.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we met in a possible override in a neighboring community, we talked about three things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4221.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was how do we get here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4223.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What do we do to fix it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4224.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And how does this happen again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4226.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And those people brought in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4228.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: mines from Tufts, Harvard, MIT, Medford, not one person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4233.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They brought in their financial team, Medford, not one person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4237.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They had their assessor set the rate so people can understand, assessor was never involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4241.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you look at how this was done, this was done in a bubble, this was presented on a Thursday, and then voted for in the budget meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4249.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you look at the budget meetings, when I brought up the way to fix it, which is free cash, and I'll disagree with my fellow counselor, because she's wrong 1,000%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4261.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Free cash for divisional local services, it's not recommended, but not against the law to use free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4269.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 3 to 5% annual budget, FY24 method generated $9 million to add to a $25 million estimate, which means the city had around 16% of free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4281.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, the solution was very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4284.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's have this financial task force present this to the community, because that's what I asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4289.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I asked my colleagues, when are we going to present what the findings were?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4293.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were no findings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4294.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was just given, we're going to do an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4296.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People came up, shared, the mayor was happy, and it was done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4299.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The truth of the matter is, you're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4302.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was no one involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4304.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This was done in a bubble to scare people, to come out and say, the schools, the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4310.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll say it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4311.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said this in April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4312.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said it in May.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4312.714s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll say it today again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4314.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We might need an override, but if we do it right, with open and transparent government, we could do something great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4321.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now remember, with one override in every other community, there's two, three to follow, and don't forget, this council's gonna ask for a 200 to $400 million debt exclusion from New High School, which we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4332.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4334.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please don't be confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4336.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not telling you the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4337.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4339.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4854.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Another fair tactic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4855.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So people should understand the mayor came out just the other day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4858.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had 34 million, 34.5 million as of July 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4863.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor, just so you know, what free cash is, it's your money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4866.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we say we're going to fund 50 teachers and we don't pay those 50 teachers because they don't hire them, that money goes into free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4875.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's our money, that's your tax money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4877.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and then it could be used for what it needs to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4879.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's truly mismanagement of funds from our leadership team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4884.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's taking what we sign off on our budget and not use correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4889.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what we have right now, I believe I've said this, Councilor Lemming said it over and over again, I'm not saying use free cash every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4897.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a deficit right now, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4900.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we can correct right now and not put the schools and kids and teachers in fear and say let's level fund that budget using one time free cash one time and then look into what options we have later but let's listen to the mayor what she said 34.5 million<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4916.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now she knows the override's gonna be a fight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4918.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What does she do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4919.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Boom, she starts putting all these different monies in different accounts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4923.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So from her words exactly in her video the other day, we have 18.5 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4928.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With that said, we can still take funding to level the school budget and still have 14, $15 million, which still leaves enough in there that would appease any bond rating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4940.553s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, let's not get scared because that's a scare tactic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4944.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's see the bond rating so we can move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4946.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, when we look at this situation, council, different communities, free cash, Arlington is 18 million, Framingham 14 million, bigger budget, Quincy 1.2 million, bigger budget, Andover 14 million, Newton, these communities are bigger than ours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4964.739s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have this budget, they function with lower funding and free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4971.183s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So understand this, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4972.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can do this one-time cost to save the fare from our schools, take care of our seniors, our renters, our homeowners, so we can stop the fare in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4982.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please, vote no on these overrides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4987.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was done in a bubble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4988.613s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It wasn't transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5219.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's 18.5 left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5226.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's called scare tactics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5438.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, Mr. Giglio, these are all scare tactics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5443.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, the financial task force didn't have the FOIA requests that shows that there were no documentations, no minutes, no information given.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5453.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We heard the assessor, we know all the major parties, the school department, the assessor, the finance director, weren't involved in these issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5462.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is, it's not a lie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5464.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just said it, you heard it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5466.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Put 30 seconds back on for interrupting me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5468.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have the understanding that the sky is falling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5474.177s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All of these projects that we need to fix, we need to fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5477.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In normal communities, what we do is we bond these projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5481.079s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we look at situations that we talked about earlier, when it's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5486.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're trying, what we're seeing here right now, Mr. Joyo, it's the underfunding of local revenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5496.209s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One second, I'll just, it's the focus of what we're seeing that our community has done for years here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5502.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's show lower meals tax and hotel tax and excise tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5507.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So then when it comes higher, you can put that and use it for whatever you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5511.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let that be known, the understanding what you're asking for, there are no numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5515.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The problem we hear right now, why the city's divided, why our seniors are scared, why our landlords are scared, why our homeowners and renters are afraid right now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5523.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why our students and parents and teachers are afraid is because this group did something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5529.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They put it out there without any true information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5531.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we don't know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5533.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't been educated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5534.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why there's so much fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5536.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The firefighters aren't supporting a $30 million fire station, because again, there was no transparency there when it came to the final decision that had to be made for 30.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5544.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they've decided to go public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5546.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They decided to go public to say, let's not hurt our taxpayers with whatever, how many it's going to be, because we don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5553.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It could be a $50 million fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5555.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the design was never put forth to the firefighters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5559.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you say totality, six, seven, and eight, we haven't been involved, Mr. Gileo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5564.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are no numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5565.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There is no information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5566.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because this group did it in the financial task force that presented it on a Thursday, voted on it on a Tuesday, and then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5574.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We find $9 million in free cash after that, that the man knew was certified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5583.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, can I say one more thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5685.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We wouldn't know that because it's literally in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6037.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With the fair tactics, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6038.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the schools, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6041.33s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's Councilor Lemming said it over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6044.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, we haven't done it, so let's do it, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6047.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just because we haven't done it, let's do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6049.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now the roads, now we hear the schools were built bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6054.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's all fair, this is all fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6056.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But here's the thing, we're not saying that, let's not look at this properly and do it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6064.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6065.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're doing it in a bubble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6067.051s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're doing it so privately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6068.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're doing it where it's gonna hurt so many people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6072.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, the finger-pointing between teachers and finger-pointing between seniors and kids, and it's a shame what you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6082.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can correct this right now with the free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6085.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No matter what they say, the truth of the matter is we have free cash to make sure that seven and eight are correctable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6092.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know question six is correctable by listening to our firefighters, who will tell you straightforward that the mayor's not telling the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6102.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What they're building there is insufficient, and it's going to put us 30 years behind in five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6108.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please understand this, Mr. Gervino, when you say all this information and how it gets out, we haven't done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6114.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even though councils want to say we did, we haven't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6117.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't prepared our seniors for what's going to happen on January 1st of 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6122.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Once the new assessment, once the new tax bills come out, we haven't done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6126.289s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't prepared up our, our, our landlords to how they're going to handle single parent, uh, renters in their home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6132.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't prepared our renters when increase goes up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6135.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here's another one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6136.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Somebody called me when I put a post out about a woman that called me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6140.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She has two children, and the landlord said, I'm not going to hit you with the assessment raise, but I'm going to be honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6147.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I got to tell you, I'm going to have to raise your rent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6151.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And someone asked me, well, are you going to support rent control?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6154.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, there's another wrong that doesn't make a right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6157.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, there's a system in place with this group that's telling you what you should do out of fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6163.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please, again, we have the funds to fix it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6167.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No matter what they're saying, it's absolutely above board to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6172.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand it was done with mismanagement throughout the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6177.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6514.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6524.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It goes into general fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6527.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6528.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It goes into general fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6529.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And by law, you're supposed to take the letter of what the questions are and use those funding as closely as you can to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6538.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the questions as they're read are very vague.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6542.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it really doesn't mean it's gonna go directly to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6546.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It could be portions of that or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6548.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I'll bring us back to the budget meeting when school committee member Jenny Graham was asked a question, if we were given $5 million, would everybody go back to those positions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6559.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the answer was yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6561.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The next evening, the school's financial director and the school superintendent, when I asked that question from the evening before, she said, absolutely not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6571.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The money would go back into their fund and they would distribute it to what they think is best for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6577.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's a little, it's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6580.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll give you an example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6581.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talk about all these different cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6583.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't filled, I believe now 29 teachers in the Medford public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6589.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's funding we haven't, we paid for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6591.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have so many dire issues, so many, the fiscal crisis we've been hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6597.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same breath, we're asking to bring in shiny new programs that are new, that are costing the school department $200,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6606.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're talking about a city council that during this financial crisis talked about, did what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6612.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We found $9 million of free cash when they looked at the override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6616.035s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6617.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They voted themselves a raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6619.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the SIKU committee now goes from $10,000 to $12,000 up to $22,000, $24,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6626.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor gets an increase three times, three different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6630.436s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I implore all of you who are open-minded thinkers, are you sure we're in a fiscal crisis or are we in a problem with this fiscal mismanagement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6726.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6951.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Councilor Bielsa, in question six, I think we have a firefighters union here that have been involved in the negotiation because there is no limit on question six, truly is no limit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6962.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6964.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, there isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6965.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's wide open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6965.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that if we can maybe have a fire fighters that have been working on this, just to give us an idea of what the process was, the beginning, what we were looking at for a number and how, how much it's dropped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6978.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can understand truly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6984.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6985.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm sorry, hopefully the firefighters can have an opportunity to express why they want to vote no on this debt exclusion because I think what you asked, there is such fluctuation and what's true, what they needed and what was agreed upon<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7003.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: before the mayor became very angry with the firefighters and then started cutting and cutting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7008.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now we're left with an inferior product that our firemen and women, firefighter men and women said over and over again, that please do not hurt the residents of this community with an inferior station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7020.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Don't do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7021.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Wait, maybe down the line, we could rethink this and refocus on what we could do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7025.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But for now, we're saying, let's not hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7028.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So here we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7028.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have teachers that are saying, let's not hurt our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7031.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have firefighters saying, let's not hurt the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7034.929s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The questions you're asking should have been out there for you, Joan, months and months ago, so you could truly understand the impact that you're going to feel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7043.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, this is where we talk about the lack of transparency and why this should be taken off the table and people should vote no, because the bottom line is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7053.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The fear of children, that should be fixed with the $3 million from free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7057.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor said it, we have 18.5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7059.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We could still take 3 million out and do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7061.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll still have enough to keep our bond rating up and look to bond other projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7066.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or maybe we sit together again as a true financial working group, a task force, and say, how do we do this together as a community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7074.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're not gonna look later because there's no guarantees that there won't be another override next year, I promise you that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7080.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because every other community that's gone that way have asked for two and three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7626.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7629.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Isn't this a total microcosm of what we're saying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7633.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what 678 is about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7635.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's so much confusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7638.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First of all, we have to understand the feasibility study that was done is what gets us the funding for through procurement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7645.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we know the numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7647.11s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When my fellow council said that this is a city building and firefighters, I don't know what the comment was, that is so irresponsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7654.437s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To understand that this fire department's gonna stand up and say, no, we don't want a new headquarters because it's insufficient and it will hurt our community funding-wise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7665.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we say the needs of the community, we mean proper safe staffing and department and ability to add technical rescue specialist services to our emergency response, which will bring better services to the citizens in every call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7678.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's wrong what they're asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7679.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're asking for a fire stations adequate to help our community grow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7685.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The proposed design does not adequately address the health and safety issues of the fire service regarding cancer exposure mitigations, the privacy concerns which have never been addressed properly by our department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7697.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Adults deserve privacy regardless of the gender.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7700.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't an issue which is female and men.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7703.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you understand the design that was presented has firefighters after a fire showering downstairs<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7709.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: walking upstairs in a towel or a bathrobe, walking down a community hallway to get to their quarters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7716.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: By the way, their quarters did not consist of a locker room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7721.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what we're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7722.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are issues that I can't even believe that we would entertain this with so many questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7728.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is how six, seven, and eight were all done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7730.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They were all done in a bubble that we're supposedly battled over on social media by a leader of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7739.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have the former fire chief here, we have the leaders of our fire department that have openly said, we don't want to hurt our citizenry and putting $30 million, let alone $3 into this because we don't know what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8151.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate my fellow counselor being in my mind to understand what my plan was, was to get the superintendent to say something she didn't wanna say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8162.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I appreciate the resident who put all of the meetings out on social media because you could say whatever you want about George Scott Pelley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8174.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You could say that he's a liar, but when there are video and documentations with it, simple question to the superintendent was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8182.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Will this money, will it be made whole like Councilor, School Committee Woman Graham mentioned?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8187.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Her simple answer was no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8189.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wasn't trying to have her say anything any different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8191.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as a matter of fact, what we're seeing in the school system after that vote, there were many teachers and many programs that were dismissed and cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8200.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had the band leader who left right away because there were promised things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8204.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had, we had to believe a $200,000 line put in place for City Year, which is a great program,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8210.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a great program, but when you have so many fiscal crises in the city, why are we funding something that's just a shiny nickel right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8217.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many issues with this, my friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8220.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I implore you just to listen to the common sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8224.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Listen to the understanding that you can use free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8227.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a former teacher, and a parent of public school kids, and a coach, I understand, I lived it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8235.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I lived the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8237.981s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but I also understand and how to move forward without hurting our whole community or without dividing our whole community, because this is what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8247.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These override questions are hurting our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8250.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have the information that's out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8253.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not spelled out correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8255.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't truly know, although like Councilor Kelly had said, yeah, it goes to the general fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8260.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know where that money's going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8263.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have teachers positions open with money in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8265.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Remember, there's a lot of money that hasn't been used to date that we can still use, but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8537.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, we went over this again, just to reiterate to people that are new to the room, $37, that's all it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8544.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Coming from people that truly don't understand the impact, because a lot of people here, imagine just $37 a month, what that would do to people sitting in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8552.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Imagine the impact, because that's been overlooked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8555.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but it's not 37.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8556.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about the CPA increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8558.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about the assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8560.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about the excise tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8562.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8563.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not 37.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8563.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The dialogue of fear spins it easily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8567.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, again, I'm gonna say this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8569.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The dialogue of fear, we talked about busing now, lead in the water, teacher cuts, roads and sidewalks, because $500,000 is gonna fix road and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8580.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the most important thing I wanna talk about is what's happening in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8584.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if you watch what's happening in social media, the teachers union, the MTA, has never ever, as one person that was on the negotiating team and a former member, has never ever<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8599.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: ruled on or endorsed a candidate or a question, because we knew as union members that our impact's not gonna hurt just, it's not gonna help us, but it's gonna hurt other unions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8611.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they did the right thing by staying neutral.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8616.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And maybe they believe in it, maybe they don't, but they said, let's be, let's stay neutral.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8620.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And shame on this community that have turned their backs on teachers saying, the comments I've been seeing, like this is the teacher's fault?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8628.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't the teacher's fault, this is the administration's fault to set up this fear tactic and set up this negativity to divide us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8636.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's dividing our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8639.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Listen, I want everything we can get for our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8642.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want everything we need for our students and parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8646.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want everything we need for our firefighters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8649.52s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there's options with new growth as we come down the line, but we can correct it right now without hurting renters, landlords, senior citizens, our people that are most vulnerable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8659.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can use that free cash, make it whole and move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8665.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I implore you, please, think about what you've been hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8669.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's concrete, common sense information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8672.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9184.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, Councilor, to clarify a little something, I think that what I've heard from residents is the chronic misrepresentation and the lack of true transparency<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9198.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is what causes the community to distrust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9203.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what we're seeing right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9205.304s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's truly what we're seeing right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9207.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you hear and see how we got to this point, this is what caused it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9214.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The misinformation, the confusion, the uncertainty for the people that are most vulnerable, our children, our seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9226.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the issue that we should be focusing on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9229.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and thinking that an override is the answer, or, ready for this one, $500,000 are gonna fix our streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9237.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Come on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9239.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So let's look at, now I've heard that 20 times tonight, that $500,000 is gonna fix our streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9244.514s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's look at the big picture of what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9246.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: DPW, the mayor is firing DPW workers hand over fist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9252.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have equipment at DPW that we have members that haven't been trained because they don't know how to be trained on new equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9261.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a mayor that's spending so much money on legal fees and legal settlements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9269.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're using, the mismanagement of funds in this community has hurt us to the point that here we are, that some council is saying, hey, since we haven't done it ever, let's do it, which is wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9283.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I'd love to see us do this the right way from the schools with free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9290.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's go to the table and see what we truly need with a true financial team open to the public that it's shared with everybody's input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9299.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9456.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't understand her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9457.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't hear her question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9466.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, it's very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9467.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll say it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9468.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that when we sat and talked at the meeting in April, May, and June, I came forth with the proposal of a resolution of using free cash of the $25 million that we had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9483.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe it was Councilor, when I brought it forth, it was Councilor Lemming that used Rule 21, which froze<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9491.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the future discussions of that proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9494.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then as it went through and you could see in the videos, as we went through that process, they kept using tactics where we couldn't speak or have open forums before we went to a vote in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9506.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, these are issues that when I say<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9511.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what we need to eliminate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9512.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to sit together as a community and say, okay, what do we work with the state and work with our assessor and say, hey, let's understand the impact at an early enough stage so we can be prepared for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9524.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's see if we can look at true exemptions that would help our landlords or senior citizens<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9529.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or our most vulnerable community members, then let's look at it and say, what do we really need and make sure that our children in our schools have everything that they're asking for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9539.373s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that with that process being open, I don't think we wouldn't be able to deny anything, but the way the process has come out and the way that's been spun saying, Councilor Scott Pelling wants no because he doesn't want that, that's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9555.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The truth of the matter is the way this process has gone about from 2023 in June till today has been a total farce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9563.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's been a nightmare.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9564.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's been disingenuine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9566.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this council can say what they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9568.839s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These fair tactics are out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9570.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've heard them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9571.52s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not making it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9572.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've heard them all say it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9574.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: whether it's whether it's whether it's streets falling in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9578.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, even the mayor said the other day was sitting on a 200 million dollar time bomb called our water system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9584.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9585.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, if we did our job with ARPA, that's what that money was made for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9590.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not to save your key, sir, because you had no new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9593.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10069.855s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let me say it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10070.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10071.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This councilor has not said once that we should use free cash year after year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10076.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I said right now is eliminate the fear for our senior citizens, our children, our teachers for one time to level fund this and look at other options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10087.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what I said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10087.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know where this keeps coming back and forth and understand an override<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10094.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was said by another financial director in another community, he said to me, George, remember, using an override to do what you're trying to do in Medford, it's like using your credit card to pay for your mortgage or pay for your rent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10105.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's just not feasible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10107.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not a right way to go through the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10109.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We look at the different situations that we talk about and we said, okay, you know, Medford has drastically underfunded so many processes when you look at our receipts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10122.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're seeing that right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10123.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We see that our circuit breaker has increased.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10128.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've seen that we use the Fair Amendment Act for Chapter 70, our increase of $4 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10136.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There is a lot that's out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10138.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a lot of money in the city that we're not using correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10144.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have seen it over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10145.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've talked about, just to have the fact that you have $9 million of free cash at the end of the year, your budget season, to get certified, that just speaks volumes of mismanagement of fiscal funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10159.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Remember, when you sit there and you set that budget, that budget is set, let's say 100 million, and then you only spend 90 million, that means you didn't do something right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10173.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That means you didn't use that money appropriately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10176.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the city's taxpayers' money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10180.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when I say free cash, of course it's not free.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10183.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's our money that we've already paid the year before to balance our budget, to make our city run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10226.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Simon, thank you for coming up tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10229.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm so impressed with you coming to this podium, because there are so many scaredy cat adults, but you have the guts to come up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10235.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I applaud you for that, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10237.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I have family members that might be your teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10241.575s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have children that went through the schools just like you did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10245.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know it's scary right now, because you're listening to grownups talk about, we're gonna cut positions, we're gonna hurt teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10252.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not the intent, my friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10254.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a solution that's easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10257.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can use money that the city has saved, that can fix it right now, instead of going to a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10263.096s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's something that Mr. Scott Pelley asked for years, months and months ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10267.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when you come to this point, my friend, you have to understand, we wanna make sure that every single one of your teachers are back next year, because you know why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10276.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You deserve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10278.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for coming up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10950.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10952.01s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To your point, Mr. Rodriguez, I think that this is why question eight, again, this is why these questions are so vague, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10959.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That people are confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10960.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because the determination of this $4 million is so we can align the vocational school building with the high school building so we can increase the day, so we can provide programming for both levels, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10974.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So here's something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10977.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It hasn't been negotiated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10978.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It hasn't been discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10980.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So where is the money gonna go when it's not even entertained?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10986.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are the questions people have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10988.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The question that's $4 million, the state expert and former superintendent of Medford, Roy Belson, stated, if during negotiations, that's what we're looking for is to line those bells, then it's negotiations for the high school and vocational school teachers to increase their rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11013.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Realistically, you're looking at $600,000 when you're looking to do that group, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11018.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $4 million for what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11021.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like we've said, more arts programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11024.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have art programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11026.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The issue is aligning the bell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11028.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In programming, we have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11029.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just gotta line the bell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11032.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, it's so wide open to say $4 million to do arts and to align this process with the vocational school and the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11042.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is so vague, how can we even entertain voting on it when we know the ramifications to the rest of the community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11051.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11055.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: hear what was being said tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11057.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many open-ended questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11059.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many issues that people don't know how we got here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11063.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have FOIA requests that show that there was no proper discussions with school department members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11069.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When the school department isn't part of this financial task force for an override, and then a question like question eight comes up, it's so vague.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11077.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we sure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11078.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we sure that we need an override?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11184.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Where does it say that though?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11185.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because that's eloquent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11187.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You would have to look at it if it was presented that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11190.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, it wasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11191.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11192.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11737.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11741.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11743.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I missed most of the question, Bill, but again, like we're saying, we're hearing a systemic issue that's been happening for years, but the way the process, and I'll say again, the way the process has come forth, the way the process has come full circle right now, it's putting so many people, so many residents in flux and fear, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11765.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's the biggest concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11767.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the way that we've moved forward, that this group has moved forward to present an out, that really isn't an out like they've said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11776.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not gonna really help, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11779.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know where the money's going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11780.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Things are still questioned for each question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11783.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not certainties, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11786.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've already heard from everybody that hasn't been part of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11790.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, why continue this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11794.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why keep moving forward and understanding that we're hurting real people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11797.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're hurting real residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11800.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I said, I like, again, I'm talking about the children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11803.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm talking about the seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11804.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm talking about our renters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11805.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm talking about our homeowners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11807.692s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're hurting a lot of people right now for something that quote unquote is so minimal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11814.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the truth of the matter is, this is so minimal and such cause such divide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11819.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're now seeing is, are we truly gonna look at the next question when we really need it properly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11825.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or are we gonna look at it with caution and saying, I'm definitely gonna stand against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11833.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll use a $200 million, $400 million high school down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11838.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Imagine if that process was done, how it would destroy homeowners right now, senior citizens, people on fixed incomes, it would destroy us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11847.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why this process has to be done in a better way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11849.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It shouldn't be done in a vacuum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11852.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11926.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I think if I can, Mr. President, I think when we've heard parents of the fear, right, that we're going to cut, I believe one school can remember saying it was 55 to 65 teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11938.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then it was now 35 and the pain, the fear is going to be spread all over, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11945.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody's going to feel the pain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11947.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was the comment that's gone out publicly by that school can remember.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11950.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11951.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think what you're saying to this is saying that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11955.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we gonna cut, a teacher's gonna be cut in January, January 2025, if the override fails in November?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11963.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a question, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11964.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11966.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know because in these questions, these override questions, you didn't say to cover the cost of 55 to 65 teachers that will be cut, not a question seven or question eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11977.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11979.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that again leads to another example of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11985.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we sure we know what we're voting on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11987.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And are we sure we need to move forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11991.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And was this transparent enough?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12003.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So clarity, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12004.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So clarity, everyone, where's Simon?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12007.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Your teachers aren't going to be cut this year, because that's the word going out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12011.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The word was at these meetings now, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12013.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They will not be cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12013.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There'll be no cuts until next fiscal year, next school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12017.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But next fiscal year, we'll have more money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12018.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Next school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12019.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12020.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It'll give us time, because we had an opportunity, Gaston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12023.539s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had an opportunity back in 2023, when we realized that we were using ARPA and ESSER funding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12031.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to balance a budget of operations which you shouldn't that we know that but this council voted on a backroom deal that that's what happened and then they've moved forward with this financial task force so here we are right now that was only 1.7 right only 1.7 so all right so this is where we are right now i'd like to not go back and forth guys oh i apologize so this is thank you i apologize thank you um go to vice president collins two minutes thank you and guess on i realize i may have misunderstood your question um with what fiscal year you were talking about but i know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12716.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12717.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First, let's start off by the teachers and compensation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12720.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A good way to make sure they go is scare them with layoffs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12726.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when you have an avenue to save them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12729.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But with this question, the truth of the matter is, in most communities, it's growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12734.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Growth, growth, growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12736.096s">[Scarpelli]</a>: New growth, smart development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12737.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12739.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what happened in neighboring communities like Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12741.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: During the pandemic, what happened in Everett, what happened in Malden, you saw new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12747.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've heard my council colleagues say that it'll take us five to seven years to see that wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12751.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had three 40B projects that not only would bring in valuable funding through permits and fees, and then the new tax base, but also open up an opportunity for what we lack here is affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12768.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this mayor has voided that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12770.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So like I said, just one project, and I'll say it over and over again, because we've talked to the owner of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12776.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He put in a place for 40B projects, 400 units at the old gold gym site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12781.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $3 to $5 million just in permits would have come right to us, right away, $3 to $5 million for one project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12787.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then you would see an increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12789.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Once that's built, you would then have a tax base of more to $6 to $9 million coming in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12797.115s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now what you saw is the mayor fight that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12800.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: which is a 40B project, which you can't fight and win in court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12803.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know that by law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12804.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She takes it to court, they lost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12806.169s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then she brings it back and she appeals it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12810.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: While we're paying lawyers, we lose the appeal, but at the same time, we now have these developers that have walked away to Medford because now they're in Watertown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12819.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now they're in other neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12821.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this gentleman just lost $5 million by sitting on a property, hoping he could develop Medford the right way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12827.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The other piece we have right now, the mayor is, did everybody hear this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12830.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's an RFP for five spots in Method Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12834.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What's the plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12836.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12837.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is again, lack of transparency and openness in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12840.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13095.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, if I can, I think there's more involved here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13101.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that it's very clear and cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13103.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the communities can see that our firemen and women do not want this override or this debt exclusion because it hurts our citizenry because the design and the building that they're looking to build is not adequate for any of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13117.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We also have a firefighter standing in front of us that, so we all understand why we're in fiscal crisis, why we're in fiscal issues, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13127.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Firefighter Masolino wrote a grant for 11 firefighters<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13131.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: through FEMA, so the FEMA would pay these 11 firefighters for three years, as long as you didn't vary from those 11 firefighters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13142.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor came in and said, at the end, the only caveat is you have to sustain those 11 firefighters to be at minimal level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13150.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor came in and said, no, we'll only fund five or seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13154.247s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just by doing that, guess what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13156.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It voided the 11 firefighters that would have been paid for FEMA for three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13162.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, this council, the mayor had a outside member doing evaluation to come in, and we spent $10,000 to start with this firefighter evaluator to come in and look at the fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13177.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have yet to hear anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13179.272s">[Scarpelli]</a>: From what I hear, that person's been gone now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13181.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No report, no nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13183.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the problem we see, the mismanagement of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13186.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not that we don't have, in certain cases, enough funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13190.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's how you manage those funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13192.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I thank you for everything you do, and we should not vote support this override, because our firefighters are saying, let's not hurt our residents, especially if it's an inferior product.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13206.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll stay where we are, even though it's disgusting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13210.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14012.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, and I appreciate the question because I too have a stance on this and it's difficult when your kids are reading posts and saying, hey dad, why are they using you for supporting constituents and residents that feel like they're being not listened to, to racist or a member of KKK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14034.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's pretty sad, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14036.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you see these situations of division,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14039.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's because people feel they haven't been heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14043.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I welcome you to look at the videos from our meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14046.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had viable questions in our meetings, and this is where the division started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14050.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you try to bring these questions forward and this council actively shut you down, as a member of this community and a city councilor, to be disrespected like that, opened up so many people's eyes to say, is this something that's been, is it needed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14067.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because there's a group of people, my friend, that aren't being heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14071.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're afraid that no one's listening to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14075.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something that could be corrected, I've said this a thousand times, I never said I didn't want a debt exclusion, or the side, even the All-Method group saying that they didn't want a debt exclusion, all they're saying is, let's have a more open and transparent process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14087.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've heard so many questionable issues tonight, from the firefighters' designs, to question seven and eight, there's so many.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14094.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think the problem right now is you have six councils that really look at something and an issue and they band together, but they leave a whole demographic out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14102.917s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They can say the fluffy words to say that, well, it's divisive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14106.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're saying it's divisive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14107.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Words that some people use is divisive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14109.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The bottom line is if it's smell, if it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck, it's a duck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14114.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and people just watch and see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14116.705s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want division either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14118.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's too much division in this whole country, in this whole world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14121.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would love for us to sit together, but as a councilor, when you're trying to share an opinion for a group of constituents that feel that they're not being listened to, that they feel like they're not being listened to, then you bring that forward, and then they actively shut you down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14137.651s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They use council rules against you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14139.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They suspend council rules so you can't speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14142.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14144.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is why the division started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14146.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because people didn't feel like they were properly listened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14149.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They didn't feel like this financial task force was actually transparent and open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14152.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if they were, and the mayor presented all the facts, maybe we'd be in a different place right now, but we're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14160.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we made a lot of mistakes on many sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14989.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that when you left, no one could say this publicly, but we wanna thank you because we know how difficult your job is anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14995.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We understand becoming a chief is very difficult because you have been thrown into the realm of politics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15001.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's sad because I know who you are as a man and I know how much you love being a firefighter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15006.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'll be honest with you, I was sad to hear that you did step away because Medford is worse as a fire department because you're gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15014.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I wanna make sure publicly somebody said that to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15016.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know Danielle doesn't want to say it, but I've heard it over and over again through public, through social media, our leader of the community, through social media, bashing on you, bashing on other fire chiefs, saying it's all them, that they've been part of the design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15032.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I need to know, when you left, were our firefighters involved in that design that we have today?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15340.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15341.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, if I can, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15346.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Clarification, thank you with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15347.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I also know that from what I've heard, it's 1,000 square feet smaller.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15352.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think you want to talk about unity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15354.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You want to talk about doing something correct as a team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15356.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you're talking about firefighters, that their safety with carcinogens aren't being met, I think in unity, we should all say that we do not support this debt exclusion for a fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15367.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's inadequate for our men and women in the fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15370.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what I think we should say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15372.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You want to start in that process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15374.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15375.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But Chief, thank you so much for the clarity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15377.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I apologize that our firefighters aren't being heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16519.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if I can, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16521.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So very simply put is, I've been saying this for months now, is that it's a one-time correction with the free cash to eliminate any fear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16532.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and disruption to our whole community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16536.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been saying for years that in the last five years, we've had zero new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16542.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you talk about new growth, that is the solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16546.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The solution to any community's investment in finances is their new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16552.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done nothing in the city of Medford to hang our hats on other than a beer hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16560.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't seen anything bring in true funding other than a beer haul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16566.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, I mean, I've been pretty consistent with what I've been saying, but although you don't wanna look at transparency, I think that's the major issue right now is because the word, the information is not getting out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16579.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're voting on something that we've shown so many different reasons why we shouldn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16585.088s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many open questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16586.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many people, actual people that are gonna get hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16591.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that to have a solution is very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16593.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's using free cash once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16596.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People keep saying that I'm saying that we do this all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16600.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We do this once because this community had over $35 million, over $34 million of free cash that we could have used and then sat together in an open process to see what we can do together as a total community to see what we needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16619.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16620.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, new growth and development is so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16625.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We look at the way that our budget was underfunded in certain aspects, but underappreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16633.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we have to look at so many different options in the future, but what we lacked and the reason why we're here is because our mayor and our administration use one-time funding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16647.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to carry her water for the last five and a half years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16652.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why we are where we are.<br><br>
