    <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=21.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=467.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4821.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I thank fellow Councilor John Falco for bringing that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4825.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can amend that, if we can maybe add the digital speed monitor, maybe to slow people down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4835.507s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Also, I know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4837.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, we've worked both Councilor Falco and Councilor Kern have been working with Sergeant Hartnett on the traffic issues as that's a major cut through, especially with the future work that's being done up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4851.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that might be something we need to rekindle for another subcommittee meeting with the hospital site and then bring Officer Hartnett.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4860.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know they did a report, a traffic study that counted the cars that went through that area and it was pretty<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4867.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was pretty astronomical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4869.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think if we could put that, the, the machine there, if we can ask the chief to put that up there so people can see the speed limit and maybe that could deter some of the speeding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4881.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But thank you again for this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=4884.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7073.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7074.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7075.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, again, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7076.661s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, my fellow councilors bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7078.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that just to shed some light, this is one of the, uh, first meetings we had with, uh, the recreation focus group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7085.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about, um, facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7088.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one thing we did talk about and have met with the mayor's office is that, uh, a dual function, whether it's recreation, whether it's the art council or, um, or S or such other,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7100.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, facility, but I know that they've had, um, the building inspectors in there and for the sole purpose to see what we can do for housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7110.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, such very important, uh, um, initiatives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7115.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that they've, they've been doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7117.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I too, if we can call for that committee of the whole meeting and, and get an update because I, you know, the, uh, the activity that was there could have been, uh, the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7129.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the builders that were looking in to see what needed to be done there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7133.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Obviously we know the police have been there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7134.821s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, I know that the mayor's office has been actively, uh, searching and working with that site to see what's best for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7143.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm pretty excited about the possibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7145.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for your input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=7147.209s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1037.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1039.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1352.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1358.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1359.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Your name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1373.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We did discuss that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1374.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's part of the 200 feet that we were told that Winthrop street will now have sidewalk throughout the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1381.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's national grid is going to take care of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1383.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not a national grid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1384.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe it was ever source.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1386.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was already set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1387.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1389.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we'll be, that'll be part of next week's meeting too, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1392.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can see this part of the MOU.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1394.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe it was in the MOU.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1395.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1396.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1396.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1397.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1400.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Anyone else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1580.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, for one, I know that this council has worked very hard with making sure that our, uh, our natural grid never source and other utilities do what they need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1592.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I find this disheartening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1594.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This will be the first time I'll see that, that announcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1596.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think this is something that we'll, we'll get on as soon as we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1600.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for coming out tonight and, uh, and sharing your opinions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1604.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1606.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, we have a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1608.541s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you have any other, anyone else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1609.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1610.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How's it going?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1927.779s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1929.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I think this is, we just had a Committee of the Whole meeting with the project being done with Eversource.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1936.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one of the biggest things we talked about is, as we move forward with that before we approve it, is having more of community input and making sure we have community meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1944.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I find this disheartening that this has happened again to this neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1948.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, I know that you have champions behind this rail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1951.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're going to make sure that we can do what we can right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=1954.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, uh, Mr. Vice president, if you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2149.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2149.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: On the motion, Vice President Mast, that we amend the paper that be forwarded, the mitigation, the Traffic Plan, and the Clerk of the Works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2163.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: neighbor communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2164.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's the four pieces I believe that we need to send to the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2169.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's amended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2171.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2171.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So second, uh, Councilor Knight, all in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2176.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All opposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2177.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The ayes have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2359.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2361.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I remember the resolution is very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2363.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Consumers appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2365.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're going to, on the motion, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo that this go to subcommittee on economics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2373.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Business and economic development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2374.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Business and economic development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2376.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2379.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2451.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2452.065s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe at the end of the meeting, Mr. Cassin, if you could give us the name of that company that we can actually, not publicly, but ask the weights and measures director, Mr. Champoli, to look into that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2463.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what his job is, to make sure those ones<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2473.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Leave a note.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2505.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They also do the oil trucks and all our cabs too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2508.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2510.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: On that, on that motion seconded by council dollar Russo to, uh, move this paper to subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2517.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: On economic development, all in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2519.379s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2520.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2521.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The ayes have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2522.221s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can go to unfinished business, uh, 17-571, um, to dispose of its common vehicular license, City Bazaar, 466 Main Street, City Council since July 18th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2538.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's been tabled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2539.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, they're not coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2541.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have the motion to, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2546.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to receive and place on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2548.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, on the motion to be seconded by Councilor Knight, all in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2552.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2553.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The ayes have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2601.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Next, records were passed to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2607.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who were they passed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2607.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2608.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I took them from Councilor Marksley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2610.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Records were stolen by Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2612.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were tabled records of meeting October 17th were passed to Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2617.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mungo Kern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2618.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's not here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2619.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Records of the meeting, October 31st, 2017.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2621.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll pass to vice president marks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2624.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How do you find those?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2628.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2629.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: On the motion table, those records all in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2632.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Opposed guys have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2634.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So motion motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2636.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Del Russo seconded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2639.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Falco all in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2642.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=618.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=619.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scott Billy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=620.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=622.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, Councilor Markswell, reiterating what, I don't want to be redundant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=628.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You brought up the same points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=630.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that in today's, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=637.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Studies have shown that we want more people off the street and out of cars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=641.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when we're prohibiting people or welcoming people to their nearest bus stop, I think that's exactly what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=649.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're limiting them from using public transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=652.02s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I second the resolve from Council Marks and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=658.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to put a timeline to that, that we get a response back within two weeks if we can, and if not, I want to send this to subcommittee and ask, I want to give it to the timeline, give it a few weeks, and then what I'd like to do if we don't have the proper response, I'd like to hold a subcommittee meeting with the representative from the T. If that doesn't, if we don't get,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=685.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: information back, because we know the lack of communications from the MBTA has been with this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=692.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that we need to hold their feet to the fire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=696.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when you talk about that one area, it's a dangerous area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=701.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to put a picnic bench out there, it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=708.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it's disheartening when you talk to some of those neighbors that see what might happen, uh, what goes on in that area and a negative note when, um, when there is, when they, when they are waiting in between buses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=722.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, I second the resolve from, uh, Councilor Marks and, um, amended, uh, well, to see if we can put that within two weeks if we can, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=736.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: an answer back within two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=738.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=738.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1394.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1396.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1397.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1398.459s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, my colleague, for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1400.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that months and months and months ago when we first were presented, I was one of the councils that voted against it because of the lack of information that went out to our constituencies, to our community, and with the opt-out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1418.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in discussions with neighbors, where neighbors that have been very conscious about purchasing their own energy and they're valid in understanding what the situation was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1432.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I did my homework in visiting a few communities, one of the biggest pluses were<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1440.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The plan that was put in place once it was passed by each community, and the plan that notified our residents about the value of this process and the option of opting out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1455.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So one other thing that I want to point out,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1458.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: question that came about was who would fund the notifications, all of the work that needed to be done to let all of our residents know about the opt-out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1469.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And with our last meeting and having the director from Melrose who came in and spoke so well on this issue, we answered a lot of questions that were brought to my attention that people had<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1483.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: asked me about and how would we find out who would pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1487.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, it all comes under the company that would be awarded this project if and when it happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1498.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my biggest concern wasn't the community aggregation plan because I think it's needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1508.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's something that every<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1513.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: constituent can use in bringing their electricity bill down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1517.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, not dramatically, but it does help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1520.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, the biggest piece was getting the notification out to our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1526.477s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I was pleasantly surprised and optimistic now in making sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1533.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When that plan is released to the public, it's going to be very thorough and with as much information and time needed for our residents to opt out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1546.805s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because again, one of the issues we often hear is a lack of notification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1551.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, with this plan, it falls back on the company that's awarded this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1558.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that in turn goes back out to our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1563.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate Councilor Longo-Curran for bringing this up, and I second her motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2789.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe we tabled it because they didn't they couldn't complete all the questions we had and they didn't get to to explain their whole Communication plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2802.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's a and then we're completing it next week So is there a way that we can get?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2809.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe the city engineer can give us some information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4531.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4532.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4533.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to be redundant, but I will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4537.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that the issues of having that master plan, I think it's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4544.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we wouldn't be true to this position if we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4549.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: weren't looking at the bigger picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4551.379s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the truth of the matter is, as one person put it, to hold this valuable historic piece hostage, in a sense, would be frightening to me if we would lose it over the winter because we didn't fund it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4568.609s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, we weren't part of those discussions years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4572.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think the plan that was put in place, and with the CPA that's now in front of us,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4579.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we talked about last week, using the Brooks Estates as a viable revenue source, I think it's something that, as someone that worked very hard on the recreation piece over the past few years, and talking to our friends from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4600.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the Brooks states and looking into different avenues that we can capture funding, I think it's a positive move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4607.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the thought of possibly losing the Carriage House to me is unacceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4612.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So one thing we did preach over the last few years is our support to our historical sites.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4621.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to, in my eyes, I feel that this Carriage House is one of the granddaddies of them all, so I'm going to support this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4630.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=75.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=76.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First of all, I'm talking to the chair of the subcommittee on zoning and ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=81.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that they've been drafting up a few of the ideas and presentations of what we're looking for moving forward with development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=91.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One of the biggest concerns that we hear now is the lack of housing and the lack of the type of housing that makes Medford the community that Medford is, which is housing for families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=103.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that looking into<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=106.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the rules and the policies that we need to jump in a little bit deeper in seeing what we're doing to make Medford continue to thrive as a community of families and looking to possibly increasing our affordable housing to what is acceptable in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=130.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we're still at, I believe, 10%, but I think it's something that needs to be looked at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=136.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Another piece that's alarming, you can see it in our community next door, they're having huge concerns with residents there that were accepted into the affordable housing units in different condominiums and now are being told by the developers that are there that they now need to move out because of the popularity of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=162.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: of selling those condos as individual units and they're being asked to leave and given a mere $1,000 just to move out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=169.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think it's important that before<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=172.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I shouldn't say this before, but it's hitting us now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=175.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we need to take a more active role moving forward and ensuring that what we're doing to protect our residents here in Medford with our added development and how we're looking at affordable housing is presented in a way that we hold the values of our families in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=195.115s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So with that, I appreciate the time, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=198.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=199.796s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=298.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=299.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=301.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This came about with conversations indirectly with the new director of recreation,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=309.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: members of the park board and members of our youth organization and also my background in working with facilities management and playing fields and knowing what we're doing in our community where I work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=324.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and preparing our playing fields.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=326.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One thing that we know that our DPW is drastically understaffed and I want to make sure that as the weather, if the weather continues the way it's going now, we might be playing at the beginning of March in a few weeks, hopefully so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=342.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we need our playing fields in a position where our children<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=348.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: can play in a safe environment and making sure that we're giving, making sure the city administration is preparing those fields and giving our DPW and parks department what they need to make sure that those fields are under, um, uh, supervised and make sure that they're, they're, they're, um, planned accordingly moving forward as we get closer to the season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=368.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=368.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=369.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Knife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=504.651s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a petition here this evening, if you can come on up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=516.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=524.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, Justin, the hours, it seems like the hours are gonna stay the same, and I know you provide a valuable resource to that neighborhood, especially to my son, so I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=538.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it seems like everything is in order, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=542.427s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I move to accept this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=546.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Dello Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=794.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=796.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President, Councilor Knight for bringing that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=800.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=801.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we're talking about such a serious situation, part of our discussion was the involvement of local politics and local municipalities to get involved, and really now pushing our state delegation to bring on to Washington what we think is something that needs to start at the local level, because we're seeing major<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=826.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: major catastrophic situations not being addressed by our brothers and sisters in Capitol Hill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=837.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that the President has made some moves today, but I think that we need to now start<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=845.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as a local government pushing our state delegation to making sure that they're presenting our views here in Medford that we can't stand for this type of violence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=856.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And say what you want about freedom of having guns, but there's a severe issue that's going on right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=867.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that the city of Medford should take ownership and start taking the lead that we can now push on to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=875.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: press legislation to change our gun laws in this country and making sure that the way people can purchase firearms are looked into in a more drastic, dire way because what happened this past week and what's happened for the last few years and so on,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=895.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It needs to stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=897.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It needs to stop today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=899.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we need to take an active role as local government that if our senior delegation is not taking that step, I think we need, as a voice of Metro, to now start pushing that along to our government, our delegation in Washington.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=918.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I hope that our, my colleagues,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=924.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: support that and move forward with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=926.541s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=927.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=928.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4731.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4733.18s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4734.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not going to... I won't be redundant what my colleagues have already issued, but I do have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4739.822s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we have parents that need to talk,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4742.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have to express my displeasure, Roy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4744.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that how hard you work as an educator, one of the greatest superintendent minds in education in the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4751.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think what we have with this situation is something that in many layers bothers me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4757.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a former school team member, we were adamant that notification was paramount to whatever situations moving forward at that time, and obviously that didn't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4768.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate you coming out and saying that you're taking responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4771.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate you saying that this isn't a forum for personnel matters, but I know as a parent, as a parent of two children in the Medford Public Schools, we need to see something happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4786.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There has to be something done, Roy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4788.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't something we're going to push to the side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4790.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something has to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4794.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I know we don't want to say it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4796.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't want to live in fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4798.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I personally think the opposite now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4800.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to live in fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4802.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are scary times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4803.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our kids are afraid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4804.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this would have been a great learning process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4807.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Imagine getting into a classroom and teaching the situation of bringing this type of dangerous ammunition and weapons into our schools and understanding how we could teach our children how important and how scary this is because it is scary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4823.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Society today is scary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4825.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's frightening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4826.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, I've talked to my kids about this just the other day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4829.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, Councilor Knight and I talked about this when I talked about our local government taking action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4833.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then this happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4836.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm so disappointed, so many different levels, because I'm going to beat the dead horse with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4843.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's bullets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4845.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's ammunition to a weapon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4848.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: of mass destruction, where kids have died just recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4851.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there is fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4852.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There is heightened fear in this room and at home with our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4858.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I need you to understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4860.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we don't want to be afraid and we don't want to, you know, we want to make sure that our kids feel safe in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4866.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I absolutely agree with you, and we do a great job in our school system making sure we feel that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4870.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But you know what, I think society has to realize, when things get done, it's out of fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4875.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is fear, this is necessity now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4877.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to have to start at this level, this is something that I'd have to put a huge black eye in what didn't happen in this role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4885.739s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This was bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4886.999s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This was bad in so many different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4888.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that I'm sick of just even discussing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4891.842s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But moving forward, I know the parents need to talk, but we have so many members in our community, our school community, that you work so hard to protect and making sure that our students with mental issues and are disabled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4907.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are our kids that are right in the front line of situations like this, that we need to get answers for to make sure they're protected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4914.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, again, as a former colleague of many of those teachers there who taught with them and went through the lockdown situations in that course, I can understand, but we need to do more with this situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4930.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to know that if it happens again, a bullet is enough, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4935.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A threat is enough that we have to let our children and our parents and our faculty know what's going on so we can prepare our children to make decisions what we think is right and safe for our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4946.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, again, believe me, I hate to be a heavy, but I tell you what, I am so sad and so disappointed that this wasn't presented in that fashion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4955.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know Dan Tully, he's a very thorough individual, and I'm sure he brought it to the attention that it was going to be reported.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4963.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and it wasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4964.437s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we need to, you need to move on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4967.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that the investigation is one thing, but as a leader of our school system that I, that I entrust with you, we need to make, we need to make some hard decisions tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4976.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Roy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4977.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=10011.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=10012.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, good job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=10013.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I apologize, I find the records in order to approve them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=10017.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=824.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=826.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, George Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=829.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 27 Butler Street, Matthew, Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=831.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, what I'm hearing on what we've seen today was horrific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=840.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I hear and see from this committee is just as bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=845.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't something that we're looking at systemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=848.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something right now that's happening right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=851.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our kids are afraid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=852.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My daughter doesn't want to go back to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=856.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Where is the urgency?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=859.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Where is your urgency?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=862.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A few weeks ago, we had parents up here talking about the fear they had about their daughter being beaten up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=869.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we had a consultant and I've asked teachers, I've asked students, have you seen the change?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=875.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing, nothing, nothing has been done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=883.78s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to sit back, I'm gonna speak and then I'm gonna leave because I don't want it back and forth, Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=891.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what we're seeing with my daughter, her friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=895.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I ran up to the high school just so I could be present for her, just so I could tell her her dad's outside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=905.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see over and over again, I saw Madam Superintendent, this is not an isolated incident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=911.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To write that this is an isolated incident and to say publicly this is an isolating incident is false.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=917.93s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=921.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=924.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm scared, and I'm disgusted, and I feel bad for my daughter and her friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=931.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this might be not the best thing a city council should do, coming up in front of a body and expressing themselves with this motion, but I don't care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=943.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have principals and assistant principals that are running around that school with no support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=951.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for rules that have been implemented by this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=955.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Give him back the tools, give them back the tools so they can run the school system the way they see fit to keep our kids safe, period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=965.079s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then look at your studies and then look at your consultants and see what they said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=975.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll be honest with tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=976.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've asked for an emergency meeting didn't didn't go through only three members voted for an emergency meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=982.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a forum for people don't feel like they've been heard today to be up for the city council tomorrow and express their concerns and I will be honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=990.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My daughter will not be going to school and her friends are not going to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1050.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1051.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will tell you, as a parent, you're asking me to have a back and forth?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1057.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a colleague, I haven't heard one word from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1060.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I haven't had one word from anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1062.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've publicly put this out there because we haven't heard one word from any of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1067.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, one word, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1069.52s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will tell you, as a former member of this body, I worked diligently to make sure that we implemented a plan to keep our children safe from bullies, not the opposite, because that's what we're feeling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1081.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what our kids are feeling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1083.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whether you want to see it or not, our children are telling us that they feel that you're protecting the bullies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1090.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're allowing them to run the show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1094.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you ask any kid, any child up there, they're telling me that they feel unsafe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1100.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're telling me that they don't have the structure that they felt in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1105.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to tell me that the tensions, suspensions, well guess what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1109.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you're saying that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1111.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's not happening, it's not getting to the ones that it's happening to, because the kids are saying that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1117.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The kids are telling me that there's no suspensions, that they're not gonna get detention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1123.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The kids are saying it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1126.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe so, but let me ask you one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1130.171s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've had assemblies for everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1132.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: After that incident with that young lady, did you bring that student body in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1136.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you bring that student body in and give them security to let them feel that they would be safe?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1141.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have any of you, other than Go Mustangs or emails to people that if they get to them or not, did you sit in front of the student body yourselves?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1151.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: After that incident, look them in the eye in the gymnasium, like you did when you were all there cheering them on for the football game, and look them in the eye and say, you're safe because of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1161.191s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're safe because we're going to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1163.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You did not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1167.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1169.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1169.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1173.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That doesn't have to be a law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1184.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We understand that, but that doesn't mean the tact and the professionalism that you have from your teachers and administrators up there to bring the rest of the student body in and to let them know that they're in a safe environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1198.261s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You don't have to disclose anything, any other news about what's legally can be said and what can't be said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1204.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're all educated, very bright people to sit our student body down and look them in the eye and say, you're okay and this is why it's gonna happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1212.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not asking you to disclose any information about the perpetrator, the person who was injured.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1219.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not saying that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1221.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let the kids know that they're safe, because you haven't done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1225.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You haven't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7455.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7473.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want to express that as a city Councilor, you will see resolutions from this Councilor that will ask you Madam Mayor, the resolution that if you came to our, our body for funding for licensed security guides to help our principals and assistant principals to make this happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7491.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That'll be a resolution, there'll be another resolution that the council would like to ask<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7496.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Members of the school committee, the police department, our teachers that we set up a team summit, so we can work with our children so they can tell us what they want, just like the brave young men and women that were here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7509.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that will be the dialogue that needs to be started, there'll be a few others, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7514.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As Mr. Puccio said earlier, we allow our parents to monitor lunches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7521.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We allow our parents to monitor different various programs throughout the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7527.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe it's time that we ask those parents, and myself included, that we get more involved on a daily basis at Medford High School so the kids see our faces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7537.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not to be the policemen, not to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7546.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: express this, the communication that I've gotten back from students and parents over the last 24 hours and before, is the understanding that we are very fortunate to have a headmaster like Paul DeLava.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7562.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Paul DeLava.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7566.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know Paul DeLava will be very upset because someone's talking kindly about him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7571.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But Paul DeLava was part of that group that when I was a school committee member, he was a coach, he was a teacher, he loves Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7580.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So whatever was implemented after that, whatever stigma that's out there that people are portraying what that administration can do or can't do, let's try to find a way to correct it and make sure we don't lose people like Paul DeLava and his staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7597.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if we lost him right now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7599.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we would be going back years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7601.945s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for your attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=360.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=474.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=475.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's my privilege tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=477.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we've had a tough week here in Medford, and this is fitting and needed to address a group of young people that have done our city proud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=493.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And before I recognize anyone, if Coach Curley and Coach Offit come on up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=515.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just called them up just because next to coach curly, I looked like a supermodel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=521.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, I wanted, I wanted to make sure he was next to me, but you guys, uh, I wanted to really put a resolution through a few weeks back to acknowledge, um, what the method Mustang football team has done and their coaching staff, something that's always, always overlooked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=543.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is the impact that young people play in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=547.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's easy when it's something bad, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=549.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When it's something bad, everybody wants to talk about what the kids are doing wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=554.221s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I wanted to make sure that as I look through different messages that I received, I was noticing a trend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=565.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was noticing an amazing trend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=570.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that our football team is a special, special group of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=575.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I coached at Medford High School for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=577.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was lucky to be part of a great organization and a great team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=583.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one thing I realized, it's very important to have Mustang pride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=588.922s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's what we're lacking right now in the city, true Mustang pride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=593.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when coach Curley came, came to the program and before that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=599.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had some difficulties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=600.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Numbers were low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=601.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Kids were getting in trouble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=603.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, we weren't winning games.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=606.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody thought that the world was ending.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=608.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then you saw the bigger picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=610.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Coach Curly came in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=613.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You saw him active in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=616.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You saw him doing special things with his, his team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=619.945s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And all of a sudden the football team started becoming, became elevated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=625.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now the numbers have grown and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=629.264s">[Scarpelli]</a>: positive things are in front of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=633.407s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=634.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's my favorite song, by the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=636.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=637.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now, what I wanted to address is something very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=643.553s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What is a Mustang?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=646.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not a word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=647.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know people, it's easy to say Mustang pride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=651.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What it means to be a Mustang is truly to love the city you live in, to represent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=657.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: your community with pride and distinction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=660.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what you boys and girls have done have been amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=669.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One thing I will say is that we have Coach Curley as your leader.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=673.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's the key, having a leader you can lean on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=676.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A person that wants to be involved in a young person's life, no matter what the circumstance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=684.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's easy to say when things aren't going well and teams aren't winning and you're losing, it's easy to say, well, they're no good, let's get rid of the coach and let's start all over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=695.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I find so impressive and I want you to understand, this isn't about winning and losing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=700.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You went to Fenway Park and you represented Medford with a lot of respect and pride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=709.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why I put this resolution through is for what you're doing off the field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=715.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A few things that this football team has done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=718.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've helped organize the national night out with the whole football team and the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=725.264s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Really showing what unity means and how everybody works together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=729.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You led that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=731.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In September, you helped empty out the senior citizens' basements and helped seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=737.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In October, you helped with the Unified Basketball League.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=742.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The day before Thanksgiving,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=744.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Before Thanksgiving game, we saw you guys over at McDonald Stadium helping with the unified flag football game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=752.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then you saw a bunch of football players in yards raking out people's yards that couldn't do it themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=759.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now you're helping with the Medford Family Network for their toy drive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=766.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=769.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I wanted to have this opportunity tonight to bring Coach Curley up and really commend you for what you have done and really put you on the pedestal that you deserve to be put on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=785.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One thing is having the leader to show you the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=789.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's an honor that I talk about John Curley tonight because John's a very special person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=794.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I love to hear is I got a phone call from a teacher<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=798.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they said, George, I saw this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=800.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I need to share something with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=803.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had a problem with the football player.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=804.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was being a little wise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=807.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I called Coach Curley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=810.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the next day, Coach Curley was sitting in the back of the room, just his presence there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=817.695s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we realized is that young man wasn't offended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=822.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was so taken back that Coach Curley was there to do what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=827.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To show him he cares.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=828.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to make sure that he's doing the right thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=832.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's the type of leadership we need in our school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=835.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what you boys have done and girls have done and gone out to the community and put together all of these community service hours, it's something we should as a city applaud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=845.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I wanna publicly thank you guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=848.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we put together a, do we have that at?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=861.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so we have accommodations that we put together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=878.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the Muffet Mustang City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=880.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The Muffet City Council award the this combination to and we'll say the young man's name, a young lady's name in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=889.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with the Medford High School football team and your commitment to community service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=893.824s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Congratulations on your accomplishments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=895.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Go Mustangs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=897.107s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can, we'd love just to recognize you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=899.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to call your name up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=900.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that Coach Curley, Coach Offit are going to help out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=904.514s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can, just before we get going, if Coach Curley has anything to say, I know that before we get going, I know we want to, I know some of the boys and girls want to get in and out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=912.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that, Coach, if you have anything to say, that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=985.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to figure one person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=986.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that Mr. Mr. Medford's here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=989.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, Mr. Chris Murphy, thank you for everything you do with the football association.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=994.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, and we really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=996.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You look fabulous by the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=997.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=998.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, coach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=999.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You ready?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1001.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1012.666s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, come on up if you're called.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1014.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1015.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So come on all the way around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1296.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, uh, coach, I know that we have a bunch of coaches that have been committed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1301.928s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that, uh, they've been great with the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1304.429s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you could just acknowledge them, I know Coach Offit is your right hand man, but anyone else that, um, need to address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1326.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, when you're a true Medford program, when coach Joe's, uh, leading you boys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1330.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that I appreciate coach for being, being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1333.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know he's at, he's at an appointment, but he's going to try to make it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1336.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If not, I'll come by the house myself and drop off his.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1339.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, uh, what, what, what we did is we put together a certificate that's going to be, uh, in a folder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1346.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to be really, we're going to be getting that out to you tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1348.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1349.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I thank you guys for coming out tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1350.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1351.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1356.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Coach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1361.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, it's easy to point things out when a young person does something wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1367.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It seems like that's an easy thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1369.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'm proud of tonight is that we're really putting you on a pedestal because you deserve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1376.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The opportunity, the time that you give on your own, like Coach said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1380.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when we talked and said that no one forces you to do anything, but you go out and do it because you love the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1387.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what true community is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1389.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm proud of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1390.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1391.148s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My fellow Councilors, thank you and have a great night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1393.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1394.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1706.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1776.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1842.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1935.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, if I can, is the anybody representing the city to answer any questions on this call?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1963.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the first time we've received this type of request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1984.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, so structurally, it's not unsafe or it's not gonna jeopardize the area around the well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1992.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not, it's pretty, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1997.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you're recommending this, Owen, is this something you recommend?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2004.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2099.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2135.041s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2137.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is the petitioner here this evening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2139.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hi, how are you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2142.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I've reviewed the paperwork.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2146.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything seems in order, sirs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2148.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what type of, if you could just give us just a brief synopsis to share with everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2187.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2187.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2188.289s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Cause I was falling into play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2189.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then, uh, how many employees do you have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2194.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's it? Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2195.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, and I hear great things about this, this product and, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2199.514s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're excited that you're moving to Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2201.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a great location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2203.115s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that my daughter loves it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2205.695s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's gonna be something we'll see in our family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2209.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I see everything in order, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2212.417s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would move approval after questions from my fellow councilors, if they have any.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2266.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2272.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3660.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3662.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Penny, for all your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3663.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've done so much for our community and I really appreciate everything you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3670.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3671.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, one thing I realized as I'm reading through this, this is, it's amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3674.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is, this is what we've let we've lacked here for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3677.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate your effort, but, uh, a most vulnerable community right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3682.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have we, I didn't see anything with the housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3684.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we partnering anything with the, with the method housing department to reach, uh, those families that I think that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3691.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3707.544s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so obviously there'll be a big piece of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=3709.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, definitely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5118.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5119.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Bob, again, the other person taking the heat, and I apologize for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5126.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not fair to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5130.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, no, and I'm not going to pile on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5132.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we should, you know, I think for preparations purposes, I think that maybe calling for a Committee of the Whole meeting with Bob once we have all this information<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5145.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: so we can sit down and really sink our teeth into these issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5149.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that, so you understand, Bob, you know, something as simplistic as people that are watching understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5156.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, when I was 14, I opened up a checking account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5158.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My dad said, okay, this is how you balance your checkbook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5162.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is how you spend your money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5164.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if you don't, if you don't have, if you have $100 in your account and you want to purchase something for $120, it's telling you you can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5172.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, you're responsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5175.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to control your own finance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5176.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, what was saying time after time here, we're getting papers from the mayor, we're getting requests from different Councilors about asking for money papers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5187.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to be honest, I haven't voted for a financial paper and approval in a long time, because I, I find it very difficult for this body to do their job, not understanding the basic<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5199.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: financial breakdowns of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5201.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You were there when we had the tough budget process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5204.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was horrifying for you being new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5206.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as we're going through this process, Bob, we haven't gotten one, one paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5212.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't gotten any information about where we're spending our money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5215.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here we are, God, almost January, January one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5219.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I want the public to know this is the hardship we're feeling in the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5226.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5227.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm trying to ask questions about legal matters and we don't have anybody to turn to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5233.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I apologize that you have to be here tonight and really be hung out to dry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5238.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm curious if the chief of staff is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5254.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, can we address the question to her?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5274.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's a simple question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5276.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the Chief of Staff has been out for legitimate reasons and she hasn't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5284.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She just started to ramp back up, but were you familiar that our finance director hasn't received any of this information from this council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5372.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I heard your answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5377.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't appreciate the response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5380.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that this has been a total lack of disrespect to this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5386.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have crises that we're dealing with right now that we're looking at financial support and hoping for some financial support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5396.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we don't know where we are financially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5400.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, so to move forward with any of these dog and pony requests, and then ask for funding for deeply needed, uh, resolves and not having an understanding of where we are financially is very difficult for me as a Councilor to make decisions, moving the city forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5425.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5428.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope everybody that's watching and understands realizes how dysfunctional this community looks right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5439.379s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many issues that we're seeing that coming across from us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5443.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is so totally embarrassing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5446.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm disheartened right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5447.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So Bob, again, I apologize for the answer that the chief of staff just gave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5453.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The understanding is this, we have been asking for money papers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5457.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the day after we had our budget and we've been trying to get some information, some valuable information of where we're going, what direction we're in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5466.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're trying to figure out what tonight's a very important meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5469.52s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's some resolutions tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5470.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're talking about some very important issues and looking to fund some very important issues, but getting the okay from the administration to fund papers and then not understanding where we are, because I believe the mayor, you were there when the mayor said as critical as last year's budget was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5487.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: next year's is going to be even worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5490.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what puts me on edge right now, Bob, is the fact that we haven't seen anything and we can't move to support our most neediest members of our community and resolutions that are coming forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5502.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I find this very disheartening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5505.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I find this very troubling and I don't know how my 16, 17 year old daughter<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5516.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: has the ability to run her finances better than what we're seeing with this multi-million dollar corporation called Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5524.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and again, I know it's not you Bob, but I had to express my concerns and disgust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5530.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5718.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please, I think until we have all the information in front of us and Bob has time now to get the documentation that we need to move this forward or to understand it, I think we need it immediately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5730.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's something that, you know, we've been asking for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5735.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: forever so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5828.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5860.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5861.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate taking this out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5864.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This has been a very emotional last 24 hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5868.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's been very intense and I wanted to make sure that if you allow me to give a small presentation that I prepared so I don't miss anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5884.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Medford's in crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5886.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not a new crisis, but one that has started to spiral out of control and has just caught the attention of the outside world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5895.999s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sadly, we had many years of warning given to us to prevent the latest incident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5902.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as we see today, those warning signs were ignored by the very people that were entrusted to protect our kids by acting on our behalf.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5912.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Most of you know my background as a former coach, teacher, and now Assistant Director of Recreation for Neighborhood Community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5922.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wanna look at a few fundamentals to see where we missed out, where we made our mistakes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5929.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First thing that came to me is, are our kids safe?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5934.099s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, they're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5938.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not the data that we need now, we now have the actual proof<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5942.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: from our experiences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5944.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we doing all that we can to keep our kids safe so they can learn and grow successfully?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5949.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, the warning signs are there and we ignored it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5955.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we unified on this issue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5958.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Absolutely not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5960.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sadly, some people take their responsibility serious while others do not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5966.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I question the personal motives<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5970.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: of some to simply protect their income versus protecting people that got them elected or hired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5981.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are outside groups currently bullying elected officials to exercise their views, which do not help to protect our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5990.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: National organizations, national movements, while we're having crisis here in our own backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5998.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is our division hurting our kids and the reputation of our city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6003.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, that's evident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6005.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The division in this great community is tragic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6010.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it continues, we'll just see the first of many situations that will bring our amazing city even further down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6018.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, two heads are better than one, and four heads are better than two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6024.041s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unified, we will overcome together,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6027.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: divided we will continue the sad, turbulent ride to a much worse place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6036.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, last night I was accused of politicizing this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6042.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My knee-jerk reaction was quickly defended to the categorization of being looked at and politicizing this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6053.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then I thought about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6055.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Of course I'm politicizing this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6057.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because that's the only way, the only mechanism that we, our kids and the citizens have to make any changes to our system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6066.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We live in a political system that requires checks and balances to protect our citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6072.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So being attacked with this term makes no sense and showed me exactly how those that are guilty continue to deflect away from their own inaction, neglect and responsibilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6087.486s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, we've learned that inaction equals action, meaning inaction enabled these outcomes, putting our kids in harm's way and making our parents petrified to send our kids to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6102.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the atrocity that we are looking at today, right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6110.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If anyone has been politicizing this issue, it's those that have been both enabling these outcomes and hiding from the consequences of their own inactions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6121.186s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We were elected by the people, for the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6125.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's time that we get to work for the people, especially our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6131.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: See, when we got elected by the people,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6135.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It should not be measured by winning or losing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6139.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It should be measured by the impact that we make and promises that we keep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6146.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is our opportunity that has presented itself to us today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6151.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The question was presented, what are we going to do about it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6157.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Here's what I propose to get us united, back on track and protect our kids the way that they require from us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6167.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First, I'm going to be asking the mayor to put together a team so we can put an implementation of safety that works with our teachers, our principals, our police department, so our kids feel safe when they go back on January 3rd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6191.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We want them to feel safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6194.794s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Meetings, consultants,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6197.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6199.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have true professionals in our building that we can work together over the next two weeks to make sure we have that plan in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6205.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sure of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6209.372s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have resolutions in place this evening that would ask the mayor to prepare an RFP to hire and train true security guards, four to five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6221.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Make sure that we have full staffing in the video room where our staff can watch a minute-to-minute action and who's going into the bathrooms, who's loitering in the hallways, to make sure our administration can see where these issues are happening and get<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6238.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the support there as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6241.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Last night, I believe it was Tony Puccio who brought up a very simple resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6249.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We ask our parents today to do everything, to be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6253.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he mentioned that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6255.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I thought that was a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6256.313s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I got home, I got a phone call from a former soccer captain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6259.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She went to school in Tulane, worked in Louisiana, and she sent me an article about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6265.313s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a program they use in the schools in Louisiana where they were having issues and concerns like we're having today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6271.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's called Dads in the Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6273.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe to be correct, we'll call it Dads and Moms in the Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6277.661s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we could put parents on a bus to go to a field trip to Plymouth Rock, then we could put parents in the school that want to assist our teachers to make sure they're just an extra eyes and ears as you walk the halls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6289.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I thank you, Mr. Puccio, for bringing that forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6292.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm going to ask the school committee to open up their meetings for public participation, where there's a dialogue like last evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6302.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if there's an issue with parents, students, or constituents, they have this forum to come and speak with a dialogue back and forth to make sure things are identified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6314.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The process that's in place right now, as some parents can tell you tonight, very daunting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6320.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to put it through, to ask to get approval, to read something, to write something up and making sure that what is going to be presented is approved is another form of censorship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6334.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If not, I'm gonna request this council to go back to the original request that Councilor Knight and I put forth as a ordinance change demanding that we put in place that format for the City School Committee so they have an avenue<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6350.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to have a voice and they can listen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6355.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this has been a very intense last 24 hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6362.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My daughter didn't go to school, nor did I believe close to 400 other students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6371.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The word back was that the police were there and they were present, but we also know that won't happen every single day for the rest of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6380.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I implore our school committee to work together with the police department to move forward to making sure that there's a plan in place over the next few weeks so we have our children feeling safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6401.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that leaves me with one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6406.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that she's not here right now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6409.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I want, I heard something last night from a very courageous young lady and I want to leave with something that she said that I take it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6416.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was directed to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6418.005s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's direct to all of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6419.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was very simple to, as she said, step up a step down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6424.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a responsibility and I hope we hear it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6430.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a responsibility to make sure that we're giving the tools to our leaders in the school, our principals and assistant principals, to make sure that they can run the schools as efficient as they did when they led the middle schools or before this administration, when they were part of the resolutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6452.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So let's unify this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6455.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's unify our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6457.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and let's make Medford the city that it's always been, an amazing place to live, work, and raise their family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6467.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8015.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8020.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The funding was there for the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8023.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe it was probably 80% of the funding that was cut for security over the last four years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8030.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the funding was there and the school system cut that funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8033.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8508.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8513.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: trying to be restrained and understanding something very simple that I want to share with my fellow Councilors that gave their opinions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8523.202s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Agree to disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8524.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done that many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8530.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8532.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're unsafe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8534.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're scared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8535.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our teachers are scared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8540.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To talk about money concerns and money issues should not be even a thought right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8548.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The thought and the discussion of 30 years ago, five years ago, is an embarrassment to me for the fact that this is happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8558.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is happening right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8563.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I talk about unifying, I talk about what I said as a national agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8571.297s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We see and hear the direction that the school committee has gone on many different levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8580.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And some school committees members have called me in the past and just didn't understand that they wouldn't fight if they didn't have their own voice, but to follow this national agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8594.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as I'm seeing,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8596.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the people that I looked at and trusted and admired, I'm seeing that they're taking not what's important today in our schools, not what's important, our children, not their safety, but to be in this council chamber yesterday and listen to some of these people that truly are aligned with people in this room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8621.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these issues are concerning to the community to understand<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8626.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we need to put that away, open our minds and be unified in the fact that the unification is needed for the safety of our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8637.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not what happened five years ago, not what happened 30 years ago, what's happening today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8643.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not gonna get the funding we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8646.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know that, but that's not gonna change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8648.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So bringing that up right now is really sad to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8654.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's just a buzzword and a check off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8659.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will tell you, we need movement now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8663.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need our school committee, our superintendent to move now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8670.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wanna see action now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8673.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's stop, let's hold school off for the next four days, three days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8676.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's bring our teachers into a room with our principals and let's find a solution right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8682.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So our kids are safe when it's time to go back to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8686.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the next few days are going to be useless.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8690.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's going to be no learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8693.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want to hear solutions from groups that are going to work together to make our kids safe on January 3rd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8701.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Safe when they go back to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8705.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to protect each other because what was said in another forum and how it was presented by this Councilor to people on different committees and try to protect what they're doing on the school committee side, I'm not afraid to speak for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8721.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Politically, I don't care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8723.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our kids are hurting and what people are seeing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8731.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and what they're hearing from the school committee are gender items that aren't protecting or looking at their safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8740.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was questioned that I was part of that school committee and there are legalities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8746.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I understood those legalities, but you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8750.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When it came to children's safety, George Scarpelli never swayed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8754.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I made sure that they were safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8757.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I never had this situation when I was on the school committee, thank God.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8763.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you, we can bicker back and forth and disagree, but ultimately, that wasn't my intention today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8773.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My intention is truly look at everybody and say, let's meet now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8777.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's bring everybody together now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8779.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's set a plan that's tangible that we can reach, that we're not gonna get grants from the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8785.071s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not gonna get funding from City Hall, but there's ways to get that done right now to make our children feel safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8794.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9834.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information. There's a difference between bullying and passion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9837.459s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what you lack, madam. You lack passion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9893.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information, Madam president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9897.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam Superintendent, yesterday a young man came to the podium and addressed the situation that happened. Did you hear the young man who described a very similar situation just a few weeks prior?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9911.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I asked the Superintendent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9915.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Was that addressed today? Did you contact the guidance Councilor that he talked to, to express the concern of the same people threatening him to stab him?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9927.671s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you address that today?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9947.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10443.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Would it be shocking, Madam Superintendent, that a few phone calls I did receive from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10449.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: personnel that were there to support, that there were still numerous students walking the halls freely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10458.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Has that even been addressed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10499.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, that's good to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10501.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As you approach the re-entry and starting the new year off, I would really hope, and what I've heard from the kids, is that your administration, yourself personally, bring the student body together so they can understand what's going on because they're lost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10519.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Over the last incident that happened, they were waiting for some sort of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10523.999s">[Scarpelli]</a>: acknowledgement of something and to keep them feeling safe, that was not done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10532.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope moving forward on the third, that the student body is in one area that they can see the leadership of our school system to show them that we're there and we understand what we're trying to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10545.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That hasn't been done yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10574.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's good to hear, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14642.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry, maybe you didn't understand what I meant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14646.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was the fact that I wanted to bring it back to today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14651.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to focus on today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14652.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can't go back to 30 years right now and worry about this today because today is the crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14659.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's my intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14824.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=14825.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15121.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15161.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15312.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15378.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15651.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GbhjYJ_J4oE&t=59.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would make the motion that we bring the city council pay down so we don't have restrictions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=16.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1029.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Apologize, I switched over to my laptop so I can see the presentation a little bit better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1035.953s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Going back, I know that for transparency's sake, if we could, Council President, can we please make it a motion to ask for the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1046.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Projections of new growth for the last 3 years through the chair through the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1053.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Assessor and the budget director's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1057.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I, you know, that just eliminates any questions that if I come up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1060.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I bring something up and it's something that won't be questioned because it's coming from the department that's supposed to give us that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1068.231s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would really appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1069.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1078.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, please the projections and projections and what we were what we end up getting if we could just for just so we can have an understanding of what we looked at in the past and what we actually had in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1091.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can at least estimate what we're really looking at because 2.5 is pretty pretty dismal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=1117.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2899.11s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President to the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2900.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Bob, thank you for giving us this information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2903.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what what what I'm a little, I'm a little nervous about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2907.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we just want to get through and get something on that will work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2910.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we saw it for a minute at the school with the school department with the, you know, the 2.5 million dollars that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2919.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they couldn't find and then they found and then there were a lot of budgets that were frozen and that really put the teachers in some difficult positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2931.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, just curiously on the city side, do we have any departments right now that we're looking to hold positions or cut positions or freeze their budgets for FY24?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2945.929s">[Scarpelli]</a>: um before we can get into 25 because there are rumblings out there that you know there might be some key positions even maybe an overnight position at dpw that we're looking to probably eliminate for the rest of the year and that's these are these are um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2961.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are these are questions that I think we need to know, especially if you're looking at the budget moving forward and seeing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2969.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, having every department trend, just for the sake of numbers in a budget, where do we, where do we look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2977.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In 2024 with our departments on the city side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3003.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3006.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So real quick, it's a simple question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3010.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As our budget director, do we have any departments right now that look like they're in jeopardy of freezing their budget or not having enough for them to finish their FY 24?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3084.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So for clarification through the chair, so we might have some freezes in some departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3090.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I think that when I asked the question, just to move forward as we move forward on this, and I'm hoping that our budget director understands that when we're asking questions that also has to do with the ARPA money, I find it a little befuddling to me that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3106.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our budget director says he doesn't see anything right now, but the chief of staff comes up and says well with our blah blah blah That we there are no there's no Definitives on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3117.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can as we're trying to vet out next year's budget and understanding how we got getting through this budget You know, I think we got the quarterlies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3126.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think today we got one two and three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3128.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I saw them again today I really appreciate that but um, you know, um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3135.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm hearing some trends and some concerns moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3138.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we could just get an update as a form of a motion for our next meeting, Mr. President, that if we do have any departments that are looking at some budget shortfalls in FY24, that we're prepared for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3154.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3211.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So Mr. Mr. President, if I can, this is this is so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3217.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, Bob, if you've taken that, that my comment and anything to be disrespectful to you, please don't think of that at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3225.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm looking at when we're asking questions to our budget director in the past, Bob.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3230.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in the past or in my other roles, when we have a question with the budget director, I would assume that they would have all the information in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3240.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you weren't prepared or worked with the other people that are working on this budget together and you didn't have those numbers, that's not your fault.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3247.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If anybody there took that as an insult, I apologize, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3254.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm just stating the fact, in the past when we've had budget meetings, and we've had other budget directors, and we've had other administrations, or working in other city municipalities and understanding the budget, when you're asking a simple question as, do we feel that any of our departments in the FY24 budget look like it's going to be funded,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3279.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would assume that we would know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3281.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You answered it by saying, well, from what I know, it looks like we're not going to have a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3286.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understood that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3287.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The chief of staff then came up and said, oh, maybe the I believe it was the ARPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3293.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're not we can't be definitive on that because of ARPA money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3296.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I I tend to I tend to really get really disappointed when leaders of our administration<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3305.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: come to that podium and accuse members of this council just because they're asking questions because they haven't been informed at all when it comes to information on the budget and they ask a question that wasn't clarified and then turn it around and make it sound like I insulted someone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3323.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been accused of this over and over again by this person and I find it offensive and that Mr. President and I hope you can take point to that because that is highly highly unprofessional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3334.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4178.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4179.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Two quick questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4180.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One, can we get a copy of this presentation emailed to us, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4186.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I've been held hostage from a virus, so if there's any way that we can get that emailed, I'd appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4196.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And next, just for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4200.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just for us to prepare us, Bob, and I know, like, again, I appreciate your hard work, but when we're doing our projections, our department heads looking at going through an analysis with, let's say, a 10% cut, an 8% cut, a 5% cut in their budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4221.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: just so they're prepared for next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4225.362s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I know that Councilor Beall said I missed, as we're talking to each department head instead of me asking them one by one, I know that Councilor Beall is correct from wrong when I missed the meeting last week that the conversation was that these were pure numbers that department heads gave us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4244.949s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I'd be interested to know if they were given that exercise to prepare us for any sort of cuts moving forward for FY25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4270.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, so but they're given to us as a wish list, correct, Councilman?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4291.331s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, but they weren't asked to do a cut proposal so that we can we can see that to prepare ourselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4298.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4299.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4300.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4302.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5797.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm in agreement with that, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5799.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would move forward with that as a motion, if that's what you need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=17.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=74.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=79.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=81.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a long time coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=82.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that it's funny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=85.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know if people know Councilor Caraviello and what kind of a person he is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=92.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Caraviello ran for mayor, unfortunately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=95.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In my view, he was a couple votes behind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=99.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But you would think that someone who's spent so much time<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=103.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in this chamber working for the Citizens of Medford, you'd think he'd be tired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=107.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But last week, I think he spent over 60 hours helping an 88-year-old<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=115.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: young lady that was being displaced from her apartment who was battling cancer, and he drove her all over the city to make sure that she was safe and her rights were protected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=130.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is the type of person Rick Caraviello is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=135.541s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've had the honor of working with Councilor Caraviello as an elected official and as our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=144.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: past patriarch and someone that I mentored myself against, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=149.739s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To receive this award from the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=151.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's perfectly fitting. And I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=157.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: miss you back here, but I know you're still working hard for the citizens of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=162.231s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We should all take a great look and understand how Rick Caraviello lives his life, because if we had more Rick Caraviellos in this world, I think Medford would be just a supreme place to live.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=174.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So congratulations, my friend, well earned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=751.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=752.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I have to put this forward for one simple reason, that the acknowledgment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=759.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that yesterday was a very special day, and I know that some of my fellow Councilors were there and showing their support to our veterans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=767.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, my wife ran another half a marathon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=772.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was there supporting her, but I wanted to make sure that this body recognized all of the sacrifices made for our military men and women, and really showed that respect yesterday, and understand where we are today is because of our veterans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=792.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1403.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: parks, open spaces, historical sites, and affordable housing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1410.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1411.186s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that this falls, just it falls in with the process and it's something that's so needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1416.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that it's been working, the process has been working, I think, in the cemetery and other places around the city to make sure that we take care of our tree canopy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1425.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1445.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1492.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1495.01s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A quick update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1495.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think everybody's waiting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1497.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So how's everything look?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1528.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's great news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1530.353s">[Scarpelli]</a>: really exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1530.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that, uh, Mr. President, I see that I know that we're waiting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1534.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything right now is pending.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1536.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as you said, this is provisional right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1538.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1539.64s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would move forward what we have in place right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1607.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3538.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3538.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I, I too feel, um, that we, we owe a certain amount of protection to our, our, our, uh, our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3547.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that we have tools in place that we're just not taking advantage of here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3553.005s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, this council really can't do much for you, but what we can do, we can work with the CPA like the city of Cambridge and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3562.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: put CPA funding to keep a mediation company on retainer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3567.313s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when these issues happen, you're not scrambling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3570.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's an avenue that you can come right here to City Hall to make sure that you're protected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3575.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that that's the beginning of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3577.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that my fellow councilor feels that what we're talking about right now, we have a group of people that are in dire need, that are afraid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3587.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I feel sympathy and I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3590.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But with, now, say no different, no different than Brooks family feels than the residents that reach out to me saying, George, I'm 78 years old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3603.917s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I lived in a fixed income.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3605.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I own my home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3606.719s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the process that this, that society has given us has, by success, has driven the cost of my home up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3618.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now they live in a fixed income.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3620.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now what you hear, you hear a council that says, let's have rent control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3625.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's do a tenure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3626.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's do a transfer tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3627.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's do a registration fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3630.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's do an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3631.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's do... that's frightening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3633.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we're on the same boat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3635.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think you have homeowners, and this is the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3638.613s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's very, it's difficult when you have some Councilors trying to divide the community by calling things fear tactics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3645.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3647.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People are scared because it's the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3649.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you own that home and you live there, and you didn't expect your $18,000 home you bought 35 years ago, that is now a million dollars, because some people behind this real feel like, because that house is worth a million dollars, that person that owns that house and that has to live there every day, that that's a wealthy person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3669.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, it's the same person that's sitting back here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3672.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the same person with the same fears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3675.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So let's not divide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3677.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's try to find options like the CPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3680.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's look at the CPA for mediation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3685.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's look at our CPA tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3686.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had Councilor Marks has been preaching for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3690.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Look at the space that we have, that Medford owns, that we can sell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3698.487s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can allow building use on those small parcels that you could take that money and put it in to the affordable trust fund that, by the way, we haven't even established yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3709.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not even up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3710.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But imagine that funding coming in, that the Brooks family comes to us and says, what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3716.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're being pushed out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3719.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, we could plant the seed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3722.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But listen, I can also go get an oak and bring it right here and plop it right down the middle of this forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3728.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there are avenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3730.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So don't don't let's let's be honest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3733.636s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I fear and I will work as hard as I can for this organization because I hate to see people leaving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3739.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3741.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same time, you can't look at the other side and say, it's all your fault.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3745.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're gonna move you out so everybody's in that boat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3749.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to find the common ground that we can all work together to make sure that we all want affordable housing, that people aren't scared to leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3758.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure, listen, I think that one thing we should focus on is look at the developers that are coming into the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3766.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: find a way that we have legislation behind us that would protect owners that or renters that live in their home that are being pushed out for for total gain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3777.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I agree, I'm going to support you 1000%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3780.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I'm going to make the motion that we ask us a CPA organization to fund a mediation retainer right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3790.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because again, as much as we all have good intentions back here, we don't have the power<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3795.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to do what needs to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3797.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, we had Councilor Caraviello come here today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3800.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He worked all last week on an 88-year-old woman that was being displaced, who has cancer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3806.77s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he came up to City Hall to ask for help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3808.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And do you know what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3810.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing, because nobody answered the call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3814.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a City Councilor that's worked his tail off to make sure he's protecting a resident of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3819.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we all understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3821.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is where the unity comes in instead of saying that, oh, this is this and this is that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3827.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to figure out a way to make sure affordable housing is done correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3831.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we use the avenues that we already have in place here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3834.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just haven't tapped into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3836.466s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3868.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3871.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have the right to point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3890.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you're ready, when you're ready, point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3895.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With the gavel today, I see where it's coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3896.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But a point of information, I will tell you, the misinformation that's going out there was a letter signed by two of the leaders in this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3907.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's exactly what's scaring people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3909.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because it's actually actions not it's not words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3912.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's actions and your actions were something totally opposite<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3917.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, then why haven't we had the meeting on the tenure on the transfer tax then?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3920.796s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why haven't we have committee on the transfer tax so we can point out and pick out what you just said, Councilor Bears?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3925.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if you came out and we sat as a community and said this is what we need. Let's not let's not hurt the homeowners like you said in that in that context.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3935.048s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm for you a thousand percent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3936.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we haven't done that, have you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3991.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's one project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3992.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's one project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3996.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Speak the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3997.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You want to talk about not speaking the truth?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3999.651s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's affordable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4000.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The CPA is not phasing that out for one project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4184.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4190.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are people getting evicted?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4192.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4269.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information, just to be clear, I'll give you an example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4274.115s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Today, I talked to a homeowner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4275.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I talked to a homeowner today that has about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4282.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 18 feet that the city owns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4284.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're willing to come in and pay that 18 feet to build an addition for the senior citizen parent to move in with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4290.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know it sounds nice and it sounds powerful to say developers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4295.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not all developers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4297.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have small parcels of land that homeowners that are bought these properties that will gladly pay, that would feed our trust to help communities like we have here at the Brooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4308.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5453.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can, just if we can, what is the reasoning for that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5458.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I can understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5460.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5472.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I would follow up that the mayor and it would be great if we had a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5478.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would really focus on the city solicitor really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5481.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: paving a way for this organization so they can have a point person in the city<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5485.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they could talk, not a city council that really we can't do much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5489.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can just also request that the mayor, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5494.456s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Get involved and use her, um, executive power to see what we can do to assist this organization. Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5508.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5522.423s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5523.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to at least investigate, maybe send the subcommittee that we can look at, you know, a request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5535.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: OK, so maybe we change that just that we look to send this to subcommittee, that we invite the CPA in to see what that would entail, to make that a piece of the puzzle that one of our residents did say that put another tool in the toolbox with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5804.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5983.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure, my amendment would be that, now again, this would be the whole presentation, so this is a little odd and a little bothersome to me as a city council, but I will tell you what we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5996.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The amendment will be that I would look for the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6000.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the city council to ask the mayor make sure we get it right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6008.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would like to make sure that we make a motion for the mayor to appropriate $5 to $7 million needed to level the school budget through the free cash<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6023.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: through free cash and by the process that we first take that, make that as an appropriation before free cash is certified and we announce for what that is used for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6040.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now if I can, Mr. President, is that efficient?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6048.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll tell you what, Mr. President, don't appreciate it, but I will tell you, the question that we had was the, Mia's process and how she brought this forward and the irresponsible process that she moved forward on social media and then in city council and school committee meetings, where she talked about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6072.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the option of free cash being used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6075.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $2 million is committed to fire trucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6078.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $2.3 million is committed to an OPM design for the new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6084.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $1.2 million for OPM for the HVAC system issues at the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6089.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have to rebuild Freedom Way for $10 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6092.379s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have to fix HVAC systems in the schools for $15 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6096.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Estimates for middle school alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6098.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have to put more money on water and soil infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6100.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that good, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6101.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So can I proceed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6129.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I would present something and explain it to you and that'll get that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6132.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That'll explain it, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6170.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So not if it's time sensitive to ask a motion to entertain this before the certified, the free cash is certified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6215.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's called,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6218.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: shutting it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6219.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's used,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6224.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it's an episode used to do that. Shame on you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6264.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6327.159s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6328.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, this is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6331.91s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate for my fellow colleagues to help me express what I've been hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6338.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm not going to get into what was said earlier, because I think that that's why we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6344.717s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the communications that I received from residents with the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6351.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, the discussions of rent control and the, you know, the 2% tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6358.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're talking about, you know, the registry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6362.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then we're talking about what the mayor has presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6365.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What she said was a 2.5% override, which by the way, publicly, I will tell you, I'm not opposed to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6373.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She talked about debt exclusions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6375.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not opposed to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6377.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I publicly say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6378.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was one of the only Councilors that brought a debt exclusion to this body that they've never done it before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6384.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it was voted down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6386.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I understand this process we need to follow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6389.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what comes to mind is I've said it over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6395.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we heard it tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6397.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Until we exhaust<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6399.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: until we exhaust everything in our pockets that we can show that we're not making mistakes and just being reactionary on taxation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6414.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because I've identified many, many different options that the mayor hasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6418.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've met with the building department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6419.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are no permits out there for any sort of development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6422.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I say development, I speak of the development that everybody talks about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6426.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just had a conversation about it, about affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6429.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor lost 600 affordable housing units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6433.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But more importantly, she lost a huge tax bracket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6437.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She lost a huge, between 3 to 5 million, just in one building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6443.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for permits and fees, one building, and look who we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6448.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Look at the problems we're having right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6450.907s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this tactic by the mayor, by putting this out there, is something quick and easy for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6457.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's done nothing for five years, honestly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6459.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The Beer Hall is her claim to fame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6461.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We really haven't moved the city forward at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6463.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're not bringing new revenue at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6468.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so now what I'm getting to my point very simply is this, I didn't, I wouldn't support a rainy day account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6476.763s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as I look at the options now, and the options I see have to be really expressed and understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6485.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because a lot of people that have come to me, they're not against working together for an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6492.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're not against working together for a debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6496.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but they want the data to prove it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6500.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They wanna see, are we doing it right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6503.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You don't just put out a tax, just a tax, just to cover your keister, because that's what she's doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6508.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that's your agenda, because you've told us this, but the bottom line is, let's listen to what that last caller said, Councilor Bears, the other night, because I think that's what brought this forward in my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6520.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She asked you,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6523.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She asked you, Mr. President, what if the override doesn't pass?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6529.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What if it doesn't?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6530.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you said, right, it's going to devastate our school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6534.91s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The vote is in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6536.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it feels, it affects our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6541.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It affects our teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6543.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It affects our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6545.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And even if it's a 1% chance that that override would fail, are we willing to gamble our students' educational process for this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6556.297s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like I said, we can look at, as a council, bringing forth the rainy day account that the mayor asked for, we appropriate it correctly, we earmark that money, and everything goes level funding to schools, and maybe she can't do the Freedom Way for another year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6576.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at least that now brings two groups, and that's what it is right now, the people that don't want Proposition 2.5 override, and people that do want the Proposition override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6588.822s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what we can do is take that time to sit together and probably, because I know Councilor Bears said it, there's a finance group that's been working since last April, I believe he said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6600.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with the mayor, I'm sorry, September, the mayor, the chief of staff, Councilor Bears, Council President Bears, Council Vice President Collins, and school committee member, Jenny Graham, excuse me, Vice Chair Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6615.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the five of them have been working on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6617.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the question that everybody's been saying is, well,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6622.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What have they worked on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6623.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know Councilor Bears said, when it's time, they'll put everything out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6627.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But for right now, we don't have that time to wait and put it out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6630.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because right now, are we willing to gamble our students' future next year on a possibility of this divide not making it happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6644.855s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I know I got people emailing me saying that something went out on a social media site and shame on you, George Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6651.621s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm one person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6653.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm one person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6655.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as I read it, the question was, is this a fair tactic by the school committee and the mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6663.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Of course it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6665.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Of course it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6666.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because there were no other avenue presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6669.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was only one avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6671.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We did nothing for five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6674.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: On June 20th of 2023, the budget meeting, I sat here and said, you're going to destroy our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6682.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We are going to be in financial ruins if you pass this budget just because you want to get elected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6688.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're going to use ARPA money, which by the way, which by the way, I use ARPA money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6694.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're told specifically,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6696.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: do not use ARPA money unless it's sustainable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6699.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, our mayor took that money and the ESSA money, and the school committee did, and they've level funded a budget just to get elected because she didn't want a black eye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6708.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's say what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6710.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But here we are today now, here we are today ready to gamble on our children's future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6717.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's not a scare tactic, that's legitimate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6720.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If the override does not pass,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6723.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: then quote unquote, our schools will be devastated with layoffs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6730.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're gonna hurt teachers, we're gonna hurt children, and we're gonna destroy this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6735.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I implore my fellow Councilors to please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6739.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: follow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6740.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's put the motion through that we ask the mayor to bring through a rainy day account that we appropriate the funds needed to level fund the school budget and make sure that everybody is whole because that was another question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6755.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I got a phone call from school committees where they were astonished the other day that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6759.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that the chair, I think, was astonished because her answer was, no, everything goes back to the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6765.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the superintendent sat in front of us the other day, and I've got calls from teachers, I've got calls, that's not true, they said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6772.105s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, it's manipulating for what they should do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6775.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're not being transparent enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6778.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I please, I implore you to let's, let's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6783.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's focus on free cash, level fund this budget, let's build on our children's future, and then work on if we really need an override and debt exclusions, and then work together as a community to make sure it passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6797.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6849.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Shame on you. Shame on you. You're just a bully with a gavel. You're a bully with a gavel. You're out of line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6857.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You let me answer. I have the right to point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6868.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're willing to gamble on kids' future on an override instead of looking at real money that our residents, that the mayor mismanaged and left out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6878.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Bottom line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6937.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can't, we can't move forward and discuss it and the mayor can't move forward to look at the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6951.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=52.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=54.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=56.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=56.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let me get my notes if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=59.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This past week, City of Method lost a great friend, Joe Rosetti.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=66.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If people that neighbors that know Joe, Joe's family grew up with Ashley's daughter, Ashley, and son, AJ, over in the Wellington area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=75.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, Joe has been a lifelong dedicated coach to so many of our youth football players and just recently came back to our method high school football staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=86.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, uh, Joe battled some, uh, some health issues over the last couple of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=92.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And whether he was, uh, rolled up to the field or home, listen to it, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=99.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: through online watching games, he was so dedicated to our kids and he'd be a great, he's a great loss to our community and just wanted to send condolences to the Rossetti family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=110.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know his wife, Sherry, has always been by his side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=113.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I remember them when I taught at the Osgoode School and they were a pillar of the community and he will surely be missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=166.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=169.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: James Jimmy Burns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=171.613s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Another<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=172.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: another loss for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=175.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Burns was a lifelong Method resident before moving to the Cape after his retirement, and he leaves a family behind that really leaves a hole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=186.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Burns is a member of the Bedford High School Hall of Fame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=190.739s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was a legend basketball coach here at Method High School, coached a lot of our kids or now adults in CYO, and he passed suddenly last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=202.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and we just wanted to share our sympathy and our condolences with the Burns family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=566.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've had some trouble even getting the updates from our actuals from this administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=577.247s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe we were doing pretty well up until right before the election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=583.289s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe June, July, August, we were getting redacted information for our city's budget, but we haven't seen anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=592.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and to establish another fund or give this administration control of more money without the checks and balances that I think we're surely lacking here in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=603.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wouldn't support this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=604.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, you know, the...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=616.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think what frightens me, Mr. President, is the Chief of Staff said herself, she mentioned with the ARPA funding, if we're gonna use this type of funding, the way we manage the ARPA monies or the ESSA monies, we're gonna be in serious trouble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=632.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's like, until we know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=640.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry, I think until we know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=642.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we have a legitimate, transparent financial department that's going to keep this city abreast on all of our financial doings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=652.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it would be a huge error for this council to support it for the fact that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=660.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've seen what happened during the budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=663.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had a financial director that can't tell us what's going on with an actual budget that they gave us last year, saying the numbers weren't correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=672.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have different organizations that are still waiting for their retro funding, saying the software is antiquated, so they can't get that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=682.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to think that we want to give more money somehow to this administration, I think it would be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=689.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it be responsible for this, this, this, this committee do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=694.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would recommend that we table this until we get a further understanding of where we are when it comes to updating this council on our fiscal day to day or our fiscal needs and responsibilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=710.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is another pool of money that if we approve,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=712.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to, you know, it's going to come back to us and we're going to be made the scapegoats for the lack of true transparency in that office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=720.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would move that we table this, Mr. President, that be form of a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=724.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=943.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, Mr. President, Mr. President, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=951.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do what you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=953.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=954.824s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=955.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hey, hey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=960.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hey, listen, listen, this isn't the way, this isn't the way to behave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=966.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=967.796s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=969.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have every right to come to this podium, but please give us the respect that this office deserves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=974.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We want to get to resolutions, but yelling out like that, that's not going to get anything done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=979.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you want to speak, this forum's here for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=981.29s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Come up and speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=982.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I listened, come up and speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=984.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yelling out doesn't help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=985.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It really doesn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=986.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please, it's only going to make this a longer, more miserable, disrespectful process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=991.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're all here for a reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=992.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We want Medford to be as best as it can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=995.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this forum's there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=996.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So just take advantage of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1024.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did Ellie take the batteries?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1608.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, we'll make a motion and we'll do that tonight, but at the end of the evening, but again, we can recommend that the mayor come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1617.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the chief of staff is here in her stead if we have questions for her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1622.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was the business area and the person who presented this on the budget that the issues are right now is, we don't know like most communities have a working budget, you, you understand where the money is being spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1638.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm just saying it's everybody else isn't it something to you know I'm just letting everybody know the issue is this council doesn't see that we don't know either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1646.187s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I actually put the school, I put the superintendent on the, on the docket tonight as a resolution because we're hearing rumors because right now they're just rumors to us that the school budget is in the whole 2.5 million for this year so we don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1660.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these are the issues why I wouldn't vote for this because I think that without understanding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1665.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we can't move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1666.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I also think that we have we have a few new Councilors that weren't here when this process started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1671.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think it would be it would be beneficial for them to sit in a meeting to start this whole process over and understanding what a rainy day account is and what it's used for and how they're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1681.949s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are other ways if there are emergencies to help with different scenarios, but I'm not going to get into that tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1688.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'm saying is I don't support this because we don't know what our fiscal future looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1695.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There is no last year we didn't get we we didn't even know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1698.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't even think we got a written budget after it was passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1703.045s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1703.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We got a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1704.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1704.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we got it right after we passed the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=1706.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had nothing to work from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2570.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, I think that that's probably one of the questions that people are fearing, is what's going to constitute an emergency?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2579.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is the fact that there is a shortfall in the budget, that that would constitute an emergency, something that should have been handled through our general funds, that now can come to us to say we can build<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2592.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to bail the city administration out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2595.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We say it's a roof, but what is going to constitute an emergency that this fund can be used for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2601.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that that could be a little enlightening for everybody, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2617.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, this is where this council, we fell in this gap with being put on the spot by the firefighters piece, the civil service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2625.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's making us to be the scapegoat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2626.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're gonna say, let's do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2629.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then there's gonna be a huge shortfall because they're gonna cut teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2633.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2634.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then they're gonna come to the podium, look at us and say, now you voted down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2640.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or something that's an emergency in the city because they didn't fund it correctly, they're gonna come to this council and say, okay, you voted for the stabilization fund, now you're gonna have to vote on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2651.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Don't let it get to that point, that's what I'm telling you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2654.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know if you see this, but we're being made to be the scapegoat for her mistakes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2658.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So just be careful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=2661.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, let her do it, but not from this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3337.474s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just, thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3339.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want to come full circle, just to understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3341.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The comments that I made earlier, I think that it's out of frustration and understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3347.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we're moving forward with initiatives that are coming forward through this council, and there are people that are questioning those initiatives, I think the biggest issue why this has blown up so much is the understanding that the questions that we all have,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3363.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it that we don't have enough money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3366.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that we're not funding it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3367.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or is it that it's just being mismanaged?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3370.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because that that is the ultimate question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3372.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been part of this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3374.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been part of this council for years now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3377.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With the former mayor and the former financial director, we saw everything we watched things happen live right in front of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3385.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we knew to prepare as we went forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3387.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with, with this administration, we haven't had that luxury.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3391.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these are the issues that I feel to go full circle, like I said, this isn't to attack anybody, this isn't to say that this, this fund wouldn't be good, it wouldn't be good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3401.304s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The fact that it's not transparent, and we don't truly know what the fiscal climate is, and where we stand, we just heard a school committee member<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3410.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Has anyone talked to you about a $2.5 million deficit in the schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3414.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because no one has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3415.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one's told me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3416.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But where does it have to come from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3418.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It has to come back to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3419.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the mayor is going to come back to us and ask us, where are we going to approve this money, everyone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3424.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Where last year at the budget, we warned her, we begged her, please do not use these funds this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3431.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The ARPA funding, we looked about why is our infrastructure so bad?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3434.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you realize that neighbor communities use millions and millions of dollars for what that was intended for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3439.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that was for infrastructure needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3441.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're seeing in our community, it's need to fill the gap in the ordinary budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3447.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now it's left us in big trouble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3449.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So all I'm saying is, as we're moving forward,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3452.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whether this is good or whether it's bad, whether we're voting for one thing, whether we're voting for another thing, understand something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3458.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have an accurate picture to make a sound decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3463.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's common sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3464.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all the full circle I wanted to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3466.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing against anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3467.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't personal, but this is very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3470.98s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know what's going on in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3472.761s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one's seen anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3474.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3474.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one's talked to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3475.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What was the last?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3476.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have you met the financial director?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3478.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have they come up to give us a report?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3479.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Has anybody said anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3480.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3482.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know, but we know we're gonna be meeting and we know what's gonna be said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3486.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna be in fiscal crisis in a few months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3490.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if someone says to me, it's because we don't tax enough or we don't give enough money, we don't know that because our administration isn't transparent enough for educate us in the community to say, this is why we have a shortfall and this is why we need a tax or this is why we need that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3510.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, careful with that window.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3513.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't wanna beat a dead horse, but I'm just saying, these are just common sense issues that I'm bringing up to understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3520.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't truly know if this is a structural issue, if this is a mismanagement issue, or this is a lack of collecting issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3528.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know because we're not educated and we're not given the tools to succeed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3533.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's why I think it's a slippery slope for this council to keep moving forward initiatives and truly not understanding our fiscal picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=3541.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7336.814s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7337.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the dialogue, but I think that what my fellow Councilors have to understand, even though it was a few weeks, I think you have to understand the concerns that homeowners have in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7352.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've talked about the CPA and the 1.5% of our tax money going to affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7362.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've identified that we're really not using that properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7367.805s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've talked about issues that I want you aware of so we can understand that this just isn't about a 2% tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7375.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In the last few weeks, we've heard the CPA tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7379.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've talked about this 2% tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7381.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've talked about rent control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7383.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's rumblings about a proposition to an app override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7387.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Talks about a $2.250 million new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7391.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are identified initiatives that my colleagues have brought forward one time or another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7396.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's not just one little issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7399.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're not talking about one issue that's riling up the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7402.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a combination of a bunch of different issues that are affecting who?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7407.949s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Homeowners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7414.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We mentioned, again, I revert back to the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7418.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talk about not having enough affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7422.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, this administration themselves stopped three 40B projects that would assist us in creating more housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7436.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We keep mentioning the highest, only the highest earners, only the highest homes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7441.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I'm going to give you an example because I don't think anybody else in this council has this perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7446.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I own a home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7447.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have a father.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7452.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: just to put it in perspective, I have I have I have a home that I purchased.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7458.539s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have my dad who came to this country, worked very hard to purchase his home, a two family home on Paris Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7466.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He killed himself that home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7468.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He built that home and now that home is worth $1.2 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7472.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what's offensive and what's bothering the community is to think that why should a penny of those people's hard-earned money go to any tax?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7496.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm just putting this all in context because this is being, this is being portrayed as, this isn't, this is just something to just touch base on and go after and just talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7509.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that's dividing this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7512.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Another piece dividing our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7514.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We keep talking about affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7516.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talk about a few different issues that I agree with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7519.362s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we need these, these homes need help, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7521.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These homeowners, excuse me, these renters that live in these condos that are being moved out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7527.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We understand that, but unfortunately, that's what happens when things prosper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7532.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what happens when you live near Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7534.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now taking it and throwing away the baby with the baby water, it's just hurting our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7539.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that there are ways that we can do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7542.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I'm gonna revert back to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7545.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're talking about an affordable trust fund, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7549.041s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A trust that we talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7551.582s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Affordable housing trust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7552.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Housing trust, correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7553.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7554.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it even in place yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7557.202s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, we voted for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7558.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it in place yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7560.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not a place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7561.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's no committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7562.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They haven't done anything yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7569.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it in place yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7570.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, to even talk about it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7572.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's premature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7576.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's disrespectful, this community, to say, okay, this is what they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7581.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's not just 2%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7584.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a dialogue that's spinning around the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7587.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the community, you know, it's funny, I appreciate people coming out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7591.574s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate, I'm gonna say this again, but where were you in November?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7596.316s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because this didn't just sneak up on you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7599.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I am gonna tell you, I respect all my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7603.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I respect everybody behind the reel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7605.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To run for an office is very difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7608.209s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, as you can see, our politics don't align with some of my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7615.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's why when it comes to November, you have to understand these are the impacts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7619.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I understand we have residents that wanna rush things through, I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7624.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But there's more involved in our community, just this one issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7627.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is just the tip of the iceberg.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7629.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we talk about a 2% tax, we still haven't defined the 1.5% of tax that goes to the CPA and how it hasn't been used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7640.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We also haven't talked about the 40B projects that the mayor has stalled to help with that affordable housing issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7648.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have a trust that's not actually in play yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7654.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we've heard comments over and over again talking about how we're pricing out the working class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7664.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who do you think owns these homes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7665.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the working class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7673.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm lucky, I'm lucky that when I said to my dad, I said, I want to move to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7680.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I've heard this from some of my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7682.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he said, and I said, this isn't fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7684.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have a degree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7686.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I went to college, I should be able to afford a house, but I can't afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7689.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know what he told me to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7690.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He looked me straight in the eye and says, well, one job doesn't do it, go get three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7693.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's what I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7698.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my home, my home that was purchased at 220,000 is probably appraised at 800,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7703.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not ashamed to say it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7705.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm proud to say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7707.621s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But everybody has this opportunity to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7711.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You just have to go to work and do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7719.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the dialogue, the dialogue that's being spun that we can we can mold this to whatever we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7724.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's it's really, really disingenuous, because it's exactly who you're hurting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7731.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the homeowners or hardworking people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7733.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've heard more from renters that have called me says please, with all these initiatives, don't do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7739.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I love my landlord.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7741.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Most landlords are great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7742.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we have bad landlords.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7744.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But you're lumping everybody into this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7746.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you're going to destroy this community, whether it's rent control, whether it's taxing, whether it's whether it's an override, whether it's whatever it is, we're killing our homeowners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7758.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7761.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know this is terrible, because now what's going to be spent tomorrow on social media?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7766.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Scarpelli hates renters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7769.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hate, I'll be honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7771.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been fortunate enough to have in my father's home on Paris Street, to have five renters since we bought the house back in 1972.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7780.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And out of those five renters, because of a good landlord, like my brother and my father,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7787.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Four of those people have gone on to purchase homes in Medford because they work with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7796.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The other thing is, I've heard this tonight too, that of course the real estate associations are pushing this all because the real estate has nothing to do with the true homeowners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7805.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if you look out in the audience and we do have real estate, a bunch of real estate agents, but the common denominator with those real estate agents are, they all live in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7815.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and at least for the most part have lived in Medford and that I've talked to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7821.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the whole idea is, the whole understanding that they're getting 7% on purchasing, that's why they're doing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7828.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, really, the homeowners are getting nervous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7832.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're saying, holy cow, I'm gonna sell my house now, or I'm gonna raise my rent to $5,000, because if it does go to rent control, I wanna be ahead of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7841.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the fear that we're causing here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7843.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know if you guys understand this, because maybe you haven't lived in a home or run a home in Medford and understand the true impact, but it's dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7852.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So like I said, there's a lot of movement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7856.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll read some comments from residents that have reached out to me to ask me to read things that couldn't be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7864.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll do that later, because I know there are a lot of people that wanna talk, but we have to understand something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7868.681s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't just an issue that's gonna go to subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7871.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or go to a committee or where we can maneuver.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7874.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have to understand there's a huge fear in this community from renters and homeowners that what we're trying to do, what we're proposing to do is going to change their lives dramatically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7886.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just want you aware of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7888.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=10618.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and how to fund that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=10619.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whether it's taxing homeowners, whether it's a $250 $250 million school and how to fund that, whether it's rent control, whether it's this tax, whether it's whether it's a proposition to an app override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=10632.661s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was my comments of why this issue has been so electrifying in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=10639.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=10640.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But obviously, I also want to say two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=10643.164s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a this isn't a method is in a town.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=10646.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=10647.705s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want everybody got to fix that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=10649.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because we hear that too much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=10651.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And method is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=10654.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=10655.747s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12064.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Alex.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12067.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12068.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can, you're doing a great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12070.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm so proud of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12071.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's get through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12072.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12074.981s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Next, name and address the record at the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18285.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information that counts as a Councilor Scarborough brought up some good points and I appreciate that I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18291.311s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this council also has to understand this dialogue being said that someone threw out bad information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18297.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm gonna be honest with you, the feedback that I got back from people was the fact that we had a meeting with one of our subcommittees that's also been put forth to me that's very confusing to people to what they were used to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18314.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the document that you have in place<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18317.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is very, it could be very cumbersome for just the average person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18322.553s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not everybody is involved in government and understands this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18326.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think I mentioned that to have something where it really highlights what the old subcommittees were and how we're tying them in, we didn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18338.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, but not from what I was told, but I'll go over that with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18341.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the other concerning is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18345.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What started this off was the whole rent control issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18349.571s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The meeting was called for home rule petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18354.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what it was called for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18356.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Two hours before the meeting, information went out about a litany of rent control issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18362.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is compounded with that the comment was put out there for 2%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18368.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there was a dialogue out there said 2%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18372.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what happened was you had people that are invested that wanted to get the word out because they don't feel like they're being heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18382.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we have to be realistic that we do a terrible job in really informing our community, terrible job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18391.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even the conversation that we had in subcommittee talking about having a newsletter with our Councilors writing it and saying we could start it, but where does it go to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18402.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It goes to the same has, but the have-nots don't get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18406.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I said, it's the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18408.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have to find a mechanism that hits everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18411.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have a newspaper, so we don't have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18413.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But that's why these issues get brought into this atmosphere and why so many people are so contentious because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18422.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they're hearing it as something attacking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18431.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18431.507s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know I know that just so just like you said, I know that there is a group that they're having a kickoff event on May 2, and it's for all method<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18442.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is a group of residents organizing to keep Medford informed about important issues that affect your housing as well as the issues that affect your quality of life here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18453.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I applaud that grassroots organization because I think that's what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18457.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's welcome to everybody from what I've told, and just come on in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18459.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And even if you get your name on an email, maybe that's how we start that conversation that we talked about at subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18845.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just love saying no to me by the way that's a no time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18848.574s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm counting, I get a radio.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18850.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18922.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is from,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18924.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is from residences dear method city council, I'm unable to make tonight's meeting live or on zoom due to conflict, I want to express my thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18934.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: on tonight's real estate tax proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18936.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand the issue of affordable housing and the need to address this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18940.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe tonight's meeting will raise more awareness to our affordable housing needs in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18945.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I for one will certainly pay more attention to this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18948.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm a lifetime resident of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18950.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I raised my family here and went to Medford public schools and have contributed to the community in many ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18956.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In fact, that's what I'm doing tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18959.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think what's missing in this whole issue is the fact that there are thousands of different scenarios that homeowners have been planning for sales of their homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18967.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Many people I know are thinking of their home as an asset for retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18971.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we all know the cost of living and the cost of health care in this area are tremendously expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18977.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Some have leveraged their homes values to offset the college education of the children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18982.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Others were hit with illness and sent them in a different direction in life and thus the need for this asset is paramount to living a normal life in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18991.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know this from experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18993.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Most of us are not real estate moguls looking to make a fast buck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=18997.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're citizens who have worked hard our whole lives in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19002.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We deserve the right to use the sale of our home to make the right decisions for our families and our future in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19008.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please do not derail the thousands of plans citizens have laid out for themselves by now blindsiding them with another tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19017.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's Jim McCarthy, 37 Blakely Road in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19021.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19546.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19549.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I think that this is a very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19553.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a hot topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19554.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that one thing that I would recommend is as we move forward with our committee meetings, I know that we have in the past been a little free and adding information before the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19568.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it'd be important that we try to figure out what the president and our leadership team, that as we move forward, when we send out these topics, when you talk like use the rent control issue,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19579.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that the information gets out there so residents can see that, because I think that's one of the things that played into this evening was the fact that that issue was so big, and that information wasn't really put out that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19593.368s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was put out as home rule petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19595.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now legally that's the way they've done, but in all sincerity, it's, it's that starts the divide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19602.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that whether we change our way of business, Mr. President, and how we allow ourselves to present information for certain meetings, I think that's something we should revisit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19617.486s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But a question that I had was, we keep skipping over a step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19622.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody keeps saying here, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19624.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we go to the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19625.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's one person we're not talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19628.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What is the mayor saying about these issues?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19632.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Has anyone talked to the mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19634.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because this is funny, what I see that it's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19638.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the most important person suppose in our community, our leader.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19642.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we have yet to hear from her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19645.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's very busy fighting right fights, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19648.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, postponing meetings for two months, we'll get into that another day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19651.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the mayor hasn't been transparent in anything we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19657.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One of the issues we hear right now is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19660.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why so late was because something might have been very simple, really turned into a snowball effect to the fact that we truly don't know what our budget looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19671.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know you have the resolution coming up this evening, and I had, I would have motions going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19677.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know if we're going to get to it, truly don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19679.187s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the truth of the matter is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19682.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to know where the mayor stands with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19684.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So whether it's passed or not, I'd like to, as an addition or a separate motion, that the mayor is involved in these meetings and her administration to help us if this moves forward to craft something that's reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=23.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=953.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=957.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=959.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate Councilor Collins going through these different scenarios, but for the newer members, I think the biggest piece that was really frightening for the business, especially coming out of the pandemic when we first started this discussion, if we all remember, was the protection of the brick and mortar businesses and, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=982.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: different out of city vendors coming in and not having the same requirements, but just coming in and taking business away from our brick and mortar who pay in and committed to our community for forever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=997.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, as long as they're there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=999.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I do agree with Councilor Bears though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1003.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, you wish that there's a more, more, just an easier answer to this, because the whole idea that the premise that we've been working on is really, you know, when the mayor has a program that, that a school might have a function and they want to bring in a food truck, that it's, it's, it's easier just to go to the, go to a separate department and have that permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1030.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1031.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, I this can this can get very convoluted as we hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1037.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But, you know, my hope is was that with this, we'd get to a point where it would be streamlined and not so cumbersome that if there was an emergency situation, if there was an issue with with, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1053.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: different organizations within our city, whether it's school or a fundraising organization that wanted a food truck for a special day is just that it streamlines to the health department that the biggest issue was that all the health codes were really covered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1073.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the where the bollards are and where the placement and all that stuff I think that it you know it could we could we find a way to streamline it and say that permits that are on that are in safe areas and in on city grounds because if you if you look at most of them<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1097.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that come before us, they're at the schools, they're at the shell, they're at the different parks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1106.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's a way that we can just put some language in that ordinance that we don't have to bring in 16 different parties just to make sure that we can accommodate these vendors for special events without<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1124.164s">[Scarpelli]</a>: keep picking at this and making it more than it really is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1127.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1262.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so again, that's not if I'm sorry, sorry to interrupt point of information, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1280.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, do you have a point of information?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1283.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, just, I think the biggest, our biggest, you know, the understanding is that the food truck, the food truck ordinance, even if it was on school grounds, it still comes to us because our protection of brick and mortar, the school department doesn't, you know, we've already gone over this with the solicitor years ago, that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1305.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that they don't have the right we have as the city council this is why we we had it in the first place is to make sure we protected our brick and mortar buildings and school department that's like saying the school department can offer uh free um have every every saturday have um food truck alley at at uh at uh the brooks and um and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1333.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that leaves our brick and mortar and West Medford Square left without any business for that week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1339.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I respectfully disagree with our council just to make sure I don't wanna lose the most important piece here, which is protecting our brick and mortar businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1448.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So be careful, because this is going to bring us all the way back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2018.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, point of information with that, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2027.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry that I'm not there, but this is gonna bring us all the way back to the beginning because this was what we explained to our business community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2037.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the reason why we went this way is because of that safeguard that they knew that this council would make sure we were protecting our brick and mortar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2047.859s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we now leave this open to other entities to come in and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2055.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: do special permits every Saturday, and it's allowed in separate departments, whether it's the parks department saying that we'll use Placestead Park to do something, you know, and it just leaves it to a slippery slope, and it's going to open up that, you know, it's going to open up that can of worms again that we started years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2077.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I just think that we should be very careful as we move forward with this now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2082.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2137.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Mr. President,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2140.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2143.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think having the authority to issue the special permit under the city council gave us that safety and that sense of understanding and acceptance with our brick and mortar businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2161.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But now as we're trying to find a more streamlined way to help our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2167.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: help our citizens that programs that want that one day permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2174.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we take the special permit out of the city council and leave it to the board of health, then we lose that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2181.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We lose that sense of control where our business and our business districts and have entrusted us when we first started this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2194.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2561.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2562.048s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With all due respect to the representative council from KP Law, I think we're talking right now two separate issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2571.671s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And for the sake of public finance, I say that we stop and reevaluate as a council and put this in order so it can be presented with all of the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2587.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm a little shocked that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2589.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that how we presented it maybe this was our fault by not presenting all the documentations from the beginning of this process but this isn't something that started in 2022 or 23 with with the brooks school this started years before that and making sure that that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2608.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the understanding that the council is the authority that distributes the or votes on the special permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2619.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I'm going to say this again to make sure all our new councils understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2623.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This was a gigantic issue with our business community, a brick and mortar community that was very, very controversial, very intense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2633.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I just don't want to continue this dialogue because we're, I think we're talking two totally different, different things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2640.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe the council is focused on one piece of this, this, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2646.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this request that we asked for, but we're missing the whole beginning of the race.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2653.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're doing right now is finishing the race.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2655.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just missed the first 23 miles of the Boston Marathon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2658.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't want to continue this for the sake of funding reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2665.477s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2666.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, attorneys are a lot of money and we can sit there for another two hours talking about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2671.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, uh, I'll do requests that would motion that we, we, um, table this and until we regroup as a council and get all of the information that the attorney on record is, is, um, is given so we can make a, a decision without, without stirring up the, uh, the business community again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2693.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=3720.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Great, so motion of Vice President Collins to- Great, on the motion of Vice President Collins, seconded by?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=13.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=45.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=99.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=100.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was informed of this wonderful news that we have two amazing Method residents that are sharing their 70th wedding anniversary, and I wanted just to express our deepest happiness for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=117.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know that they have three very proud children, Josie, Janet, and Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=123.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They wanted to make sure that their parents were recognized and just an amazing accomplishment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=129.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And 70 years cheesy, that is something to really to applaud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=136.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just wanted to share that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=137.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=159.02s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=299.963s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=383.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=385.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=473.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1434.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1436.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1910.93s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you, Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1913.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is, again, a very popular location and it looks like everything is in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1920.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will move approval after we hear from any questions from my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2064.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I question the chair on the ruling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2068.768s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I vote no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4573.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4574.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I will share the probably the only comment that I agree with the mayor is that an override should go to the community, but if it's done right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4589.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Last meeting, I posed a question about using free cash and showing the process so everybody could see what it does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4600.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And just for the fact that the possibility, now maybe the mayor can answer this, in November, Madam Mayor, if the override happens to fail, what happens to our school department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4630.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You usually are, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4657.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4659.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we would take that gamble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4661.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's what we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4663.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll revert back to June 20th of last year during the budget meeting, when I'm sure you remember the meeting that you had with both Councilor Bears and President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4675.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as Councilor Bears stated before, it's in the minutes, it's in the video that Councilor Bears met with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4684.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: behind closed doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4686.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you came to an agreement and he's going to vote for the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4691.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we did was you sold your soul because what you did is I felt like Nostradamus because as I said that night, what you're doing is going to put our city and financial ruins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4705.076s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4706.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4707.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the fact that when we look at where we are today,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4710.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and what we talked about back a year ago, we've had one year knowing that this was gonna happen and what was created to make this less harsh for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4724.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4727.582s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You started a financial task force of you, the chief of staff, Council President Bears, Councilor Collins,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4738.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe vice chair Graham and the chief of staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4743.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That is our financial team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4748.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I talked to neighbor communities as they lunged into these proposition two and a half, I talked to Mayor Curtatone, who informed me back in 2009 when they faced the same situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4762.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is what neighbor communities do for, I believe the word's been thrown out there, transparent, which I think is an absolute farce being used that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4772.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What they did back in 2009 to that community, they set up a financial advisory committee provided with expert advice from both savings and revenue production measures designed to help the city maintain its financial strength and face this deepening economics recession.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4789.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They looked at a committee which had Samuel Tyler, president of the Boston Municipal Research Bureau of Free Assistance, Jonathan Sloan, the president and co-CEO of Century Bank, Jeffrey Hartigan, senior vice president investments of UBS Financial Services, the Chamber of Commerce and leadership team from their financial team, and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4818.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Daniel Richards, Professor Daniel Richards at Tufts University and in the economics department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4825.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what I've been saying, that we might need an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4830.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We might need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4832.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But why divide the community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4833.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why gamble our future, our kids' future, by not doing it properly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4838.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what do we do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4840.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We met behind closed doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4841.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You sat in the meeting since I believe Councilor Bears said September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4846.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've had meetings that we've had no updates, no minutes, no notes, nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4850.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Bears stated that when we get closer, he will give us all the information possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4859.065s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we've got, we got a message from yourself that we are now going to just jump into an override, jump into debt exclusions, and jump into very, very scary times for a lot of very vulnerable residents in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4875.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Of course, when I asked for debt exclusion, I worked with the best financial mind in Aleesha Nunley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4881.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You remember her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4882.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Aleesha Nunley, who was an award-winning budget creator,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4889.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: she was, and when she broke it down for us, we eliminated senior citizens, and we eliminated veterans to see what that exclusion looked like for new fire stations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4901.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the numbers were drastically different, but we were making sure we were taking care of the most vulnerable members of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4908.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I asked for the other day was, when I was unceremoniously ruled 21,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4915.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and made quiet again, because what I was saying made sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4920.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Taking that money, five to $7 million out of free cash, and balancing the budget, and then working together by being more transparent and open in the process of an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4931.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You mentioned that the process, that looking at the process, it's only $440 a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4944.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, that's minimal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4945.272s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure, that sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4948.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what's scaring our residents, maybe you're not listening to them or even hearing them, especially our most vulnerable, when you're looking at a transfer tax that was mentioned, rent control that was mentioned, a registry fee that was mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4962.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about a debt exclusion for a fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4968.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's probably $250 million debt exclusion for a new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4972.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who does that fall on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4975.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our homeowners, and a lot of these homeowners that some of my colleagues think that are rich because they own a home of a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4984.159s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I'll give you an example of a person I talked to today, and when she said, George, I'm gonna be honest, this scares me, because her and her husband bought their home in Medford 60 years ago for minimal money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4998.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now their home's worth a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5001.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that million dollars now, because of the tax rate, now these little add-ons, as you called it, they're just small, as they keep adding on, these most vulnerable members of our community are petrified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5014.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They fear where we're going with this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5018.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I would have asked you, Madam Mayor, is looking at the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5023.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and where we've been in the last five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5026.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What have we done to create new growth?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5028.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What have we truly done to create revenue to support our streets, our sidewalks, our schools, our fire, our police?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5036.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What have we done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5037.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've had 340B projects that you turned your nose to that they've all walked away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5042.868s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Millions of dollars, millions of dollars in revenue through tax and through permits and fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5051.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Millions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5052.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just that alone in three projects that we know of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5056.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we look at this process, this is a total farce when you look at what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5062.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We look at the different processes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5065.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And like I mentioned, here we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5070.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This was mentioned on Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5073.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is probably the biggest, biggest motion, resolution to come in front of this council ever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5082.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Ever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5084.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we have no meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5085.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't talked about this as a council, community, and not once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5090.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we've had five meetings on a newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5096.65s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when you're talking about affecting thousands of people, thousands of homeowners, we haven't had any discussions, except for you and your financial task force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5107.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That doesn't seem like a financial task force at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5110.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because what it reads is what it reads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5112.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if it walks like a duck, it smells like a duck, it's a duck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5115.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You guys went in the back room, and you found the easiest way so you could be let off the hook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5121.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that is by debt exclusion to override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5125.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's a shame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5127.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That is a shame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5129.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I showed you what other communities do, what they've done in the past, and how it works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5135.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked to the superintendent who came up and talked to us about making it whole, and her saying that, no, it's not going to make it whole for what we talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5143.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I believe Vice Chair Graham mentioned to one of the city council, I believe Intoppa,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5151.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When he asked the question, if we get to 79 million, will everything be put whole?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5155.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She said, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5157.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The superintendent sat in front of us and said, absolutely not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5161.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's gonna take more money, just like you will, and put it into a black hole that we don't know where it's going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5169.571s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the proof is in the pudding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5172.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our numbers aren't very good, Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5175.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we look at our education numbers, we don't look good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5179.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not doing well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5180.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we provided more funding to the school department above all other departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5187.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not to say we don't need more, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5190.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it's how it's managed right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5192.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a weak question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5195.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate the dog and pony show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5199.18s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate everybody patting each other on the back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5201.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this was a complete joke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5203.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Lack of transparency, lack of communication with all members of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5209.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I'll say it again, I don't disagree that we might need an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5215.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I say that from the get-go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5217.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what we haven't done is we haven't done this together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5222.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What you've done tonight, if you caused enough divide in our community, Madam Mayor, we are now divided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5228.651s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I will tell you, I've had hundreds of people call me on both ends, 100 people saying, George, we need an override, and having great discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5236.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I've also had hundreds of phone calls from people that are saying, no, this isn't good, and we're gonna fight on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5244.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So instead of sitting there together as a group,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5248.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and putting it together and figure out the best course transparently, what we can do for our community, we didn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5255.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: On June 20th, you sold your soul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5261.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This task force was put together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5266.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You sat here doing nothing, because you knew this was going to be nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5268.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm glad you could smile, miss, because you're really affecting hundreds of people's lives here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5273.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then you come out and come out out of all this work, not knowing what you did, for overrides, debt exclusions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5283.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, I will invoke Rule 21, which states<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5295.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: dispositions of all items appearing on the city council agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5299.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All items of business appearing upon council agenda shall be taken up in the order their parents and fully openly debates the disposal of by vote of council previous to the consideration of any other item of business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5312.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No item of business shall be referred to committee except for the following reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5317.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for the study and the report of subsequent meeting, for the purpose of drafting an ordinance, and the event that open discussions may prove damaging to the character and reputation of a person or persons, all matters referred to the committee shall reappear on the council agenda for the meeting for four weeks following the referral, unless sooner presented by the committee chair or a majority not exceeding two weeks is voted by the council upon request of the committee chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5344.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: majority committee memberships.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5346.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any financial paper appearing on the council agenda for the first time shall be automatically laid on the table for one week when such action is requested by any member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5357.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now you might've suspended the rules, but I want the community to realize you stifled me last time disrespectfully shutting down rule 21 because I made sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5370.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and it was a viable way for us to slow things down and do it the right way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5375.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then tonight, you suspend the motion for this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5379.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well I invoke rule 21 this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5383.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if I have to, I would look into contacting our attorney and looking for an injunction to see where this goes, because I think this is a fraudulent process by the president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5394.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7005.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7008.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate the dialogue back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7013.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just a quick note to the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7015.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The presentation you just gave was the same presentation we heard at the debate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7021.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, no shovel in the ground, no money in our accounts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7026.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done nothing at Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7028.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done nothing in Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7032.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And councilor Tseng, immediate funding is available when you start these projects and permits and fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7039.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But my biggest issue I'm having here is not the fact that, because people are gonna leave tonight saying councilor Scarpelli is against an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7048.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, that's not what I, I've said this a thousand times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7052.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And councilor Callahan said, democracy is so important, getting the vote out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7057.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I agree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7060.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But why behind closed doors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7062.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why weren't we involved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7065.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why would you announce it on a Friday and then bring it to the floor on a Tuesday and then vote?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7073.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Especially when there are viable options that we know of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7077.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Free cash is there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7080.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You can use the five to seven to do everything you said to pull in the hot strings of all the parents and kids and teachers who, by the way, are my friends, my relatives, my family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7090.373s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I understand completely, but there's an option there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7093.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then maybe step back and say, well, instead of dividing this, instead of making this a contentious situation, let's sit together and say, well, did we look at the process of eliminating seniors to this process and how much would it cost us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7108.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did we look at eliminating veterans from the process and see how much would it cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7112.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7115.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Democracy isn't saying that six people in one room say it's all right and that's the way we should do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7122.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's democracy, no that isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7124.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Democracy is being open and honest and being truly transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7130.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about looking at where the funding was and where the funding's gonna go because when I say the black hole, I say we were given millions and millions of dollars from ARPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7143.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what do we do with it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7144.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing to show for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7145.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Infrastructure needs, it was the airport, nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7148.518s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You could get angry all you want, Madam Mayor, and turn your head, but you made some pretty snide comments tonight, and it's pretty embarrassing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7154.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you, I will tell you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7158.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You put on this paper, excuse me, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7163.582s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've talked about, Madam, I believe you said it was that we needed to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7171.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the people that were getting jobs illegally or questionable, and you were cleaning up City Hall, you've used that comment a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7183.316s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I tell you what, I'd like to sit down at these meetings and say, well, look what they've done in other communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7188.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Where did the funding go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7189.842s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why are we here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7190.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And how do we fix it moving forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7193.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What have we used in consultants, Madam Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7195.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What have we used for investigators, Madam Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7198.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What have we spent on for legal fees in the hundreds of thousands?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7204.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What have we used in settlements?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7207.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are millions of dollars that we wasted because you put a cape on and thought that was your job, and that wasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7214.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the courts, obviously now we're hearing it and we're seeing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7218.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will be honest with you, again, it would have been nice to have some time to sit with the community and figure out, or at least all the council, because it seems like six people know what they're doing in the council, but there's one person sitting back saying, well, I had questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7236.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had things to offer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7238.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I came out and started sharing that on the council floor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7244.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was pushed by asking me to put the amendment first, then I was asked to verify comments, and then when it started getting heavy and it started making sense, we sectioned 21-me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7258.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now we get to tonight where I think we do need breathing room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7262.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need another week to look at this, to look at this and ask some questions and make sure people, through the democracy, the process of democracy, that people ask these questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7274.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you can pat yourselves on the back all you want of this task force, and you came to this agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7279.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But to present all the information from this hardworking task force that was presented to the public on a Thursday or Friday, and then brought out for a vote tonight, is a disgrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7292.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's really, this isn't the way democracy works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7296.373s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know if you, deep down inside, I think all of you know it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7301.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, Mr. President,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7305.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that a lot of people do want to speak, and again, I'm just going to leave off with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7310.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had a mechanism in place that could have taken care of our children, our teachers, our parents, all these coaches and teachers that you're looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7319.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: through free cash, which we had millions because of the process that was mismanagement of finances in our community for the last five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7328.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And an abundance of that much money is just bringing it back to who deserves it, and that's the taxpayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7333.93s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Remember, that's the taxpayers' money that weren't spent correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7338.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now we have an option now to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7342.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And instead of doing that, we're gonna rush through a vote tonight, which it's sad to say I will vote no, not for the fact that Councilor Scarpelli doesn't think that we possibly could use an override, but we didn't do it the correct way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7357.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We did it behind closed doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7359.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whether you wanna say it was a great process, whether you wanna say it was transparent, it wasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7366.579s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7419.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still have no city solicitor, Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7460.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whatever puts you to sleep, Madam Mayor, every night, that's a shame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7463.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I sat next to you for four years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7467.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7467.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I respect you, then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7471.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7476.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I just want to remember.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7479.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want the mayor to remember that I remember that person that sat next to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7484.247s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And she wouldn't deal with what's going on right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7486.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So shame on you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7488.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whatever puts you to sleep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7830.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, if I can point a personal privilege.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7834.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7835.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll say this to all due respect, whatever Mr. President makes my colleague feel good, but what he did was stifle the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7844.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was very clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7845.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You asked questions as the chair of the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7849.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I answered your questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7850.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You did not rule it out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7852.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We move forward with the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7854.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when it started getting uncomfortable, my colleague ruled to shut me down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7859.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7860.907s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why I shut it down tonight is because it just doesn't matter because the process is already through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7870.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What you're asking for, and what I was asking for, was never entertained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7875.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It couldn't have been entertained, Mr. Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7880.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if I said what I needed to say tonight, it would have needed time for the administration to look into that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7886.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For instance,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7888.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: looking at an override and taking senior citizens out of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7893.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know Councilor Collins has mentioned over and over again, that's transparent and there were notes and all due respect for the vice president, Mr. President, those not the questions that we had, or I had, or the people that I represent had out of those meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7911.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because what we had was the options of doing A, B, or C.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7915.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But with those options comes processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7918.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For instance, we need an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7922.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, were there any other options?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7924.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, if we did do an override, what would it look like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7929.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what my questions were going to be driven through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7935.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8590.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Mr. President, uh, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8594.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when I asked for debt exclusion, the finance director at the time, Aleesha Nunley did a study that excluded our seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8604.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And my comment tonight would have been through the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8609.766s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It would have been interesting to see before we got to this point, if seniors could have been excluded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8617.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, uh, but I, I believe there's council bears says it's, it's a mass law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8622.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe there is a process that you can work with the state to get that exempt by the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8627.917s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14300.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can you repeat that again, Council President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14301.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14332.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14366.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14372.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14422.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14545.805s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14595.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14747.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15185.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam Vice Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15189.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I also appreciate the resolution because it definitely is something that we should understand and with a little compassion, but to what relates to the proposed site, I think it's also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15212.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: conversations I've had with former addicts and, um, and people that were once on methadone that really stressed to me that, uh, the location is, um, is something that should be looked at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15226.855s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, um, to help the city find a location, um, that would be suitable, but, um, in the area that's being requested where it's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15238.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a few blocks from the school, across the street from the dance studio, a park right down the block.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15245.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there are some concerns there for the residents and the parents of the Roberts school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15254.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that has to come into play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15257.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15259.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, like again, this isn't coming arbitrarily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15262.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is coming from discussions that I've had with, uh, with addicts themselves and who've, who've told me that it should be in a place because, uh, there are some serious concerns there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15275.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, although I appreciate my fellow council bringing this forward and I feel for, uh, and respect, um, a resolution at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15286.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh, in the same breath is understanding that, um, having the location in part of the community that could negatively affect so many, um, we have to look at their well being as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15301.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, I thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16944.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16946.11s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NkdSQu8o7Y4&t=91.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nobody was against the process of helping people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NkdSQu8o7Y4&t=96.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what everybody was looking for was making sure that this facility or a facility like this would be put in a location where it didn't affect residential inhabitants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1477.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam Vice Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1480.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1481.304s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm really excited about the direction we're going into because we hear a lot of, you know, why can't Medford move forward and going through the reclassification, I think that the zoning and understanding the changes we haven't had in so long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1494.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think what we're seeing, especially in the last couple of weeks with one of the zoning issues, one of the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1502.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: one of the placements of a very volatile issue we talk about what we've seen is we've seen neighborhoods now get more involved and I'm so happy that one of the biggest things we talked about setting up those teams that are going to go right into the neighborhoods that are really going to talk to those neighbors<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1522.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and get their input to see what we're looking for as a community, what they want in their front door and their backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1528.698s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my only thing is, as we get started, I know that, you know, is how we're gonna get the word out to, you know, when that time comes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1537.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's not for now, but I just wanted to share how excited I am that we're moving through this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1541.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know it's a lot of work with a lot of good people, and I'm really excited about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1545.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as we move forward, I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1548.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The piece that we're seeing now is that community really getting involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1552.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was part of the, I was working in Somerville at the time when Somerville did their rezoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1558.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the mayor at the time really had every department deeply involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1564.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we went from,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1568.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, from square to square and neighborhood to neighborhood, we had everybody represented, every department there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1575.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when the community members had an input, we were taking our fluorescent orange dots and putting it to where they thought was relevant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1582.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that really helped us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1584.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: put together and zone their neighborhoods and be part of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1589.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm very excited about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1591.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just wanna thank you for all your hard work and I'm gonna need bigger glasses for those bigger bullets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1596.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=2975.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just a small question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=2976.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When do you think these maps are going to be available online in PDF format?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=3202.692s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=677.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=680.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Every community should have a Tom Lincoln.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=682.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I admire Tom for his conviction of what he believes in, and Tom was the person that fought for what he believed in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=691.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if anybody wants to know why the Brooks Estates is still standing and why it's still a great piece of our community, it's because of Tom Lincoln.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=701.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I can't wait to see him and shake his hand and thank him because he put a lot of time and effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=708.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are many, many nights that we would butt heads and not agree, but we would always respect each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=717.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I admire what he did for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=720.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And hopefully someone's ready to pick up that torch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=723.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Tom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=947.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's say some nice things So we have known your family a long time and I just want to commend you and thank you and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=964.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's people like Sylvia that kept Medford moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=967.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know people think today's times might be a little difficult, but I remember some really tough times in Medford, and it's the people that made this building what it was and what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=980.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's people like yourself that I personally am gonna miss, and it's like, I think that it's a piece of history that'll be walking out the door, but at the same time, you left a legacy here that I hope<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1846.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wanna thank Mrs. Lasky because I had the honor not only to be a parent of a child in her class, but also a colleague.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1855.474s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you were the pinnacle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1859.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You were what everybody wanted to aspire to as colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1863.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you never, you never wavered in your emotions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1872.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You were just a great teacher<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1875.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You were there for every single child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1877.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know the impact you made in my child's life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1880.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, dad's an elected official, but my son could care less about politics until he ran for fourth grade president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1890.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he woke up one morning with a suit on and he says, dad, can you hold this behind me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1895.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said, what is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1896.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He said, it's American flag.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1897.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, what are you going to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1898.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He says, I'm going to give my speech with someone holding the American flag behind me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1902.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, how come you didn't carry it with what dad's doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1906.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He says, you weren't in Miss Lasky's class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1908.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to Justin's point, I remember when he came home one day, he met Mr. Lasky and he says, I know what I want to do for my future, dad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1918.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said, why, what do you want to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1919.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He says, I met Mr. Lasky, and I want to be the reason why we clean Mystic the lake so we can all swim.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1927.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And just those impacts that we made, the growth and respect to our environment, the little lessons that became huge lessons today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1941.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I thank you from the bottom of my heart because it takes a village to raise your children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1944.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we were very fortunate, the Scarpelli household, to have you as one of our children's teachers and teaching them from right and wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1952.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1954.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You earned the retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1956.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know there's a huge void at the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1958.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I remember when we started, that was the A-Team, remember?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1961.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to be in the same breath<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1963.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as you know, I think was by default with my position, but to be in the same breath as when they called the 18 and talk and stand side by side with Don Alaska gave me a sense of pride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1973.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1974.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for all your work and enjoy the retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1978.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2015.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would like, if we can, Mr. President, is bring Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2017.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Lasky back, and we send her off with one of those wonderful citations that you draw up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2024.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2024.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That'd be great if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2025.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2026.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe invite the whole Lasky family, because I know we haven't seen them for a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2031.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2132.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2133.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We recently lost an amazing person from an amazing Medford family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2141.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had Lauren Kane passed away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2143.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those people that didn't know Lauren, Lauren was an unassuming but very powerful figure in our community for the fact when being a police officer, a female police officer, wasn't the norm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2161.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: she took that job with such pride and such vigor that she started as a young person, as a teacher, and then moved on to be a police officer, and then moved on to hold<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2173.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to hold huge positions with the drug enforcement team and making sure that she played a huge impact in making sure that drugs weren't being distributed to our youth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2189.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And she worked for the DEA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2191.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She worked for the city of Cambridge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2193.221s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And most of all, she worked here for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2196.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, it's a sad day for, uh, the method police department that they lost one of their own and, uh, she will definitely be missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2205.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would ask that we send our condolences to the cane family for, um, for a person who really gave her life for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2214.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, um, we may she rest in peace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2217.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2556.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2837.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2838.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So first I want to commend the neighbors and the residents that really pulled together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2845.509s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what you see in front of you is what happens when you see that something might affect our neighborhood in a negative way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2855.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I found amazing is I went to an organization, a group of neighbors put together a meeting at the Fireman's Club, and I think probably about 130 people showed up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2866.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we heard from everybody there with respect and honor to every individual involved was that nobody was against the process of helping people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2879.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what everybody was looking for is making sure that this facility or a facility like this would be put in a location where it didn't affect residential neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2894.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's amazing to see the community rally around this and really start a grassroots quick organization to really rally around and just educate people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2906.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's what's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2908.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we have, what I realized in those conversations, there were some people very angry at George Scapelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2915.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and deservedly so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2918.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is something that we talked about with our leadership team here that when we did the recodification of our zoning and we implemented these type of facilities in the medical field, in the zoning process, that it was then going to go to a special permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2937.714s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We realized the impact it could have now legally<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2942.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with the facility like a methadone, and people keep saying clinic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2947.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what really brought a lot of people to their feet was it's not a clinic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2950.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There weren't people there to assist people that were addicted, but it was just a distribution site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2958.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2959.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had people that were involved that were both former recovering addicts, and we talked to administrators in the field, and they really shared an input that really educated a lot of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2974.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, at the end of the discussion, it wasn't that, let's keep these people out of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2980.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, it was, if it's needed in Medford, let's find a location where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2986.164s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they can get their help and the support, but at the same time not affect a residential area that's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2992.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Feeds away from a dance studio, a school, the lack of parking in that area affecting small businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3001.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there were a lot of little intricacies that played a huge part in what that neighborhood, the effects it would have had in the Salem Street neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3012.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I commend the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3012.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I had some issues because we wanted to make sure that without a city solicitor, I reached out to the mayor this weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3023.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She had an attorney that's well-versed in these topics to call me to make sure that we didn't say something that would get us in trouble later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3033.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that with this motion,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3037.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as this process started moving forward, you saw that everybody was listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3042.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You saw that every department in the city was listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3045.362s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor was listening, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3047.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The Board of Appeals said, one of the biggest questions was, well, how do we make this a hybrid meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3053.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because there are people that couldn't make a Zoom meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3056.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So making it, opening it up to everybody in the community so everybody had an input in this decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3066.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My motion tonight would still be for a moratorium moving forward, but working directly with Mrs. Hunt and the mayor's office and making sure that we look at our zoning to make sure that any<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3084.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any facilities under this criteria are moved into non-residential areas where it won't affect our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3093.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, there's still a process, but that would be my recommendation and my resolution if we can, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3101.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the meetings are hybrid, so everybody can still attend those meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3108.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3109.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I can't thank<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3114.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This sometimes is elected official, you look back and you say, geez, with this process, sometimes being a politician, you get, you know, your colleagues have one way of thinking, you have another way of thinking, and kind of get a little discouraged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3127.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But one thing you do know is that you all love the city of Medford, and we're all fighting for the right reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3134.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what I saw<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3136.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this past week with community members rallying together to make sure everybody was heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3143.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I loved, there was, you know, I'm getting phone calls from young people that have young children in the schools that just moved to Method a few years ago, but in the same breath, they were<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3156.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: introducing me to their 88-year-old neighbor that they were making sure that they felt comfortable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3161.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what's amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3163.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We really took care of our neighbors with this situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3166.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I'm going to say this again because we talked about this issue too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3171.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This wasn't to divide at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3172.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that people are looking at social media and saying, this part of the city is saying, suck it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3177.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This part of the city is saying this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3179.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These people are saying that, you know, shame on you for not wanting to take care of people that need support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3185.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was never the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3187.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With everybody I talked to, it was an open mind, but with the goal of making sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3193.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These types of facilities are located in the community that doesn't affect our residential neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3201.512s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I give them all the respect and pats on the back that they deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3209.636s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate this company that realized that maybe this isn't the way to go and didn't want to continue with the fight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3223.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For now, Salem Street is in a better place right now because there were a lot of issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3230.855s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it wasn't just what people would think that with the methadone distribution site coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3237.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People were concerned about the parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3239.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People were concerned about the small businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3243.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And people were concerned about that whole corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3245.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that it was really expressed in a mature, responsible,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3253.304s">[Scarpelli]</a>: diplomatic and not divisional conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3258.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3259.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I will tell you, I am so impressed with, and as I move forward, I'll put a motion through Mr. President later on, that we convene a community engagement committee that brings in the talent we have in our community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3279.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, there are some amazing people that are in the field of addiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3286.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are amazing people that are engineers, and there's amazing people that work with traffic studies, and there are doctors, and there are legal minds that really came out and shared their expertise for the greater good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3302.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not to be negative, not to go one way or the other, but really to share an opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3308.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I commend everybody here for being here and following through with something that they knew that was going to impact their neighborhood and this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3316.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm glad to see that a wrong is righted and we'll be working hopefully after we pass this resolution that we work with the mayor's office and the community development team and really try to change that zoning so we're not in this position again that we're making sure that if it's needed then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3337.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we'll have a location where it's not gonna impact the community like it has in last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3341.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3343.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3951.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to clear clarity with the Council, if I can, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3957.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we have the Council, we have a representative that the city had hired to work directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3965.575s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want to make sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3967.717s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I, what I put in as a motion is legally, um, you know, acceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3973.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to put something in that's going to negatively affect that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4129.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, if we could just move forward and send this to the subcommittee in zoning and we stop the process as soon as we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4148.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I think we eliminate the moratorium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4150.663s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've taken that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4151.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we restructure the motion to ask to refer this to the zoning, our subcommittee in zoning to draw up the legal and proper terminology to move this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4165.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4222.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry, can you give us some guidance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4223.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we have residents that have worked very hard on this issue that want to be heard tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4228.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If there's a possibility that they can express their input and their time and effort they put into this, I would recommend or ask that you would allow them to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4251.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so if you want to speak on this, you'll have to wait at the end now to public participation, and you can speak on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4589.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we're in a good place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4592.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think this is productive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4593.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're in a recess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=4594.364s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=8238.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=10550.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just wanted to make that a point that was mentioned, questioned by a few residents via phone calls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=10561.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=10571.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I make the motion that we approve the special permit and with the 30, 60, 90 day review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11184.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11186.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, and I appreciate all your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11188.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that when we are committed to support the CPA, I think that there's some clarity maybe you can help with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11194.424s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that when we first voted for this, it was a matching number by the state, correct, at the time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11202.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It still is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11203.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have we seen that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11204.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we getting that money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11205.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We receive it every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11207.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Every year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11207.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And how much is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11242.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's 14% this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11249.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12813.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12813.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scrivner?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12816.621s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for all your work, Tom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12817.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12818.368s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the questions that residents called me and they're just concerned that yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12823.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, and I appreciate the developers and having that control, but the conversations I had with a few neighbors that here are a few homes that aren't in the historical realm, and they would need approval to change the color of their house or a window frame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12842.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what they've told me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12843.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So maybe we can dispel those rumors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12883.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so that's, with developers, listen, I support this and I understand what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12889.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that what I'm hearing is just the neighbors that are saying, what's recommended for materials if they had to make a change in their home and they're living on a fixed income.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12902.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and how that could relate to their processes if they needed something to be remodeled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12907.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's the biggest concern and where it falls in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12911.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that really hasn't been delineated for, okay, this home was built in 1974 and they want to replace some windows and the windows might not fit in the criteria that we might be looking at with the commission, but it's affordable for the family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12931.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: sure so i think that that's my biggest concern with this i don't think that i've heard that it we've been saying that it's been recommended but if they say no what are the ramifications um well i was gonna put this on the slide but but but um we've actually never said no okay<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12957.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But how long are you going to be there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12962.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12977.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12978.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I like I said, I think that what you're doing and what we're doing that in that neighborhood for years, I mean, and I know that, you know, for my friend sharing music, who is a strong proponent and former former school commember with myself and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12993.459s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, I know the passion she had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12994.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's not like I said, it's not, this isn't something that I would talk against because of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12999.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that the biggest piece is that everyone has the neighbors that are concerned that many people have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13044.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate you and I appreciate who's here right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13047.424s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My fear is if we're putting the disordinates in, it's the next group that comes in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13051.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If they come in and they have a hard line and they're like, no, we're not gonna do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13054.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, you get to control who.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13058.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, no, we don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14808.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14810.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Last week, I know we had a very informative meeting on the budget a few weeks ago when we talked about the processes and where this money is coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14820.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we voted for an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14826.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and an override that put forth the onus on the children in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14835.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I put forth a recommendation to look at free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14840.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We then noticed that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14845.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We were informed that in this packet that we've now have $9 million added to that free cash to roughly $34 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14853.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm curious, when you went through this process, did the financial task force identify, did they know about that $9 million as it's going forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14877.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so I know that my fellow councils, we have five money papers in front of us, and they, I believe, what was it you implemented?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14891.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the rules to avoid Rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14896.794s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will do this with all the papers tonight, but as my right, I'm invoking state law under Chapter 43, Section 22, which reads, Section 22, any ordinance or order or resolution may be passed through all stages of legislation at one session, provided that no member of the Council objects thereto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14917.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If any member of the council objects, the measure shall be postponed for that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14921.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm going to vote that right for the fact that we're pushing things through and we're not getting the information, at least this council is not getting the information they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14930.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's a tactic that's very silly that we're going to try to get information that was passed, that was information that was given to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14939.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I made sure that we reached out to the state legal department and they said, any budget paper,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14946.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If this is invoked, our ordinance is invoked, then I can supersede that with the state ordinance until I, as one city council,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14955.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: who finds this process so faulty, and so smelling with the lack of transparency, that we're so confused of where this money is coming from,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14970.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and I've used this many, many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14973.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're all very bright people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14975.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not saying anybody's doing anything illegal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14979.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm telling you this is financial mismanagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14981.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We asked for a $7.5 million override on the fare of our families and children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14987.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wanted to propose a $5 million free cash proposal that eliminate that fare, then the community can look to see whether we need an override or not, which I wouldn't oppose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14998.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But instead, we required it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15001.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was stifled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15003.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we moved to the next meeting, which was the budget meeting, and we had similar questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15009.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now we move to the next meeting, we come up with $9 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15014.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have $34 million in free cash, with an override still hanging out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15021.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we still nervous about the kids in the schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15023.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I have the right to invoke this rule, and I do so, and I will do with all money papers tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15029.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15045.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been instructed by legal industry that this is a money paper that I can implement at my disposal, in my discretion, and I do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15055.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I question the chair, if you wanna stretch this out even longer,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15067.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I am opposing rule 22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15085.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, I have it in front of me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15086.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15087.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15089.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You want to play the game, so I'm playing the game with you guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15092.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know, I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15093.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because it's kind of funny that when you want to talk about information, I've implemented my right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15157.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if you want, I've questioned the chair, I've put in the rule moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15183.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not debatable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15184.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The rule is not debatable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15186.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It doesn't apply.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15187.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, remember.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15190.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you pulled this last week, I did my due diligence to make sure that the information is getting out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15195.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's funny, we can have five meetings in subcommittee about a newsletter, but you wanna take these motions on money papers and force it down people's throat without giving it its due diligence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15207.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Shame on all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15306.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll text you, Ken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15307.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15308.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But that's a disgrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15313.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have any of you talked to the administration for $9 million?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15320.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The 20, the July.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15325.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You agree to call on Bob anytime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18136.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2956.763s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=110.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=111.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a sad day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=115.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when we heard the passing of probably one of the finest teachers to ever grace the hallways in the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=125.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Robin Irving was a very special person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=129.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She made it her life's mission to take care of our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=133.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's over 40 years of service, and Robin fought the fight against cancer and lost her battle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=145.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's ironic that today's her 70th birthday, and I know that the family has put together a GoFundMe page to make sure her name carries on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=155.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in her name to scholarships for deserving children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=157.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I wanted to mention that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=160.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She was an amazing person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=162.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had many friends that had Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=165.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Irving, and when they talked about Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=168.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Irving, as if they had a mother out of their home, someone that took care of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=173.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then when I was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=177.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: awarded the position to be a McGlynn Elementary Phys Ed teacher, I was honored to work on the other side of the door of Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=185.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Irving's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=186.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if you ever went by Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=187.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Irving's room, you know that she was a teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=194.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She had everything she needed for every kid with every single lesson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=200.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And she was tough, there was times she was tough, but everybody respected her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=205.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when we heard the sad news, I'm not less of a man to say, but I cried in my truck because she was one of the good ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=215.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And just wanted to reach out to her family, especially her nieces and nephews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=222.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know how much she loved them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=226.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And send our deepest condolences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=228.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a person that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=231.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you wanna name a library after, or you wanna name, leave someone's name to show their legacy, Robin Irving's the teacher that deserves that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=244.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So goodbye, my friend, happy birthday, my friend, and thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=252.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=658.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: President Bears?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=732.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=734.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The point of my resolution is very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=738.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This Councilman and I use the words transparency and accountability very often, and I do too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=743.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These words count.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=747.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: at the count only if we not only talk the talk, but we walk the walk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=752.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As this City Council is well aware, I submitted a letter to the Attorney General and the State Auditor's Office expressing my concerns over the way the City Council has used Rule 21 in Mass General Law, C-43, Section 22, unfairly and in a self-serving way to eliminate the discussion of resolutions that call for the expenditure of millions upon millions of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=780.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When papers from the mayor were before the city council on June 7th, the council suspended the rules and approved the motion that the council rule 21 not be allowed to be invoked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=792.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then on June 25th, my request to invoke Mass General Law C-43, section 22, which allows any one council to postpone consideration of a paper for one week was ruled out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=807.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At both of those meetings, my hope was that we could have an appropriate amount of time to discuss these significant issues and also receive input from our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=818.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When the council leadership ruled my request out of order, I had no choice but to bring this to the attention of the proper state offices to receive their input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=829.739s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The state auditor's office responded to me quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=833.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and reviewed my requests and explained first the requirements of the majority of the city council and the agreement of the mayor to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=841.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So here's the simple part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=844.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If this council feels confident that its actions of those two meetings were correct, then your confidence in your actions can be reflected in your yes vote to allow this review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=858.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That would be true transparency and accountability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=861.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If however, you're not confident that the council's action were correct, you should still vote yes for this review because then we will have guidance from the state as opposed to an opinion bought and paid for by attorneys hired by the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=877.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That would be true transparency and accountability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=880.93s">[Scarpelli]</a>: However, if you vote no on this resolution, it will show the residents of our city that this council uses the words transparency and accountability as a punchline that is empty and deceptive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=896.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now is the time to stand up for what you say you believe in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=902.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: let everyone know the only thing greater than your hollow words is your cowardice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=907.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will tell you, I will ask as a form of a motion that we vote to send this to be reviewed by the auditor, state auditor's office to look at our finances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=920.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, again, I'll say it publicly again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=922.868s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have not one time mentioned<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=926.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that there is someone doing something illegal with the city's funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=929.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My questions have been and stymied for one factor, one factor only, financial mismanagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=939.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I move that question, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1213.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1639.105s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let me make it very clear then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1643.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In both the letter and in the resolution, I asked for examination on everything possible, period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1650.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, I want the examination of our city finances, and I'll be meeting tomorrow with the Attorney General's office and talking about the legalities of the processes we have here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1664.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, it's funny, Mr. President, that my fellow Councilors mentioned some pretty outrageous comments, like as this was something that wouldn't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1677.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1679.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The last four meetings,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1684.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe you don't have YouTube, but Councilor Lennon made sure everybody knows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1688.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our meetings are on YouTube now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1690.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Watch those meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1692.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's funny, Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1694.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You tell me about working together and council rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1699.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's funny that you talk about disagreements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1703.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Of course we've had disagreements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1705.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And of course we sat across an issue and one lost and one won.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1709.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Of course they did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1710.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But never, ever, ever has a sitting council been silenced the way this council has silenced me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1725.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: no different than Councilor Callahan speaking about, it seems to fit the narrative whenever it suits your mission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1735.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I remember when we had an issue concerning a legality dealing with a newsletter, and I said something very simple in regards also to the letter that was sent out to the state regarding the transfer tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1751.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1753.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I made a motion that we ask for an opinion from our legal team here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1757.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe you voted no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1759.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe all of you voted no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1762.544s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that stymied the talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1764.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That stymied the process that you yourself just said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1770.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you sit back and you start talking and you're spewing to the public that this is divisive, that this isn't true, oh, these are all true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1780.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These aren't made up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1783.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You suspended the rules so rule 21 could not be invoked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1790.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We were talking about millions and millions of dollars that this council got on a Friday and voted on a Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1799.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that what you talk about transparency and accountability?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1802.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1803.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And instead of walking it through with this open, deliberate conversation, as you just well stated, we did it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1811.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We shut it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1813.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We disrespected this councilor and my ability to work for not the 7,000 people,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1822.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not for the 7,000 people that elected you when you knocked on their doors, but when I put my hand up and I swore to uphold the rules and regulations and laws of this city, I represent all 60,000 members of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1843.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to sit back and spew this disingenuine dialogue that these are lies, that what I'm saying is mistruths, these are situations risen on the fact that you, as the leadership team of this council, you stymied the process of open discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1863.272s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1865.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You forced me to go out and ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1868.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In regards to my fellow Councilor reaching out to the art of his office, great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1874.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I forwarded our city clerk the email that was sent, so I could share that with everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1881.236s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When did you forward that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1882.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, just now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1882.716s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just got it, so I just forwarded it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1884.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good morning, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1886.719s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for your correspondence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1888.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In order for our office to examine these issues, we would need the request for the city of Medford itself, and then it broke down, which Councilor Callahan so eloquently said, it's the vote of the council,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1901.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then it's the vote of the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1903.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And yes, the city would have to pay for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1906.92s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And oh, by the way, yes, the city does do an audit every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1914.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The questions that I would have brought up that evening and the previous meetings before that, that I was silenced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1920.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We looked at situations where we had millions of dollars in other avenues that we can make our school system whole to protect our students, our teachers, and our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1930.351s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I was stunned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1932.331s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then the following week, we got the email, right, that we just found another $9 million, $9 million in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1943.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $34 million in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1945.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there's an opportunity to openly discuss, transparently, with accountability, discuss this process and say, where did it come from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1955.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How did this happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1958.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why can't we use this to support the education process now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1962.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because what has happened, maybe you stick with your 7,000 people you knock on their doors, but you've woken up this community to the fact that whether you believed in an override or you didn't, people are questioning this community's process of fiscal mismanagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1981.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1990.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to call this, sorry, not Council President, to call these allegations, I think it's just disingenuine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1997.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These aren't allegations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1999.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What you're saying in actuality, what I put out there, what I've tried to say for the last four meetings were lies and I made them up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2009.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's simply not true, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2011.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm ashamed that you even brought that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2013.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You could go to every single meeting and watch it yourself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2017.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And all I had were questions that my constituents, our constituents in the city of Medford, were asking me for answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2027.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And all it could have been, even that evening, when we questioned yours and Council President Bezos' signatures with your titles on that letter that supported a transfer tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2039.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All that could have been done was a simple yes vote, voted to legal, them telling me this is what it is, Councilor Scarpelli, and we moved forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2048.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I have an answer for multiple constituents that called me about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2053.574s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No different than this situation or what we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2058.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You made it a mockery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2060.247s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The night of the budget was a mockery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2062.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You want to talk about a disgrace in a Zoom, in a show?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2065.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was a show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2067.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mail with the snide comments and the linking back and forth, disgusting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2072.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Disgusting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2073.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Look at the video.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2074.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You guys look perplexed like this never happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2077.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Go back to YouTube and watch it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2080.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Go ahead and watch it because it's disgusting and it's appalling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2083.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to sit back and call this, these allegations,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2088.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I protested that vehemently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2091.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are truths.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2093.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you forced me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2102.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I made the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2104.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We sent the letter to the attorney general and the auditor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2108.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The attorney general hasn't gotten back to me yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2109.842s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll meet him tomorrow, we hope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2113.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The auditor's office responded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2117.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The response that I got that I shared explained the hows and the what to dos with this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2127.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why this motion has come up that we vote on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2132.705s">[Scarpelli]</a>: passing this over to the mayor, having the mayor make a decision, sending it to the auditor's office, and then having them come in to look and see, not what the audit that we're seeing done when everything is prepared, but at the end of the year, when we find $9 million of mismanagement funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2152.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's unheard of, because as most people in this administration love to do, they contact neighborhood communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2159.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They love to put these charts up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2161.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I did that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2163.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The average increase in free cash in neighboring communities are no more than $4 to $5 million, and that's excessive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2171.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're looking at $34 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2176.005s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you people stifled me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2178.487s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You shut me down that we couldn't talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2182.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those aren't allegations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2184.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those are truths.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2185.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know hate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2186.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know they hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2188.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know when this comes out, I know that it hurts me, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2193.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It hurts me because I was voted just like all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2197.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I was voted, but when I took the seat, I made sure whether a person agreed with me or not, that I made a decision what I think was best for the whole community, all 60,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2210.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But from what we hear from my fellow councilors, that's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2213.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will tell you this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2215.64s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This will move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2217.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll go to a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2218.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think I'm very clear on the vote now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2220.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's examination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2221.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the motion to have the auditor, this council, to vote to allow the state to come in and put through an audit through the state to see where we are and what's been happening with our funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2235.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2236.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, moving forward with the Attorney General's office, we'll see what they say about the management and the style that this Council President used over the last few weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2250.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That has been an absolute atrocious display of leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2254.364s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that'll come out in the next meeting, and I'll make sure I'm a little clearer for everybody when the Attorney General answers those questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2262.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2263.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2281.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You got the letter the morning I sent it through the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2284.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you saw that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2285.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you saw that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2286.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the response from the, the response from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2292.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The auditor, I had it this week, and I forwarded tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2297.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You forwarded at what time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2299.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, just now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2300.233s">[Scarpelli]</a>: During the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2301.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, just now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2301.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2304.076s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, so that's what you're going to win on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2305.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If that's how you're going to play the gutter ball, you've got me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2308.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm just asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2308.839s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've got me, bud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2309.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2310.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You got me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2354.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Don't use my name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2355.681s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of personal privilege.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2357.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the law between the doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2358.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of personal privilege.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2360.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You use my name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2362.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You use my name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2363.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will answer it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2364.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You said that evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2366.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a point of personal privilege.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2368.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You obviously don't know who you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2370.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2371.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2372.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please recognize the law that indicates that I'm the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2375.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2447.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When not, I'm going to Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2837.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Sen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2838.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3484.907s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3486.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just to address a couple of the comments that people use my name directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3490.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: On that first meeting, when we started the discussion talking about possibly using the free cash and being stymied, and then stopping that conversation because we all knew the process the following week would be the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3509.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The next meeting would be to talk about the budget and possibly vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3515.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we attended the next following meeting, which allows me to then discuss that resolution that I put forth, I took it off the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3527.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I took it off the table to eliminate the nonsense that was already passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3537.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The idea to send a resolution through and explain the resolution, the option of thought process of one Councilor, who by the way,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3546.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: understands that sometimes it's inconvenient for people that come to a vote to 100 people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3553.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when you have the responsibility of thousands of people and making sure that we're doing our due diligence with all of the finances and all the financial questions we have, that I took it off the table because it was too late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3571.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My motion that was presented the week before was to discuss the process so we can sit with the mayor and understand the process and get some answers so we can move it forward one way or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3584.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But that was stymied, that was stopped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3587.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it wasn't that I stopped that meeting because of lack of transparency or didn't want to openly discuss something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3596.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was a moot point, we moved on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3599.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Anything I said there eliminated anything we could do because the mayor was ready to move on her votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3606.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So understand that, that's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3610.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know, let me share some shocking, sometimes the administration doesn't tell us the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3622.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you realize that even though you rushed the vote, even though we realized we got information about finances no more than a few days prior to that, that there were still multiple layoffs and we lost many, many teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3639.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that was a lie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3644.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was not an option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3646.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We could have waited and move this out a week after and got the information that all of our citizens wanted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3652.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: not the 200 people that were here that found babysitters, but everybody, that's our responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3659.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we didn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3662.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You made a choice to service the people that service you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3668.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's blatant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3671.165s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You talk about, Councilor Tseng talks about just picking up the phone, call the departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3679.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't trust the departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3685.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They work for the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3688.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I say I don't trust the departments, I speak with the rank and file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3694.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they privately talk to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3698.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we can't use their names because they're afraid of what goes up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3702.34s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not throwing fuel on a fire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3705.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You asked the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3707.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You brought up the question why I simply didn't go to these department heads and talk to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3712.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3714.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The key words in my resolution are transparency and accountability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3720.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if I want something to be transparent, I'm going to bring it up here in front of all of these people so they all understand the process, not sit in a director's office that they can appease your agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3736.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because that's what we're seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3738.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because you said it yourself,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3740.768s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You said it yourself, that was a very important meeting for the override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3744.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was a very important meeting during the budget to get that approved because there was fear that teachers were gonna be laid off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3753.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Simply not the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3756.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, this is a simple, simple resolution as I said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3765.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is just to send this off to the auditor and get,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3770.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a true indication of what the financial mismanagement that I see and others see, that we get the answers that are needed and required as we move forward, especially when you're talking about what you were asking for in November, when you talk about overrides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3785.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because it's very important that we get the message out so everybody doesn't make a decision out of anger or lack of knowledge or lack of what was done during the budget season, because that's what it lends to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3801.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what it lends to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3803.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Say whatever you want, but that's what it lends to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3807.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is why this community is so divided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3811.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't, this is just one council standing up to make sure that the whole community is listened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3819.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not the 200 people that showed up for meeting and they were gonna be inconvenienced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3823.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because honestly, I know all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3826.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know you're very bright people and we've talked a lot<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3830.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if I talked to you privately and I said, realistically, y'all given information about $9 million on a Friday, without talking to anybody, even okay, we talked to the directors, but then we go to move on a vote on a Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3849.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Truly, that is definitely not enough time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3851.768s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been doing this long enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3853.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not enough time to get the answers that this community deserves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3859.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3862.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what was said tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3865.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure, this is the process of the council, and the process of the council, you went through with the letter of the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3872.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You motioned it, you voted it, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3876.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you, say what you want, Council Vance, we worked together, and the council's working together in the room right now, broke a rule that we can use against transparency and open dialogue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3888.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Never would have done that to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3889.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You might have lost the vote,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3892.142s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You might have lost the vote, but it was understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3894.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And same here, hey, when I sit and I lose a vote, I take it and move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3899.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But to be stymied, that's not acceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4475.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4480.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any further discussion by members of the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4483.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, I just have one comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4484.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4486.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just to expand on what Councilor Callahan mentioned about the process and how everybody was here that night and they were so excited about the override and giving the voice to the people first time voting on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4504.429s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you remember the conversation and if you remember the dialogue that was set forth in my motions,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4511.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: was the fact that we had a financial task force that we didn't see or understand how they got to that situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4522.766s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't see how they showed us why we need an override, what got us to that override, and what are we gonna do in the next steps to make sure that we don't need another override the following year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4534.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are the questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4535.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a transparent process that we were asking for that evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4540.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And of course people came up and voted for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4542.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And of course they want to be told that we should go on to vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4546.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4548.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But you're not listening to the people that are right in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4552.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As many of those people that came up and said, we're for it, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4557.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have the same amount of people that are telling you right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4560.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're not listening to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4562.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But you're not hearing them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4564.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I find it a little disturbing that the process of silencing or discussing or transparency or accountability would have come out in those meetings and discussions<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4576.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when we had the opportunity before the votes came out and understood, okay, the financial task force met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4585.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: no minutes, no understanding how they got to where they did, but we're gonna come out with a $7.5 million override, a $30 million debt exclusion, which by the way, you're gonna be shocked when the firefighters come knocking pretty soon, and the understanding that not just a week later, we find $9 million more in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4611.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That alone, if that doesn't open your eyes and say, well, geez, Councilor Scarpelli, eliminate all the negative banter, eliminate one side or the other, geez, that's exactly what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4622.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And yeah, maybe we should look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4627.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even though, Councilor Tseng said it, you just said it, people came to that podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4631.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Of course they were in favor of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4633.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the problem was the people that had questions weren't listened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4638.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a lack of transparency and accountability, my friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4641.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the problem we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4643.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4646.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you might be confused in the verbiage that I'm sending the auditor, but let me simplify it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4651.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm asking the auditor, with our vote,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4657.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to look at our city's finances, period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4662.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll move forward with the Attorney General after I speak with them tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4666.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe they have something to share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4668.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this isn't a very difficult, you can make this a convoluted resolution and be very confusing just because you wanna sign it, but it's a very, to everybody, it's a very simple process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4679.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My resolution states that we ask the state auditor by a city council vote and then the mayor's approval<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4685.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to come in and look at the city's finances because I question the process of millions of dollars in free cash and the process of how we got to certain votes when it comes to a financial task force that didn't have minutes to explain to the public what's happened to this community financially, period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4707.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4707.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4833.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, one more last comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4838.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I bring this point up so we can all understand this, that one of my number one motives of moving to free cash<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4847.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and not leaving it up to a vote, is that during subcommittee, a resident asked a very poignant, moving question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4856.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What happens if the override fails?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4861.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council Bear stated, it'll be absolutely devastating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4865.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There'll be massive layoffs in our education process, not word for word, Council President, but it'll be a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4874.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My process was saying, why gamble right now with a total future and not using the free cash that we had in front of us, and then work together as a community to look at other options, but we didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5340.168s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Donna, are you there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5358.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Eileen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5368.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Eileen, I'm requesting to unmute you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5457.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, um, jessica healy full lock road i'm just wondering why there's really even a Issue with having an outside auditor come in from the state I supported a hundred percent And we did just hear from a lawyer who also agrees so i'm not sure why this Has been such a big deal and all this arguing over just having someone come in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5483.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that use our tax money and pay them to do an audit to be very transparent and put everything to rest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5490.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think everyone would just like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5493.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5904.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council President, if I can, just to clarify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5912.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5914.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5916.51s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we've talked about the audit that's done every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5920.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The process that, the piece that we really would benefit from, from the state audit, isn't just, the audit that we get every year is the figure, the money line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5932.717s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it comes out, like I said, I don't question<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5936.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: whether it's being used fraudulently in the sense that it's illegal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5941.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My questions I have, and something that the state auditor's office will do, is audit the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5947.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not only the figure, but the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5950.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what we're seeing with being the biggest issue right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5953.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the audit comes in and they say, yep, all the numbers add up when you add up the numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5958.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when the year is over, when the year is over and the mayor presents $9 million,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5964.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The process has to be investigated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5966.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6031.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This council might've known, but the financial team, they definitely knew there was $9 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=831.766s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, just we change the ownership, everything is same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4455.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4456.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that you've worked very hard on this, but a lot of people have still reached out saying they just don't know, since we've moved some places around, they were curious how they can really know where they're supposed to vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4468.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is there a number or an office that I can direct them to and that we can maybe send something out publicly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4523.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a great idea if we can get like a robocall to those residents to say, don't forget your new location or there's a lot of people it's funny because conversations that we have a big state state representative Donato has a big.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4538.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: big race coming up in September, September 3rd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4542.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And a lot of people are really coming back out that haven't voted since the last presidential race.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4547.429s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's where the questions arose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4550.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate that, if we can get that word out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4553.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think the other thing was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4555.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that with that race, is it district, Middlesex District?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4561.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 35, what is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4565.223s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We really, I think the other question is that people don't know that September is the election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4572.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There is no November with this race, because there isn't a Republican, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4576.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There will be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4598.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the two will go in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4600.695s">[Scarpelli]</a>: OK, that's confusing, because now we were told that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4643.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4644.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I understand that, but I think people, people think that let's, let's skip the primary and we'll vote in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4652.571s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In November, there'll be no race.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4654.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It'll just be the, there'll be the candidate that came out of the primary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4680.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's why I think that this is something that educating our voters and getting something out part of that 3-1-1 is making them understand that there is no Republican<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4693.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: party running in this race.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4695.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So in essence, the winner that comes out of the Democratic primary will be our representative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4700.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have to, it is very confusing as you just saw.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4704.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it would be imperative that maybe we, as a form of a motion, we ask the election department and the mayor and the city administration<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4716.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: share a robocall throughout that district, those districts that are affected, that they understand that November is really just ceremonial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4726.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not the actual election for that race is the third of September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4732.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4761.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Mr. President, this is what's terrible about not having a city solicitor, because I think this is a message that truly needs to be detailed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4770.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think, well, it's for all three candidates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4773.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not political.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4774.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's to make sure that everybody knows for all three candidates that you have a constituent that's going to vote for one of the three candidates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4782.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they assume that they're in the assumption that we'll just vote in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4786.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the truth of the matter is not understanding the processes we just saw.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4791.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that letting them know that September is truly the election for this seat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4796.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't think it's, I'm not saying one party or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4799.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm saying for all three parties that are running for that seat should be given the respect and the effort by this body to ask if we can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4809.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, again, like I said, if we had a city solicitor, be very simple and say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4813.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: let's make weapons city solicitor let's let's do that let's send it off as a b paper and we'll we'll get to that when we can but having it stop right now i think it's it's it's not it's not right it's not right all right uh that's fine i'm just what's the text of the b paper<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4830.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We would like the elections department in the mayor's office to work with a robocall and other messaging, whatever other messaging possible to reach that district that is voting in the, once again, I'm sorry, District 30.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4843.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The 35th Middlesex.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4846.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the state representative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4847.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have three candidates to educate those voters on the importance of that race being the final representation of that position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4864.16s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Does that make sense, Mr. Clerk?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4867.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that you're very good at fixing my mistakes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4912.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the September 3rd race, the September primary being the, right, yes, good, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5088.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5089.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Mr. President, another point with that, if I'm right, if I'm correct or wrong, I know that if there isn't a Republican candidate that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5098.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I, a registered Republican can't, what is it, they report to the elections office to ask to, is it unenrolled so they can vote in that election?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5129.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You say, well, I want to vote as a Democrat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5132.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's important that people that don't have a candidate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5136.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in this district that are registered Republicans can come to the elections office and ask to be unenrolled so they can vote as a Democrat?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5150.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a technical question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5151.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, so that's something if we can ask you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5208.486s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, that's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5504.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5506.651s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I appreciate Council President bringing his resolution forward, but in the past week and a half, we've been getting multiple phone calls from the residents in the Fulton Heights area, which is odd for road infestation, considering we live in a ledge, and you don't have, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5528.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, too many business districts in that area that promote rodents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5533.261s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we're seeing that over the last few years, we've tried, we've talked, I know the director of the health department has made efforts to try to stymie the rodent infestation issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5547.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've even moved to put in ordinances that allow<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5554.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: allow us to go on to private property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5556.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we see nesting and try to do, we have to do more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5561.417s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I've had a few phone calls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5563.579s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the curbside composting is a great initiative, but you're seeing the fear that even though they can't open the lid, they're eating through the bottom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5574.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5576.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there are questions that I think as we move forward that we need to now get more in depth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5582.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You see neighbor communities put together subcommittees and special task force that work directly with professionals from local colleges and local pest control companies and try to find different avenues to stop or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5603.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or slow this process down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5604.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that my motion would be, Mr. President, is that we would convene a meeting with the health department, the mayor's office, the inspectional services, and the DPW to try to craft a task force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5621.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know Boston's calling it the rodent czar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5625.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that Metro has to do something more to figure out the process in stopping this huge health scare that's growing across the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5639.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that what we're seeing is the different<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5648.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: different forms of control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5651.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that some of them at one time worked to feed the catch basins to make sure that the rodents couldn't reproduce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5660.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It wasn't the fact that they were horribly destroying rats all over the community, but they were making sure that they were stopping so they couldn't reproduce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5669.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's gotta be something more being done other than calling the health department,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5675.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: which, by the way, we don't have enough staff to service the needs that we have right now, to then call the exterminator, come out to put bait boxes down and leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5686.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5687.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my recommendation is that we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5690.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5690.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the work that we've done, the Council President's done with a few members of the community with Tufts Medical in that area, but it's just not that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5701.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's time that now that we have Tufts involved in this area, well, let's come together, let's pull everybody together, and let's find a solution for the whole community and how we can attack this problem, because it's only gonna get worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5713.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7672.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7675.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you'll allow me, over the past few years, I've heard many people talk about the legal claims or settlements or court judgments that have been paid by the city or school department for claims made against the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7688.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the school department or employees of the city or the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7692.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yet many of these claims and settlements that have been mentioned have never come before this council, either for an appropriation of money for payment or just to inform us about the claims.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7706.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Going back to a time even before I was on the council, I know that the council had to approve the expenditures of any amount that was over $2,500.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7714.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The purpose of this resolution is for the council to be made aware of the expenditures to settle or pay for various claims made against the city, the school, or any of our employees of the city or our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7731.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My motivation to bring this resolution forward is based on a very simple principle that I'm sure my colleagues can agree with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7737.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That is, expenditures of the city revenue is always a matter of accountability, transparency, and good government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7745.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People deserve to know where municipal dollars are being spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7748.507s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With this in mind, I ask for the support of my colleagues on this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7753.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, as we said tonight, I know that we mentioned just tonight, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7757.171s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We said we need more funding, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7760.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need more funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7762.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we've seen over the last couple of months, we've seen a blatant financial mismanagement of our city's finances, as witnessed with the $9 million of free cash that was recently certified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7777.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The lack of new growth in our community over the past four years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7781.584s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Payments to outside councils that we still have yet to find what the true numbers are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7786.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And lastly, the settlements that mostly are unfunded by the city leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7792.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is very important because it's another aspect that week after week we're coming forward and that we're seeing mismanagement of our city funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7804.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, I get it, there are things that we can't talk about legally, and there are things that might go in an executive session to protect certain laws, and I get that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7815.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But there is a lot of money, from what I've heard, from different department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7820.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like we mentioned the other day, that you just go and speak to the department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7825.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, the department heads aren't gonna tell you the truth, because they work for the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7829.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So like I've said in the past, I've talked to rank and file members that have really shared with me some insight, and it's horrifying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7840.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's frightening where we're looking at maybe five or $10,000 hit here or there with a legal issue, and we never hear anything about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7852.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, I'm glad we have a representative here tonight because I have some questions that I was gonna leave as a resolution, but maybe you can help with, Mr. Salt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7863.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that as a representative of the teamsters and our employees here at the city, you know, even the most simple things, an arbitration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7873.671s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If an arbitration is heard, I'd like to know who pays for those arbitrations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7877.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to know how the attorneys are paid, both sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7881.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: not just the outcome, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7884.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because we still haven't heard the outcome of many things, which we know to avoid the rumor mill, just to get this information from the mayor would be so important, just so we can understand and we could share this with our public and saying, you know, hey,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7903.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In the last couple of months, especially last month, we've seen some pretty disgusting processes in how we've run the finances in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7911.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, we've seen that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7914.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's public knowledge, but this is another aspect that I think needs to be opened so the community can see<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7926.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: why we don't have the funding needed for extra help in the health department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7932.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7934.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7936.999s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8593.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8595.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this, I agree with my councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8599.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a simple request that, again, do transparency, accountability, have the mayor present to us what I've requested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8608.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think it's a simple, it eliminates that outside talk, but then again, it shows<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8613.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if it's something that the community, the taxpayers in this community need to identify that this could be an issue, then it's their right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8621.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I welcome your support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8624.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, I know Councilor Bears said whatever we budget is appropriate and whatever that is, but when you look at the numbers, just as Mr. Seltz just presented, there's some numbers in there that I don't remember going in that room and approving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8637.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, again, this is why we asked, I put this motion forward to ask the mayor for detailed answers in, you know, redacting names or whatnot, but actually showing us that these are real stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8652.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are real lawsuits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8655.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what's already been settled are real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8657.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those, a lot of those aren't private anymore, they're public record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8661.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would ask the mayor to present to us that fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8665.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I say mismanagement, when you hear these stories and whether they're fact or not, let's see if they're fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8671.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If they're fact, then we could discuss something else that's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8676.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what we're paying for our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8681.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: our insurance, our premiums for our settlements, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8686.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What does that increase?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8686.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What have we paid?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8687.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, when we say mismanaging $9 million, it's a matter of opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8691.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My opinion and the people that I've spoke with, when you are in crisis, fiscal crisis, and you're calling with a financial task force to come out to call for an override, but then just a week later ask,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8707.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: expressed that we just we just certified $9 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8710.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's $9 million of taxpayers money that wasn't used properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8716.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So in definition to myself, whether you want to take it or not, it's fiscal mismanagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8721.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You do not manage<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8723.579s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that money responsibly, and that's the taxpayers' money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8727.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, yeah, there are a lot of things that have come up in the last couple of weeks that we need clarity as we move forward with the agenda presented by my colleagues in the mayor to see<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8740.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: where we're going, what direction this community is going, how we got there, and how we don't get there ever again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8745.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a lot of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8746.705s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is just a piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8747.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all I'm asking, is to support the resolution, let the mayor present the information that's needed, and we can move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8754.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9086.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I truly understand what he's saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9087.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'm thinking,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9089.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My take and the comment, the question is that, why wouldn't someone put a foyer in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9094.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If that's the case, they can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9102.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: maybe, but as the governing body, is a governing body that it's my responsibility that if I have a question, why would I have someone else put a FOIA request in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9114.261s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We would ask the city, we would ask the mayor for, as I've done with the resolution, with hopefully with the support of the council, that the mayor gets us the information that I requested just to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9126.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: just to show the answer to the questions under transparency and accountability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9654.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're seeing settlements, but we're not appropriating, we're not voting on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9659.466s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Anything over $2,500, we should be voting on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9663.407s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we're talking about the settlements, we're talking about insurance, we talk about attorney fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9668.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are the things that I want to show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9670.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't say monopoly money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9671.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'm saying is real money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9672.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't say you did, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9673.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, no, I'm saying it's real money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9675.532s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's taxpayers' money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9676.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's why this resolution's come about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9678.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whether Council Beals was strayed off of what the bigger picture is, maybe I should have stayed focused on this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9686.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I really think common sense, eyes wide open, we can see that there's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9693.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's, and again, I'm not saying fraudulent, I'm not saying illegal, I'm saying mismanagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9698.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're seeing the way the city is spending our money, it's fraudulent, it's non-transparent, and there's no accountability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9713.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9760.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Glad you can see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9763.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a huge gaps in what's going on in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9765.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we could just see what spreadsheet, you know, the ones that our chief of staff council president mentioned, let's let's talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9775.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because we talked about KP law, and they came here during the budget season, and openly said we only spend $50,000 on KP law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9780.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9782.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But using that example, when I counted up those months, it came up almost $500,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9787.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's not totally what was in other departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9792.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there are questions that this isn't a conspiracy theory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9797.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are questions that I brought up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9799.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are concrete issues that we have that we want answers from the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9804.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've asked for an audit to do this for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9806.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've asked for transparency and accountability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9809.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the form that we're asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9812.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: move to the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9814.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's get the answers from the mayor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9816.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hopefully she does what she's supposed to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9818.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And like Councilor Leming said, that's a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9821.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If she doesn't do it, I hope someone in the audience files a form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9825.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=11595.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=11599.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just wanted to thank Mr. Bader, this morning I talked to, we had some questions that residents had and the reason why<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=11606.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In the past, I voted no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=11608.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that the questions that were asked by those residents and were clear in those answers, and I shared those answers to those residents that reached out, and I'm in full support with the process as we speak, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=402.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=403.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, it seems like I do this way too often when we talk about Medford residents that leave an impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=413.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Medford lost one of their favorite sons, Frank Zizzo,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=420.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Frank leaves behind his amazing wife, Dorothy, and his children, Frankie Jr., Kerry, and son, Tyler.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=428.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that a great family man, loves his grandchildren.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=433.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you watch, follow him on Facebook, you realize what kind of an amazing person he is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=438.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Grandfather, father, and Method Mustang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=444.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He dedicated his life to make sure that kids in our community got what they needed, especially at the hockey rink when it came to Medford Youth Hockey, and especially when it wasn't that popular, our female youth, our female girls program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=460.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He really helped build that program and Medford is sad,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=467.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for his loss and really would like to send our deepest condolences to the Zizo family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=473.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he's the type of person that has left a legacy that not too many people will forget if you knew him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=480.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And those who didn't should ask about him because it's someone that you want to, you want to remember or at least know his name because he's that, he was that much of an impactful person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=492.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=496.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=537.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=538.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that with so much, so much devastation happening across the world, we seem to sometimes forget the pain and suffering that we felt here in our country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=551.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: back in 2001.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=552.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's a day that everybody will remember where they were and left such an impact in everybody's lives that we should never forget September 11, 2001.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=562.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=567.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what that did to society and what it did to our world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=570.297s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And remember all those people that perished that day and beyond because of the cleanup and you see the frontline workers that are passing now that worked on the rubble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=588.666s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's an impact that we still feel today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=590.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that we should never forget that day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=592.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, and, uh, it's something that I'd make the motion for a moment of silence for this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=597.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1954.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can open it and then I could fill in the blanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1996.584s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1998.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Three o'clock in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2000.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, that's not happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2002.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will, I will tell you, I think that when you look at the neighbors, unfortunately you do a butt neighbors, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2007.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Across the street, you have, you have families and homes across the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2011.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, I think we can be very fair to look at what we've done historically for neighboring businesses with the idea of competition and fairness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2023.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will, Council President, I did ask for a report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2027.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I haven't heard back from the building office for inspections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2032.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm actually gonna ask to move this to a date certain, but I wanted to make sure we spoke<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2038.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: tonight because I wanted to get a report back to see if we've had any concerns or issues in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2044.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that it's important that we understand that, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2050.509s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Three o'clock in the morning is a little excessive and I think that that's when you're looking at what neighboring restaurants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2057.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we've given some permits or some options till I believe one o'clock in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2062.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But after that, I don't as one counts I would never entertain if people want that late late hours for anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2070.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For consumption, I think they can go into a business district and outside the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2076.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think any resident, to be honest with you, this councilor, the three o'clock is just unreasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2082.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why we have the special permit in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2084.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we have a week to revisit it, to be honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2089.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the latest we have is one o'clock in the morning for some restaurants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2094.313s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, even that to me is a little questionable because you are across the street from some homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2099.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's something I'll have to really think of before I make my vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2105.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that before we do anything this evening, I'm going to ask to, after everybody adds any information or questions they have, but I'll be looking to move this to get a report back from the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2120.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the building department to see with any complaints or issuances that have happened in that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2126.93s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not just your location, I'm not saying your location did anything wrong, I'm asking to see what's happening in that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2132.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they haven't, unfortunately, they're a little undermanned, and so no one got back to me in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2138.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So hopefully we get an answer, and then next meeting we'll have a clearer vision of what I can vote on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2146.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I thank you for being here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2500.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that the biggest issues we have is that when they do open the streets, not just, not your company, but we're seeing too many, too many jobs that are left half done, and it's creating more havoc when people leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2516.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think the biggest piece is having a curb-to-curb process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2521.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's something that, to me, as one councilor, is a non-negotiable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2527.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But from what I, just for clarification,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2531.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we saying that the roads that we're requesting, they will be paved curb to curb, but we're asking for other streets that are impacted to be repaved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2546.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just need some clarification on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2669.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, I too am a little leery of,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2673.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: of the impact that this will make not only for the increased costs that would be then put on our ratepayers within the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2685.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that because National Grid's not going to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2687.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not going to take it on the chin, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2688.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, it's going to be passed off somewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2691.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as I'm looking at it online, where we're looking at South Street and traversing down Main Street, I know exactly what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2701.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That median was already developed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2704.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was in front of the police station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2707.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that where?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2708.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's already been done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2711.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I could see your apprehension with that going across the street of the medium, because if I can ask the city engineer in this map and taking this route, even today, I didn't see, it didn't seem to be uneven or really damaged in that area on the other side of the medium anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2741.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: where we're seeing the work being done down South Street and all the way down Main Street, that is a no brainer of curb to curb, but that's something that I'd have to consider now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2754.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3668.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4161.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I thank Councilor Leming to look into this, but I think we need to be very careful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4166.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Neighborhood communities have looked at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4170.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the vision of development without a full comprehensive plan, and it's a good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4175.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it has to be looked at, but I think we better be careful in what, in totality, what we're doing in this community when you're looking for development and what we're asking for developers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4187.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're seeing impacts in neighboring communities where they had some similar issues and they thought would be great ideas, and instead what they did is they further pushed developers further away from the communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4199.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4200.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It really hurt neighboring communities with the fact that neighboring communities lost millions of dollars because of their processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4208.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think this is something that, you know, when Mayor McGlynn put this in place, he had the foresight to look at this and say, this is what we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4219.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why they set up a trust for each, how do they put it, that each,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4227.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: each stakeholder that within the city that would be impacted, the impacted departments, which would have been, I believe the school department, parks and recreation, DPW, water and sewer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4272.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4273.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I stand to say it was road and traffic, road and traffic linkage, parks and recreation linkage, police and fire linkage, water and sewer linkage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4283.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that the other question people had was this, are we going to be looking at small development of someone who was refurbishing their home or adding an addition?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4292.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, no, it would be for... This wouldn't change what linkage currently applies to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4298.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4298.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It would be with the special... Is it special...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4303.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: site plan review correct okay all right so i just like i said i think that uh understanding the history was important and i think that it does need to be looked at but i think that we should be very careful and you know without a real comprehensive plan that at least i haven't seen in what direction this city's going and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4324.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when it's growth and development, I think it's a little dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4327.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5064.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5065.526s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you very much for all your work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5066.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think these are the revenue generating projects that we're talking about and that the city can really use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5076.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And like we said, we're starting with one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5079.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as we see it starting to increase, I think it'll be important that we stay ahead of the kilowatt rate for the fact that we're seeing national grid never saw us<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5093.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're climbing at an outrageous rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5096.311s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So in making sure that we're competitive, but at the same time, we're offering something for convenience for our residents and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5108.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To be honest with you, I'm sure the gaps that people that are driving down 93 that need a charge, the nearest site comes right into Medford, right off the highway, and they use our station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5119.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I wouldn't mind that someone from a different community, a different state that needs to be charged, they come into Medford and help us with our bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5128.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5499.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Director Dickinson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5500.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5501.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5502.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5503.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is common practice, by the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5506.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Every municipality does this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5507.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's good practice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5514.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5520.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, I think that's a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5522.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For people to understand, I think that someone asked me a question, what does that mean, George?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5526.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, simply put,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5528.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you had your mortgage and it extended so long, you can revisit it with a better rate and rewrite that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5537.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's that simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5545.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're talking about bonds, it's a lot of money if we could save a percentage point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5548.719s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So yeah, I think this is good work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5563.258s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a teacher for the next 10 years or a police officer or a firefighter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5566.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5568.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate you had worked with that and I would support this, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5572.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=4162.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QjAOAB8_UUg&t=16.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm honored that a friend of ours who's worked so hard for firefighters to capture grants and take the pressure off our citizens and our tax base, Secretary for our union, Danielle Marcelino is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QjAOAB8_UUg&t=31.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Welcome, Danielle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QjAOAB8_UUg&t=251.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=15.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Tonight, we have to thank my team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=18.945s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's so many of them, but I want to thank everybody that's here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=21.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you're from all Medford, if you could just raise your hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=23.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just thanking you for being here tonight and helping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=26.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=31.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've had a few events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=32.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know tonight's a tough, tough night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=33.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we had about three different events tonight, but we said we need to do something because things are happening really quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=42.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the reason that we're here is because we wanted to talk about the Proposition 2.5 override and the debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=48.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there are three questions that will be on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=52.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll give you some more information later on after a few people speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=58.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But one is the debt exclusion, which is for a new fire headquarters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=66.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm very fortunate that we have one of our union leaders from the fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=71.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Danielle Masolino is going to be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=72.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's going to speak in a little while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=74.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And proud to say someone that I called and asked his opinion because I think he is probably<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=82.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the smartest educational mind, at least in Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=87.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's someone that I respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=89.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And sad to say, I don't think people respect him enough until that person's gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=94.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I called this gentleman and I asked him some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=99.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And within five minutes, you just feel better because he just educates you with his knowledge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=105.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I asked him if he can come out and spend a Friday night to come out and speak and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=111.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: give his opinion and what, you know, his perspective as an educational leader, someone that ran our school system for many, many years, still works at the state level, high level at the state, and he's gonna share some of his knowledge, and then we'll fill in some gaps that people had that had some questions, and we can help educate everybody so they understand what this means on November 7th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=134.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So right now, I'd like to introduce my friend Roy Belson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1393.264s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1479.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1834.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, President Beas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1837.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I did take some time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1839.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I contacted our code enforcement officer and like we thought, Panda Express is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1846.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: has done a great job with everything they do and above board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1851.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we really appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1852.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as I went through and talked to some neighbors, I think there's gotta be some consistency with our decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1862.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We voted to keep the permit, the hours of operations for Raising Cane, Dave's Hot Chicken,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1872.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then we have the wings wing stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1875.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think all of those restaurants and those establishments have a schedule from 11 o'clock to 11 11 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1884.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to 11 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1884.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and I think that we've heard for some neighbors that live directly across the street and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1893.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and that there are some residents in that area, unfortunately, directly across the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1898.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I wouldn't be able to support a special permit at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1903.169s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that under the umbrella of being consistent, respecting our neighbors and the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1914.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: past outcomes and decisions that we made for local establishments that are in that vicinity, I would recommend that we do not support a special permit at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1926.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2763.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you Councilor Bears, Councilor President Bears, and thanks Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2766.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's time to bring this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2769.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For someone who does manage this type of facility in neighboring communities, I think it's going to be important to get the cost analysis because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2781.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, community in financial crisis, as we are right now, looking at Porter parties at a lot of our facilities could be very, very, very expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2790.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, what would be what would be, uh, what we've done in, uh, in, in to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2798.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: hold the burden off our constituents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2801.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We kind of maybe want to look into neighboring city facilities that we can use in different areas instead of the port-a-potties in different locations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2815.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that might be something interesting to see if we could set up a map or a partnership with city facilities that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2821.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: residents that are using a certain park or location that they can use those sanitation facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2828.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, I will tell you it is a a huge expense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2833.719s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, it's a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2834.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And like I said, um, when we look at apples to apples that are coming up pretty soon, it's something that's gonna be interesting to see where we're going to tighten our belts as a city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2845.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2991.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3798.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3799.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3801.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I very well put Councilor Callahan, but to further to expound on the free cash is the essential, the amount of money communities have over-budgeted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3814.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And according to the Mass General Department of Revenue, free cash represents the amount of community funds that are unrestricted and avail of appropriation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3822.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For example, the city of Medford has not had a city solicitor for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3827.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that money would carry over year after year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3831.379s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Every year a salary from the city solicitor includes annual budget, because no one is receiving the salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3836.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The amounts of that, if we put aside, city solicitor's salary goes into the city's free cash reserve for the city administration, the mayor, to use as they please if they need so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3847.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So how does the community use its free cash?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3850.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Cities and towns in Massachusetts use free cash after it's certified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3853.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The Mass Department of Revenue is responsible for certifying free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3857.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: After a city or town submits its financial information to the Department of Revenue, a community will receive its notification, the total amount of free cash, which is certified, therefore available for appropriation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3869.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, does Medford have free cash?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3872.088s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3873.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Medford has free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3874.73s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As of September 10th, we were looking at a total of about $34 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3880.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is certified free cash, which means it's available to use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3884.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And especially in crises when you talk about underfunding a $5 million deficit in the school department, that's what that money could be used for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3893.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then with the vision of financial minds working together to see if there are other avenues that we should use other than overrides, I feel it would be prudent for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3907.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So most communities, the four and 5% that's been mentioned, most communities,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3913.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you see a two to maybe $3 million of free cash after every budget year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3919.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, you've consistently seen with this administration an absurd amount of money going into free cash because revenues were under projected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3929.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And maybe that's done for a reason, or maybe not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3933.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's something that we would love to know with more transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3937.088s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, this community, our community, our leadership team,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3942.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: haven't done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3943.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it leads us down a very, very slippery slope and it's dividing this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3948.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So while we have the free cash and have the opportunity to not put the fear mongering into the community about teacher cuts or school issues or our children, why not use the free cash and eliminate those fears and then sit down like we talked about in the past where I was shut down by this council to look at a more, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3970.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: transparent, open form of participation to see where we need to do these three things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3976.698s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One understanding how the city got to this financial situation to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3981.963s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How are we going to fix it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3983.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And three, what are we doing never to see this ever again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3987.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this council and this mayor and this administration haven't done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3991.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to ask for an override right now is just absolutely frightening, especially to the homeowners that are living on a fixed income that we're looking at possibly losing their homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4001.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So in the same vein as my fellow councilor asked to vote for the override, I'm going to implore to our residents that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4010.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is two different cases, two different stories, and it's going to be important so people can understand the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4017.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the truth is, the city has mismanaged its budgets and mismanaged its organization in the city for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4028.221s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we see this with a $9 million certified free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4035.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That is unheard of, my friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4037.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So yes, it is true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4039.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you do take money out of free cash, it could possibly hurt your bond rating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4044.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when you have $34 million, taking $5 million out to make sure our schools and our children have no fear of what might happen down the line, why wouldn't we do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4057.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4093.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, if I can, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4097.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I couldn't get my hand up fast enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4099.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can we sever this, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4100.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I think with the financial questions we have in our community, I would support the traffic motion, but I think that we would have to look at this separate piece as something we can hold off until after the override vote is taken because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4121.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we are in fiscal crisis and this vote is taken in November and it's voted down, this could be crucial money to assist for the fraudulent process that was put forth to us where we hear all these cuts going to be made in the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4137.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would request we would sever this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4139.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in a motion and then uh and really think twice before we vote on any money paper right now um dealing with um dealing with uh with any any project that doesn't have to do with safety or our children seniors so thank you that's a formal motion thank you sever is there a second on the motion to sever<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4528.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=19.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right now, for the November 5th ballot, we'll have question six, question seven, question eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=28.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Question six is a debt exclusion, like I explained, is a tax that you'll be taxed until the project or the bond is complete, and then it comes off the tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=40.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that reads,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=43.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That exclusion on fire station shall the city of Medford be allowed to exempt from the provisions of proposition two and a half, so-called the amounts required to pay for the bonds issued in order to pay for costs of construction, a new fire station headquarters to be located at 120 Main Street in Medford, including the payment of all costs related design, the project equipping and furnishing, the project site improvements and all other costs<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=72.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: incidental to related there too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=78.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you'll vote no, because that's been a lot of people's questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=82.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: George, I thought you supported the firefighters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=85.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, when you hear it straight from the people that I think Danielle put it perfectly when she said, we don't want to sound like the angry people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=96.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Instead, look to see what our firefighters have gone through, what our men and women have gone through in the last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=103.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and how they've been treated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=105.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And yet again, they're gonna stand up and say what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=109.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What you're offering was not transparent, was not inclusive, was a decision made in a box, and the funding is gonna hurt our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=122.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they're willing to stand up and say what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=126.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'd rather not have our residents of Medford hurt<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=132.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: financially for an inferior product.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=136.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please do not vote for question six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=141.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Danielle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=148.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Question seven is funding schools and street repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=155.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Shall the city of Medford be allowed to assess an additional 3.5 million in real estate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=161.368s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and personal property taxes for FY25 general operations of the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=167.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $3 million includes but not limited to funding costs for teachers, literacy coaches, behavior specialists, administrative assistants, nurses, and for regular facility maintenance and for FY25 general operations DPW, including but not limited<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=188.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to additional staff for road and sidewalk infrastructure repair for fiscal year beginning July 1, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=196.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, this question seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=202.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $500,000, come on, for the roads and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=207.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: ARPA, when it was originally put forth, was directly supposed to go to infrastructure needs, roads and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=220.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=222.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now we sit here and say we're going to give them $500.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=225.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=227.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is an issue that I put forth years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=230.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We tried to put a sidewalk and hot tub crew together to save the city money because the mayor kept coming to us for $2.5 million bonds for sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=242.258s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we never saw sidewalks being done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=244.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We could never catch up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=246.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know my colleagues say, see?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=248.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: See?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=248.78s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=249.16s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have no money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=250.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=252.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=254.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I love the dialogue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=261.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Public schools, teachers, literacy coaches, behavior specialists, nurses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=270.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The superintendent has already, the expert in the state has shared some amazing information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=280.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have we been resourceful?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=283.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Has the school committee and the school department been resourceful in creating revenue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=290.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=293.223s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know my colleagues will say, again, he's not telling the truth because their social media sites tell you that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=301.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I have shown everyone, very simple, meeting after meeting, and if you want to look up, watch them on YouTube,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=309.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: From step to step, we showed an avenue to come out of this without hurting kids or teachers or schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=318.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We showed them that avenue through free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=322.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what did they do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=325.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They imposed a rule to shut me up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=329.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=332.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One of our members got a phone call from a school kid member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=337.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that school kid member said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=339.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How dare you put a no sign on your lawn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=345.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are you going to be happy when we lay off 40 teachers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=348.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Shame on that person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=351.429s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because that's the same exact question I posed in the open meeting in front of everybody and said, why put the schools, the children, the teachers through this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=362.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Take the $5 million out of free cash,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=366.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: put the fear away, and then let's all get to the table and make the right decision for our community with an open and transparent process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=378.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that, ladies and gentlemen, question seven, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=391.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I like the drama behind this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=394.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Question eight's intense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=396.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=397.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So question eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=399.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This override will expand vocational programs and increase student access to the arts by giving us the funding to pay for new programming, staff to help students succeed, fix the school schedule at the level and increase educator and paraprofessional compensation to ensure living in competitive wages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=420.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Doesn't that sound expensive?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=422.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Vocational.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=423.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe what it is, Roy, you can help me if I'm wrong, is expanding the day, the school day, and the vocational day would kind of merge together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=435.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what we're asking for, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=440.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe it's maybe through negotiations will be the biggest cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=446.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, what we're looking at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=449.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is nothing close to $4 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=452.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not even close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=453.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not even close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=456.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Understand the trend here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=459.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Six, we heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=460.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Seven and eight, education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=463.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Understand every single community that has fought for an override in their communities has used what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=471.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the children, and the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=474.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Don't hurt our children, don't hurt our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=478.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I asked my colleagues, and we've heard people on the other side that's supporting this, where were you the meeting that you shut me up when we asked for free cash that we had?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=493.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you were there, and you still have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=498.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So let's understand this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=501.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now that you know the questions, let's go all the way back now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=506.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And let's make sure we get this and people can hear it, you can share it with your friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=512.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All Medford, at no time have we ever said, we're against an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=519.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We do not want it, never.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=521.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was never said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=525.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=527.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: was let's fix what's wrong now with that $5 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=531.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's bring everybody together to the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=534.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's have an open and transparent process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=537.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And let's work together to make sure we, if the need is there, that we fulfill it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=545.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And don't divide the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=548.764s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is what has happened now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=550.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now we're dividing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=552.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now it's yes or no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=553.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll be honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=556.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a responsible member of this community, if I didn't think now that we're here, there's nothing we can do, we'd have to step away, I'd step away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=565.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we have $34 million in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=569.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $34 million in free cash that has not been used that can recover this funding and make sure that we do this process correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=579.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=582.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And for those who don't know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=586.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just a quick step-by-step so you understand it's never quick with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=591.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had our budget meeting last year, the year before last.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=596.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And my colleagues were in unison, Councilor Caraviello was there, Council President Beas was there, and we were all together in the process that we cannot support this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=610.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's too dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=612.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we were all for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=616.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Until the night of the meeting, Councilor Caraviello and I stood there, and our council leadership team came out and said, hey, we just met with the mayor behind closed doors, and we're gonna vote for the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=630.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've come to an agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=631.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What agreement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=634.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't know what agreement it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=635.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Caraviello and Councilor Knight didn't know what agreement it was, but there was some sort of agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=640.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, as this grew, we kind of realized what the agreement was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=644.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A financial task force was created.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=649.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A school kid member, two city Councilors, the chief of staff, and the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=657.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Five people with no background in financial battles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=664.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=666.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At least not enough to lead us to the spot we need to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=672.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=673.65s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This financial task force is meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=675.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't hear anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=676.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are no minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=677.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's no information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=679.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're told we're going to get in a meeting before we do anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=684.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, you hear rumblings, so we call for a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=688.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have our city council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=691.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe it was the week before we had a subcommittee meeting, and a very smart red<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=700.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They said, so if you ask for an override and it doesn't pass, what does that mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=708.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That means devastation for the school department and our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=714.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Imagine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=716.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I came back the following week and I presented a plan that said what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=723.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Use our free cash, let's come to the table and do the right thing for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=729.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and let's not leverage our kids in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=735.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But guess what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=738.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's called Rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=739.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council Scarpelli shut down, can't speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=746.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is how we're getting messages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=748.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The Financial Task Force's plan was an override plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=752.11s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was what they came out with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=754.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We asked for the minutes, we asked for more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=756.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How did we get there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=757.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who was involved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=758.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=761.274s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now maybe the other side, because my friends are telling me, George, they're beating you up, they're beating you up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=765.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=767.78s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is all true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=769.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is all on tape.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=774.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, typical fashion, Friday we get emails from the mayor's office with $7.5 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=785.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Tuesday we come to a meeting, we're gonna vote on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=789.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a responsible city councilor, I will now invoke our Rule 21, close the meeting, and ask for an open meeting with everybody to talk about this in more depth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=802.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something that's unheard of, has never been heard of, never been done before, but our council leadership suspends the rules of the meeting and imposes a vote to not invoke Rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=819.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Done, you can't talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=820.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you, the council had five subcommittee meetings to talk about a city council newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=828.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=830.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And guess what that, that's free, nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=834.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But, the paper's adding up to $7.5 million and possibly more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=841.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They don't wanna talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=842.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, what do we do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=844.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We move on to the next meeting and I said, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=846.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I reach out to my state representative and I asked him, what is the plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=850.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What can I do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=851.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they said, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=852.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Legal from the state said you can now invoke Mass General Law 43, section 22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=859.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That supersedes any method rule, shuts the meeting down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=863.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, we get to the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=866.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our leadership team does the same exact thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=869.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Suspends the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=871.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Imposed, says they cannot impose rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=874.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I then invoke section 22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=879.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council leadership says, no, you can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=884.437s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Against the rule, against the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=888.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because what was gonna be said is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=893.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And listen closely, because this is how real communities do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=897.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In 2009, working in the city of Somerville, Mayor Joe Curtatone was at a crossroads with his community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=905.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Big cuts looming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=907.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He convenes a group, a working group, a financial working group that consisted of financial minds from Tufts, MIT, Harvard, banking leaders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=920.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You had the Sloans from Century Bank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=925.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You had his financial team present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=928.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You had community leaders and business leaders all in a row.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=932.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they worked on a plan because they said you needed to figure out three things before you wanted to go to an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=938.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One, how do we get there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=942.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still don't know how we got here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=945.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At least publicly, there's nothing been mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=948.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Two, how do we fix it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=951.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Three, how does this never happen again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=955.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what we were taught.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=958.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, they came out and they said, okay, this is what we're going to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=961.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to look at traffic and parking fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=963.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not going to make people happy, but they're going to take that money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=965.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're going to increase those fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=967.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're going to take that money, and that's going to be dedicated solely to the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=973.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Boom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=974.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Need taken away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=976.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=978.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need streets and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=980.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How do we figure that out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=982.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The focus is fees and fines for trash and building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=988.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And boom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=989.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Developers pay for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=992.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then the third piece, the most important piece, they sat together and they said, well, what can we do so this never happens again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=998.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How do we bring Somerville out of this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1001.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, they started this little project called Assembly Row.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1006.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now, whether you like it or not, there's a lot of money coming into the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1012.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, maybe you might question the growth, maybe question how they got there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1016.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not what I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1017.794s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'm saying is, that was an open process<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1021.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with financial minds that sat together to find a solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1027.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What has happened here, both in the fire department and the school department, it's been done in a vacuum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1035.316s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nobody knows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1038.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that a member of the community did file a FOIA request asking information for, we're waiting on that, hopefully we get that soon, that we can share with the community of what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1050.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: was shared, minutes, any notes, anything taken with this financial group?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1056.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who were the professionals they might have brought in that we don't know that could have helped them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1059.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nobody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1061.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here we are today, middle of September, people still don't know that there's an override vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1070.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like Councilor Caraviello said, he had explained to a person yesterday, why are we fighting it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1075.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $7.5 million for a new high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1077.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1081.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1083.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1087.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So people are saying, you know, but, you know, Councilor Scarpelli shouldn't be doing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1091.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's a city councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1092.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't give a shit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1098.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm going to fight for what I think is right so every citizen is heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1102.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I will tell you, it's not that I'm new to this, or I wouldn't do this, or I wouldn't have the guts to do something like this, because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1110.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were three former Councilors in this room, and only one of them, sorry Rick, only one of them put forth a debt exclusion that was probably put together by the best financial mind in Medford, an Aleesha Nunley, and we looked at the process of creating funding for a new main fire station on Main Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1134.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it was so simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1136.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We would exclude senior citizens because you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1139.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're hurting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1141.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Senior citizens are hurting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1145.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The vulnerable community, our disabled, our veterans, eliminate that group, those groups, and see what we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1154.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe at the time it was $17 a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1158.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We could swallow that, couldn't we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1160.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But that was with the process that gets started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1162.763s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even with this process right now, nobody knows what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1166.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still don't know what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1168.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing's been posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1170.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know there's rumblings that money's already being spent from free cash out of $34 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1177.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing's been done yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1180.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So having this meeting tonight is so important, this fundraiser's so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1184.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I tell you, I gotta thank so many people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1188.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The restaurants that donated,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1190.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: LaCasha's, Ronnie's Place, Richie Razzo's from Razzo's and Avellino's always donate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1197.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1201.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The thousands of dollars that were donated just the other day was amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1209.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And guess where that money's coming from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1212.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1214.268s">[Scarpelli]</a>: hard-working, method residents that want to do anything they can and fight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1219.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My neighbor, who's 84 years old, came to my house today and said, George, I can't come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1225.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He has $8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1231.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, God, no, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1234.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I tell you, what we do know is Kelly has done a great job with the real estate side and understanding the assessing side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1241.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have Nate Merritt's been doing his deep dive into the calculator that they have on their site that says all you do is poke in these numbers, bam, it's always this much money, you can handle that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1255.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Bullshit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1258.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I'm gonna tell you straight up, $380 for a person might sound not a lot of money, but some of the people I've talked to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1269.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I keep saying it, I won't use her last name, but I love her dearly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1272.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see Mrs. Jones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1274.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She said, George, help me understand this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1277.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I bought my house 50, 60 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1281.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So $48,000, I believe she said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1283.582s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think I tell people $50,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1286.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But now my house is worth a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1290.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My husband died 15 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1292.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was a seamstress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1294.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My social security doesn't cover my taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1298.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So should I move?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1300.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Some people want them to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1302.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I haven't heard one thing supporting our senior citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1306.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I haven't heard one thing how we're gonna help those homeowners that are struggling to stay in their homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1311.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Cuz one of my council colleagues actually said to me is, if your house is worth a million dollars, just take a hundred out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1318.663s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1320.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The understanding of not understanding what a home equity line is, that's devastating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1326.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Devastating for a resident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1329.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're not candy coating anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1332.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not hiding anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1333.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything you see has been public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1337.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have told my council colleagues what they're doing is dangerous to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1343.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still don't see the information how we got here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1346.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The way they want to get out of it is by taxing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1348.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Here's the other piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1350.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hey, it's only this much money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1353.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I hear that again from people, I'm going to lose my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1356.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because understand this, and I'll end with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1360.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What did we talk about one of our first meetings subcommittee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1363.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Rent control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1365.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then we talked about a transfer tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1368.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then we talked about a registry fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1370.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we talked about overrides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1376.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it stops there, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1377.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1379.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because my brother, I'll use my brother for example, just got his house assessed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1385.096s">[Scarpelli]</a>: An additional $400 a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1389.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, he's a young man, works very hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1392.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hopefully, he can recover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1395.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But then, Kelly did some homework, and we found out his assessment in 20 to 24 that's starting now, he thinks it's over with the assessment side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1406.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But Kelly, what are we hearing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1407.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In 2025, you're gonna get the sales data for 2023, because the peak of the real estate market will pass your home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1419.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's going up again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1421.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So have we heard any of that in their homework?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1424.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1426.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it's only $400.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1428.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But let's go a step further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1432.33s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A minimum $200 million renovated high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1437.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who fits that bill?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1439.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1441.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We want a new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1443.477s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A new one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1444.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Take it down to one new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1446.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Looking at $400 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1449.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You people don't understand what that number equates to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1454.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1456.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's scary and it's dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1460.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I didn't want to bring you out to scare you, but I brought you out to wake you up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1465.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This group never wanted to say no to an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1469.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we heard it from the smartest educational mind that I've been around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1476.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we haven't seen enough creativity, we haven't seen enough information, and there has been no transparency to show that we need this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1488.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've talked to our fire department, our firefighters are saying, don't hurt our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1494.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Don't build something just to check a box.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1498.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't want the fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1501.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1503.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if they're saying it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1506.792s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I've spelt it out for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1509.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a very simple process right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1514.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Fix the budget with $5 million in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1518.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's move forward and think of different ways to be creative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1521.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's be shocking and look at new growth and development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1526.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something we haven't seen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1527.922s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Am I lying, Ricky?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1531.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How many 40B jobs did we lose?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1533.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Three, how much money just in permits with those three projects?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1538.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Millions of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1539.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then tax revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1541.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've done the homework on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1542.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How much?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1543.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $16 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1543.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's one building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1544.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, these aren't lies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1546.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are true numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1547.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, you wish you had a platform<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1562.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I've been shut up way too easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1565.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, in this forum, I'm not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1566.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you're my voice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1567.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're helping us spread the message now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1570.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1572.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a list right now of over 600 volunteers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1576.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 600 volunteers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1580.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have captains that are going to be doing standouts that we have about, what, 60 to 80 people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1586.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 60 to 80 people already signed up to do standouts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1591.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm asking all of you, October 15th, Zach, if you wanna come on out, we're gonna meet at Hormel Stadium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1598.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody's gonna come out and we're gonna take our message and we're gonna go to the neighborhoods and we're gonna knock on doors and we're gonna give people the information that no one in the city has given them to help them understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1610.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Understand the rest of everybody else, don't be afraid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1613.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If a school kid member knocks on your door, it's a shame on you beyond that you have the information right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1620.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: beyond that you know the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1626.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So tomorrow, when you go to the coffee shop, or tomorrow when you go next door and you talk to Dave and have a cold drink, sit down with him and say, hey, do you know about the overrides?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1636.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the fire don't want it, the educational minds think it's absurd, and it's going to hurt people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1645.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here's the other piece that I seem to forget, and I don't ever want to forget this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1652.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have lived in a, grew up in a home with tenants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1655.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My dad made sure that we treated our tenants with pride and with respect, and we made sure we kept our rent reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1663.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the fact that my brother took that, and we still have the same family there that have been there for 10 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1670.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That family pays for a four bedroom in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1673.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They pay $2,400.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1673.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Pretty cheap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1676.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We all know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1677.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He will not raise that rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1680.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What people have to understand, if these taxes come about, taxpayers cannot handle this on their own.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1689.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's going to be passed down to the tenants, and renters are going to go through the roof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1696.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I want to thank all of you for coming out tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1700.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did I miss anything, Rick?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1701.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are you sure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1702.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's my captain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1703.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Rick's going to tell me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1705.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, again, I will tell you,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1707.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've got great people working on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1709.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm so excited for the energy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1712.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right now, we have 260 signs already on the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1716.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Steve's gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1717.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have 260 signs on the street, and we have another 200 here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1723.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Make sure you take your sign, but make sure you leave your name and your address so we know you've taken it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1730.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And show your neighbors and just give us a call, just so people know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1735.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: An override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1737.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you vote for an override and we give the mayor $6 million, even though they say that the money is going to go to the vocational school or art programs, that's not necessarily true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1753.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The money goes into the general fund to be used to the mayor's discretion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1758.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so again, there's a reason why we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1763.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $9 million<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1768.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1770.183s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those people that want to know real simple what free cash is, free cash is the money that we approve for the prior year in the budget that the mayor does not use, does not spend, and then it gets certified and carried over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1784.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then it goes into an account that she can do anything she wants with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1790.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1792.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I hope tonight what we really wanted to do is educate some people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1798.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: bring them out, have them know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1801.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Understand that we'll be having, if you please sign up for the standouts, we'll be doing door knocking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1807.666s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the big one is gonna be October 15th, Saturday, nine o'clock at Formell Stadium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1814.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna be meeting there and we're all gonna be hitting the streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1818.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna be going into the neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1820.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna be knocking on the doors, talking to your neighbors and letting them know that if this is voted through, it's not gonna hurt the children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1828.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor's just gonna have to put the money that she's playing with back to where it's supposed to be and help our children and help our schools and help our seniors and our residents so they don't get killed with these taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1841.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, thank you all for coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iIpPVk_DK1o&t=1843.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have a safe ride home and we'll talk to you soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=65.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=525.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what we're looking for, so you can explain, yes, Dance, what you were asking for tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=552.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I'd like to help the gentleman, but if we can't ask, I think we should table this until we get further information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=562.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we hate to move forward if we don't, he doesn't understand what we're asking as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=568.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=569.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is your partner coming tonight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=581.048s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, we can put it, can I step aside and maybe call him and does he, does he speak English?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=585.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe I step aside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=586.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=587.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can just move it aside so I can talk to him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=594.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Cause I know what we push this aside a few times and we want to get it forward if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=600.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=992.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, thank you for bringing this forward Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=994.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I did talk to, uh, to, uh, Mr. DiRico and they are in full support of finding other mechanisms to make, to bring this program, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1005.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and make it whole again in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1007.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that being that it isn't part of our agreement, it is a Tufts University policy that they're trying to really move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1018.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that what he did mention that it is one person from Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1022.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one thing that I was happy about that those people that are enrolled right now will still have the full scholarship,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1029.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and we'll finish the program in whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1031.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's a piece that I thought was very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1034.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, some of the people that were enrolled are, I think New Bedford, he mentioned some people out of the country, out of state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1043.839s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's a very diverse group that Tufts offers this program, but you do come across, as he said, Tufts University would love to do everything, but with the process and understanding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1056.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: paid tuition, free tuition, and finding that balance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1060.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's what Tufts is really trying to find to make sure that this moves forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1064.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, again, I don't, what I, the message I received from Morocco is that they are, they will look high and low to make sure that this will continue, but it definitely needs a pause right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1078.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: so they can come back on stronger footing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1081.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, and like again, I said, I know that there is one person from Medford and my biggest fear was if we're cutting this program with that person, not be able to fill what they started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1092.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he said, absolutely not there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1094.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody that's in the program right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1095.436s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think he said it was five that are all going to move forward and all going to finish with the, uh, what they promised with Tufts promise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1103.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2097.98s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can, yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2146.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, President Pierce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2147.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked with our partners from the market and answered all the questions we needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2156.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were some questions that needed to be completed today during one of the process that was brought forward with the health department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2168.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All the documents and everything was signed off today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2171.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So everything is in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2172.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'll move forward for approval, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2177.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, you know, sooner than later, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2240.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2241.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now again, everybody has a platform.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2244.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sure that everybody knows that I am for voting no on the override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2252.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My fellow Councilors are supporting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2254.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, uh, that's not a secret.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2256.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the, the biggest fear as we're going through, uh, respecting to disagree, to disagree for both of our, our, uh, our viewpoints,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2267.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think what's important is that we have to hear what senior citizens are bringing forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2274.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've heard everything from, I think I've talked to maybe 30 senior citizens in the last probably six days, because now the word's starting to get out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2283.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there's so many views that are so confusing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2287.362s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One person said to me that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2290.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: her and her friends that were together at the table said, Councilor Scarpelli, why would you oppose a $7.5 million new high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2299.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a great fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2300.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a great price, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2302.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and the understanding that truly, the residents of the city don't know what is even on these ballots, these ballot questions, because we haven't informed anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2316.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The process stated on both the state site and if you visit other sites that have either passed or failed their overrides, you've seen a robust response<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2330.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: process where there were informative sessions within their community so people were educated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2338.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when they made that choice, they understood the impact in their lives, in their neighbors' lives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2344.553s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that we've done a major disservice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2348.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're actually two weeks away from the start of early voting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2354.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the questions from the most vulnerable people in our community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2359.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I can publicly have said it a thousand times, this group, the financial task force that was put together, came back, we haven't seen minutes, there was no public participation, there was no information session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2373.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's now regulated to people going to the elections office and they're giving them a form that just reads what the override questions are, six, seven, and eight, and that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2387.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and again, I reached out to the director at the Council of Aging, and I asked if there's a possibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2398.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, it doesn't have to be my view.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2400.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It could be Councilor Bears in the yes team and Councilor Scarpelli in the no team, but can we have an information center<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2408.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: at the senior center so we can inform our seniors and we have the director that can reach out to all of our senior citizens in the city whether they own a rent because when you hear the stories of some of these seniors saying geez yeah we i did the calculator but it wasn't right because my house is appraised at 880 000 shame on you i can't believe that you did that but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2434.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when I did the calculations, it said 600,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2438.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so they had questions with the city assessor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2443.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so they came to me about questions about the assessor, about their homes being assessed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2447.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they're not wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2448.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The city assessor doesn't have the true numbers because he's not prepared for this and he wasn't involved in this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2454.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you talk about the ramifications in taxes, we have,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2462.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It goes both ways, because we had someone say, George, is it true I'm going to pay $5,000 more in taxes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2467.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, unless you want a $10 million home in Medford, I don't see that happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2471.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But that's the fear that's true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2473.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's really happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2475.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we do have people that, whether we want to believe it or not,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2479.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They have to make decisions whether $400 a year could impact what medications they're gonna purchase, or if they can travel to see a child, or if they can figure out if they can go out to dinner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2491.663s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's how scared they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2494.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the question was, how do they get there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2496.364s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, I don't know, because we don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2499.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because like I said in the past, I've tried to put through a debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2504.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what I did when I worked with the financial team and the city assessor at the time, they showed us the breakdown with eliminating our most vulnerable residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2513.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's our seniors, our residents with special needs and our military.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2521.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they broke it down for us so you could see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2524.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that was a question I had with the city assessor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2526.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said, when will you have that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2528.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he said, unfortunately, you probably won't see that till the end of October, the true breakdown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2533.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, he, to, to, to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2537.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: move forward with that, the fear that people don't understand that in 2025, these senior citizens homes are going to be assessed again, but not at the 2025 rate of housing, but at 2023, which was a very good year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2553.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that means the homes are going to be a price higher than it really should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2558.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there are so many fear factors in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2560.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to go back to what I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2564.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I talked to the director of the Council of Aging, and she said, unfortunately, I have to run it by the mayor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2572.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Anytime, as a city councilor, I wanted to go to the senior center, I would call and say, I'd like to come down and introduce myself and buy ice cream.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2582.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've probably all done it, and it was never an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2585.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I called the next day and I said, can you please let me know if we can do this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2590.571s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And her words were, unfortunately, the mayor responded and said that we need to get legal representation, whether we can go and sit with our seniors to help them understand what this process is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2604.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, don't get me wrong, there's probably some that are for it, there'll be for it, there's some against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2608.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The problem is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2611.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I hear the word transparency come out of this office and this team, I might vomit because this is totally the opposite of what transparency is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2621.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the total opposite.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2624.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's like bizarro world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2625.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What's transparent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2626.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whatever the opposite is, this is what we've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2630.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, social media loves it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2634.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli never, ever once has said, I don't want an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2639.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'm saying is, first, let's see if we need the override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2644.822s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's publicly work together to figure it out and stakeholders throughout the whole community figure it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2652.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Figure it out, because if you go on these different websites and you look at what override means, so let's say the MTA, they have a great blueprint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2661.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they said, before you go out to do an override, you make sure you get the buy-in from stakeholders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2668.16s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And those stakeholders would be your superintendent, your senior citizens, your business community, your students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2676.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We did nothing of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2677.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what I'm begging this council to do<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2681.423s">[Scarpelli]</a>: join me in asking the mayor to hold a session, hopefully next week together in this chamber as a form of a motion that we hold an information session that seniors can come into this chamber and we can explain what the override is, how we got here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2698.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like again, I'm gonna say it again, in every community that I've researched, and I've done a lot of research on this now, the three most important pieces when you talk about overrides, how did we get there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2710.353s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How are we going to correct it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2712.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what are we going to do so we never have to go there again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2716.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know how we got here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2718.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Although we want to say that, you know, the administration for years past, I don't disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2723.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2724.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done a terrible job in former leaderships to really keep things up to par.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2731.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not disagreeable at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2734.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But where we are today, think about this now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2737.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I tried to explain this to seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2738.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what's scary to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2740.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If on November 5th it's voted in, the process that the mayor has called for, that their taxes will be, you'll see those taxes starting in January of 2025, right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2752.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No time to plan, no time to understand, even that, and I'd love to hear it, it's only $37 a month, it's only $40 a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2759.247s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's farce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2762.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because as homes are being assessed, they're getting taxes higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2766.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As homes are being assessed, CPA taxes are rising.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2770.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As homes are being assessed, you're adding these $40 a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2774.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That, in their new tax bill, it's not $40 a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2778.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To some people, they're looking at four, five, $600 a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2784.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know because I've seen it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2787.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's disingenuous to sit back as a council to say, we're all about affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2792.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're all about making sure that we want to keep residents in their homes and we're going to fight for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2796.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Remember all those buildings that developers are coming in and we had all those people that are wearing buttons and we're all rah-rah-ing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2803.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, we have thousands of those people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2805.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we represent every day that are telling us, stop, because the only outcome for them is going to be selling their home and finding an alternative place to live.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2818.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, in a form of emotion, Mr. President,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2822.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I make the motion that the city council, as a team, ask for an open meeting for all of our senior citizens to have an opportunity before the start of early voting, because as they said, the voting starts, I believe, Tuesday the 16th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2838.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's important that they come and they hear, they get the answers that we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2842.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, again, it might be yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2845.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll have to respect that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2847.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it might be no, and you'll have to respect that, but at least give the seniors an opportunity to understand the impact, to understand the process, because that's the other piece that really bothers a lot of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2863.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can keep going, but I don't want to make it more of a platform than it sounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2867.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I beg my colleagues to vote yes to ask the mayor to open the city council chambers maybe next Wednesday night for the senior citizens to come in and inform them of what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2877.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2904.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2904.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if we can, uh, council bears, if you can ask the mayor to, to allow the director of a council of aging to reach out, to give the opportunity to reach out to all the senior citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2915.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they're informed, um, because a lot of people don't have this platform and don't follow social media and without a newspaper, it's very difficult that they don't know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=2924.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we could do that, I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3054.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, then that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3055.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what I'll do is I think the Freedom of Information Act that was presented for information that was gathered through that task force and the emails from the assessor, we could bring it that night so everybody can see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3067.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4288.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, no, it's just an open forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4291.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It could be any member that has a background that can sit and meet with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4296.532s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It could be a override professional from the city or the state that would go in and talk with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4301.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But unfortunately, the mayor mentioned that we need legal representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4510.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4511.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just so I'm clear, so what you brought up earlier, just to be clear, because I want to make sure that I'm not speaking out of turn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4518.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you met with the assessor, but the calculation wasn't part of the assessor's team, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4524.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just so I'm clear with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4526.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The calculation that's being put out by the group that's, the four method group, the four yes group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4541.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not the assessor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4570.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's wonderful, Matt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4571.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the question I had was, because I want to make sure, because the emails that we have, when I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4577.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: speak with the assessors, I don't wanna talk out of turn, because I hate to be called a liar, because that happens a lot lately, that what the assessor's words were, and an email, we'll get it for us, that they had no part of any calculations, and they do not have any of the calculations that normal communities, when they go through an override, they show a breakdown, and the breakdown says,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4604.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: override ramifications or impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4608.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It would be single family homes, two family homes, three family homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4611.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Cause I have the email that states that it will not be ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4615.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those type of calculations that we're seeing didn't come from his office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4619.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just want to make sure when we meet, I don't want anybody to go around saying that this is contentious because I know the calculations and you're correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4628.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's from the state and we understand that, but there's a lot of, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4631.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's a lot of variables<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4634.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that aren't factored because I know firsthand because I sat with a resident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4642.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that the calculations that are out there that state that his house is appraised at X, but is truly Y, it's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4651.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not apples to apples.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4652.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when I talked to the assessor, they said, of course not, because that's not tied in yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4657.159s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just want you to know that we wanna make sure when we come to the 15th that we're not spending too much time looking at or talking about, oh yeah, I'll tell him the truth, I'm not telling the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4666.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just wanna make sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4668.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The assessor was not part of any calculations with any financial group of task force here in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4675.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's their exact words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4676.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4685.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, that's not minutiae.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=4720.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So not the newest ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5360.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5368.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Next we have item 24-476, resolution to support question two, replacing the high stakes MCAS test graduation requirements for high school students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5380.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council President Baez.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5390.18s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I think this is, it's very powerful when you read it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5502.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: See, I'm already voting with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5507.574s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So powerful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5509.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5695.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, anyone else I just, as I think accounts of as they can scale and hope people sitting down out there is that but I'll be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5704.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm behind you 1000% with this initiative, I think as a former teacher, until you're sitting in a classroom, and you're working with a dedicated teacher who's bawling her eyes out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5715.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because you have a new ESL student that just moved to the city, to this country weeks ago, and that you have to try to explain to them what snow is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5726.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And knowing that impact, that it'll never succeed, and watching the pain, and realize that these are the questions that are leading decisions to what we're looking at as educators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5744.289s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I love the fact that I was a strong advocate for the portfolio format, where you really saw the growth of a student from beginning to end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5756.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it made teachers, what we saw, it happened right in front of us, you took away the creativity away from teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5764.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you took away so much talent because instead of them being creative to this individual student, individual classes, they had to focus on what this test forced you to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5776.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's been a long time coming, like you said, the graduation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5780.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My daughter Gianna, she is a Dean's List student, 4.0 student in college, 3.5 in high school, had the most difficult time passing the MCAS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5794.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I saw it firsthand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5795.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A young lady that had to fight a speech impediment and understanding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5803.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what the limitations that you have as a teacher to help a student with a disability is another most painful process to watch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5811.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I agree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5814.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope we can go a step further and moving forward this initiative further to look at maybe using testing as one mechanism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5822.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but also followed up with some sort of portfolio process where you can really see our kids shine and our teachers shine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5829.92s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would, I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5833.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So do we have any questions on Zoom?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5835.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It looks like Julie, oops, Julie Roberto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5851.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5852.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Name and address for the record<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5933.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Next we have at the podium name and address of the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5936.822s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have 33 minutes and three days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6325.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6326.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We do have Mr. Cassinetti.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6330.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have name and address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6331.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have your... Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6340.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have to unmute, Mr. Cassinetti.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6345.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yep, you're good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6369.233s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6511.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6511.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, to follow up with that council president bears, I think that when MCAS started the biggest issue with the teachers, where the teachers weren't really involved, it was politicians and bureaucrats was it, and there was a huge gap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6524.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, so I think now you're seeing, um, hopefully waking up and, you know, look at different options when we're assessing our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6533.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So on the motion council bears second by council Callahan, uh, Mr. Clerk,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6540.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6541.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6543.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How's that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6572.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, seven, the affirmative zero and the negative motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6577.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can I take this home for my wife?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6578.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can Dina, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6581.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's so powerful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=124.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=253.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=255.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=256.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is there anybody from the administration available to speak?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=262.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The chief of staff or someone else from the mayor's office?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=276.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=277.969s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have one question that I was informed by another city department that they were told that they needed to stop their negotiations because of fear of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=292.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the outcome of the override so they didn't want to commit, I believe, to move forward with any issues with funding moving forward until they know what happens in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=306.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm a little curious if that's the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=310.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe we should look at, I know there are some issues that we see that are on here now that I wouldn't object to because I know it's time sensitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=322.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it's something that's really needed, I think we should move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=325.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if there are concerns with the override vote and funding moving forward, that they're holding off negotiations, then I think it's something we need to talk about, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=340.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1384.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1386.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, Mr. Randazzo again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1387.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for everything you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1389.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, uh, you are your, um, history and saving money for our community is second to none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1397.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that everyone should realize that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1400.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But my question is, along with this, I've I've gotten many phone calls from the business district, and I know what some of the changes in parking in Medford Square that the discussion has been that there's going to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1414.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, the parking for the business community, um, on, um, on Salem Street next to that parking lot next to the I believe it's a national grid building their substation building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1428.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One of the concerns that the businesses has that there is no lighting in that lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1434.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that been discussed by any chance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1436.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, we are office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1475.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1475.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1476.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1624.714s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1627.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A question on that topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1632.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is the elevator still currently out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1654.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, I bring this up because last night we had a very important meeting and I think everybody unanimously decided that having a community meeting with our senior citizens that we're having some confusion on what the debt exclusion and the override questions were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1672.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I get had a few phone calls today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1675.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh from uh representing people that are representing that uh our senior citizens and they were very concerned that uh will the elevators be functioning on october 15th and if not i think we need to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1690.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: seriously consider moving that committee to the whole meeting to a location where senior citizens can attend that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1699.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it defeats the purpose of what we agreed on yesterday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1703.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we have people that can't climb stairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1706.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is the 15th something that can work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1740.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, if we can, if we just have the clerk, if we can, as soon as Mr. Riggi gets us an update, if we can update the council with that, that'd be greatly appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1751.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1892.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Forgive me, that's a late hand Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1990.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1993.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, it's not the fire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1997.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was, uh, was talking to someone from the negotiating team from our method police department and they were told during negotiations, I believe that negotiations will be delayed, um, for the fact that the override, um, might be in question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2013.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So because of that fact that we need to, um, hold off until we get more understanding or, or see what the vote would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2022.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2025.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in November to move forward with their negotiations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2028.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, the second part of that question is that if that is an issue, um, I'm under the impression that, uh, there's a negotiating line item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2039.407s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if if that's not the case, could you educate me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2043.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if there is a case that that it is, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2047.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if you can let us know what we are with that as well because in my in my capacity when there's negotiations there's understanding that most municipalities have a negotiated line item that has funding already set aside and if we're holding that out<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2068.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because of fear that the override will not move forward and needing that funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2075.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It could be construed of maybe as a fair tactic if the administration is moving in a for yes vote or it then leaves me a little befuddled if we don't have a line item when we negotiate with our union members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2092.796s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2144.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2147.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, just with that, though, I just, I think it is a direct correlation of what we're asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2153.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2154.747s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If that is, and we do find that until until we get to our next regular meeting, where we will vote on these, these initiatives, I think that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2164.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the understanding that if we're looking at, and this is the case, if you do find research and they do come back and says, no, we did mention that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2175.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if that's the case, then it's relevant for tonight's meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2181.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the fact that if we do have questions about our financial question marks after the override and where,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2191.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we're talking we're we're discussing this with a negotiating team then i think that everything has to be on the table when the mayor presents any sort of funding for anything right now um like i said there are things that are presented today that when it comes to a vote i i don't think i can hesitate because i think it's needed but there are some other things that we can look at and say hey i would like i would motion to sever and then look at the different options because of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2218.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh the need of funding if that's the case moving forward so i think there's a direct correlation of what i was told and what is on the agenda tonight so thank you mr president and thank you chief of staff nazarian thank you and thank you for being here councillor Leming um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2267.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: yeah i apologize i just want to make sure if it's if i'm confusing councillor uh Leming i can clarify if he wants um the confusion is if there is an issue that's dealing with our city financial concerns and and one group or one situation is being um frozen for uh the the fear of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2291.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: lack of funding later on in November, then this would be a concern moving any money doctor to the next level, considering if there is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2305.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: some fear and I appreciate the chief of staff looking into it and hoping it's just a rumor, but I got it from a credible source.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2314.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's actually part of the negotiating team that said that that did happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2318.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'd like to see maybe, maybe there's some misunderstanding there and get some corrections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2323.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if you're confused with that, I can clear it up if you have any questions for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2397.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2401.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I understand that we have, we have, we, we can, we can respect, excuse me, we can, we can agree to disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2411.477s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I think it's important that, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2415.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if it does come to a climate when we need to petition to move funding around from different accounts, there are mechanisms that we could do that depending on what accounts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2426.486s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would say everything would be open until we understand the true financial picture on November 5th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2433.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2646.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think you have, I just got a text message, Mr. Clerk, that maybe I'm out of line, but there's people trying to get on the Zoom that had questions with that response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2657.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But like I said, I will move this forward and with a yes vote until we get more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2665.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2667.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2668.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, oh yeah, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2673.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, no, it's Harold McGilvrey, the negotiating from the police department wanted to get on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2680.745s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2681.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2682.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2682.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2682.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it would be yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2741.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry, Mr. Clerk, did you call my name?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2745.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, I'd say no, I wanna hear more of what Council President is saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2751.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can't worry about his percentages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=958.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=962.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You made a great presentation for the city of Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=966.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You said Broadway five times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=970.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is what we've been talking about here in Medford, with the lack of the movement with our zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=980.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: consultant to look at what Medford wants to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=985.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so I just think that you said some things with the neighborhood, but I know the neighborhood on the Medford side has a real problem with this area right now because of some fears and because of lack of true understanding where we're going in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1003.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The spot development, we're seeing that happen all over the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1007.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But these are the issues that I find being a problem when the council for the projects has mentioned how it appeals to Broadway, which isn't Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1024.453s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I tend to be a little leery, that's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1028.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1145.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would really, again, when you're talking about a project like this and what it affects and when we're doing it, where we're not having meetings, I think that's a slippery slope again, councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1158.842s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would recommend that you wouldn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1523.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1525.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you're taking over the boils?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1527.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1529.423s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So Madam President, I see everything in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1532.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Before I open up, there is one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1535.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You were applying for workman's comp.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1537.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that completed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1540.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It says that you were going to apply for your insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1548.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1551.159s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President to the clerk, if the gentleman could just forward you that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1556.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would move in favor, as long as you have that document in hand tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1562.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to hold it up, but if we can do that, if you said you have it, just send a copy, then my recommendation would be to move and approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1570.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as long as the clerk has that tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1577.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1578.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1578.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1578.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1668.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, can we just dismiss 23-386 please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1690.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1691.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sure that everybody's heard and everybody's, it's not just in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1696.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a pretty severe issue, all over the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1702.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, you're hearing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1705.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you're hearing that now that you're seeing this rat infestation, not just in where they traditionally would find them, you know, close to restaurants or close to water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1715.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now you're finding them in areas like the Heights where most of the homes there are ledge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1724.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so it's starting to become even more disturbing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1728.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that the Board of Health is super busy, but I think we need to find<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1735.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, an avenue where we're putting together a serious team that's devoted to this issue right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1743.796s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's what we're seeing right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1746.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, residents contacting us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1749.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then I know that the Board of Health is responding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1754.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: piece mail, I know that something was sent out, and it was forwarded by one of the residents, one of the residents that reached out to me, and who requested this resolution be brought up that now the what we've been talking about for a while is having the possibility of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1774.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The Board of Health, as long as the homeowner is willing to allow them on their property, they're willing to do some abatement on private property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1781.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In the past, that's been an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1783.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know this council moved forward to try to find a solution where we have the Board of Health work together with residents because one of the questions back maybe two years ago was that you could see the nest<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1798.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but unfortunately the exterminating company couldn't go one foot to that nest that had the issue because it was on private property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1808.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we need to do a better job communicating with not just people that are complaining, but I think the community as a whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1819.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then really look at some sort of a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1821.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1823.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody's saying that, well, some of it's development, the movement of the streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1827.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Here's the thing, we haven't done much development and we haven't really fixed many streets and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1833.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when you're seeing projects like tonight that are coming up, we're gonna see some more movement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1839.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna see some more, we're gonna see greater projects and we're gonna see the earth being moved in a greater capacity, which means<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1849.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: more of that rat infestation moving from, you know, from one area to the rest of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1857.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, we do have a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1859.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the resident that contacted me, that the Board of Health moved to support that neighborhood, but once we heard that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1872.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the feedback I got was this isn't just in one neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1876.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This neighborhood was in the Heights, by the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1878.981s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But then I got phone calls when I put this resolution up, I had phone calls with, I had phone calls South Medford, I had phone calls West Medford, the Hillside, I had phone calls in the Wellington area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1893.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it was, it really stirred the nest, to say the least.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1899.745s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we really need to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1902.187s">[Scarpelli]</a>: really be proactive right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1903.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, when you're talking about the summer, in a few months,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1910.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: rodents are going to leave the exterior of our neighborhoods and now try to find homes and businesses to infiltrate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1922.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think if we can, I know that we put it out there, I would make a motion that we have a meeting with the Board of Health and any other department that needs to be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1934.671s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1936.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, whether it's DPW or code enforcement that we bring all the parties together to try to find a way to put a program in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1950.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I'm not gonna, I know neighboring communities, I've talked to neighboring communities and they've had remediation plans that don't, that go, they're pretty deep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1962.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It doesn't look at just,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1963.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, baiting catch basins and putting in traps, they're really looking with different entities to bring in to help us stop the reproduction of the rats in their nests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1977.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I know it was a little winded, but I think this is serious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1983.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that it's coming up a lot and we don't hear any solutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1990.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would make the motion that we,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1993.663s">[Scarpelli]</a>: contact the board of health, the code enforcement, the DPW department, and someone from the mayor's office for communications to try to find a way that we send out a detailed plan and try to at least get the information that's needed to help this process along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2010.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2389.666s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2392.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As I'm going through the, everything looks good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2395.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, what are your hours of operations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2399.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're keeping the same operation hours as current.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2406.01s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that that's my question, my fellow councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2408.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe that when we allow a special permit for extended hours, it goes, is it, do we see any restrictions with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2417.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I, cause I don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2421.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, so seven o'clock to 11 o'clock, is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2424.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2426.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, so that's the issue, cause we allow a certain,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2433.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: hourly certain hours and then to go to the two o'clock request at 1030 to 10am 1030am to two you have it stretched off and the requested hours that asked you have to come back for a special permit for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2449.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, as we approve this, the hours have to change so 11 o'clock until the special permit is heard is on the petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2459.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It says requested hours 10 30 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2461.929s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then it's crossed out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2463.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You had two a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2465.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then below it is seven a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2467.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to 11.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2485.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2485.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'm telling you, you can't do that until<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2489.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The permit that's requested in front of us is a request from 7 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2493.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to 11.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2494.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To extend those hours, you have to come in front of us with a special permit for extended hours use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2503.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: By changing over, the ownership changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2507.65s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The vote that was taken in the past is dismissed, and now it starts again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2529.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2534.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, if we could do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2535.041s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't wanna hurt you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2535.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just wanna make sure this is, you get everything you need in place so there isn't an issue later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2544.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2545.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would move forward with the petitions request right now in favor and the petitioner contact the clerk in the morning for the extended hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2755.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, were there any other clauses that aren't in this that any stipends or anything else that was added to this that we're not seeing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2767.571s">[Scarpelli]</a>: COVID money or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2802.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, it's okay, I just, I trust you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2804.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we have the retro, that's involved as well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2809.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, I would waive any time restraints.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2812.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think these employees have waited long enough that we move forward and move this through as fast as we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2820.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I move approval, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=340.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mike Noville from National Grid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=344.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Cam Hansel from National Grid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=378.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=379.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What time of day will this work be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=382.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You can determine that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=384.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: okay so we can do something at night because right now that area is a mess traffic wise so and the last piece I know maybe the city engineer the paving was that going to be curb to curb?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=416.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we'll be done curb to curb.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=485.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, but are we now in the practice, because it's great news if it is, but that now our public utilities that come in to open up our streets, it'll be curb to curb like we do with the private entities as well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=557.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=557.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, if I can, while the engine is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=562.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How long, again, will the process take for this project?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=569.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=569.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that two reasons for the question, that area is a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=575.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we all know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=577.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now that it's all right turns there, I mean, that area's just flooded in the morning now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=582.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This could be something done at night with the city's request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=586.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is there a better time to do it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=591.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Police, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=599.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For safety reasons, we would defer to the traffic sergeants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=602.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's something that if we can, as part of the record, we'll reach out as part of a motion to reach out to the chief of police to request their thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=618.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if it's not that we have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=621.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a detailed informational plan that goes out to our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=625.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And just because that, I take that, I think everybody knows that trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=630.494s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've heard phone calls and emails from multiple residents about that right turn only being a major change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=637.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then if you drive through Medford Square, now you see why, but I think that making sure that everybody's informed of what happens if it does happen during the day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=645.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But thank you, ma'am.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1468.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1469.494s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Bears and Councilor Caraviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1472.456s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that my frustration is what's felt throughout the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1475.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You said something very important because what bothered me more than anything in this time in our country, you want people to get involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1484.423s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I had five to six people call me and say, you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1488.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll never, ever vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1492.907s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in an election for the city ever again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1496.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll leave my vote just the national agenda and that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1498.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because that's how disgusted they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1501.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I can see why, being part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1503.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is, and I'll give you an example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1508.079s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Caraviello did, in running his election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1512.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was honest, he was fair, he worked hard, and he asked volunteers to come out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1517.859s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And those volunteers came out to assist, like any candidate could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1523.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any candidate could have done what Councilor Caraviello did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1526.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, it didn't come out in his favor, and that's life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1531.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But to hear the horrific issues that poll workers were put in, and the poll watchers, so people don't know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1544.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you're allowed to have poll watchers, and it's a machine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1548.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the poll watchers go out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1549.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a calculated strategy where they're allowed to have poll watchers sit in a relatively close area that you can hear and see the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1563.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The process is very simple, that the poll watchers<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1567.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was talk that they were told they can't sit down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1572.65s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then they were told they can't sit down if they bring their own seats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1576.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if that's the case, OK, bring your own seat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1578.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Pole watchers sat in their seats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1582.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then they were told to move 25 feet away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1586.293s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then the process was very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1588.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The process that by law states, in the general laws that we had attorneys pass out to each polling station, each warden, and it said straight out, the process is such, when the person approaches to vote, if they have a license or not,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1609.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because we had the new scanning system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1611.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And believe me, I do not blame the poll, the workers that are at the poll, I don't blame them, because a lot of them are great people and they just weren't prepared, but they had the licenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1623.671s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They have the license, you're supposed to sweep their name and address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1628.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're supposed to say, George Scarpelli, 27 Butler Street, and the poll worker responds back, George Scarpelli, correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1637.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for the purpose of clarity and transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1642.105s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then what they do is that person has a book, same as the workers do, and they check off who comes in and votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1650.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then if you have a machine that works for you, volunteers that want to work for you, you then have people pick up those books every two to four hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1658.16s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then you have people in offices or at homes calling people and saying, hey, we see you haven't voted today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1665.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you need a ride?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1666.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a machine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1667.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's done all over the country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1669.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we saw this past Tuesday, I'm not even gonna bring up a formal, maybe I will, because I said what happened before, I said, please, this is why this country is such a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1682.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Conspiracy theories through the roof, and I'm not a conspiracy theorist, I hate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1687.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what happened this past week and the weeks before this and understanding how this process went was a disgrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1698.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How much money did we lose?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1700.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you don't open up the boxes of the ballots to a few days before you have to mail out the mailing ballots, and you realize you have someone's name spelt wrong, so they have to be thrown away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1714.745s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now you have to get ballots reprinted and rushed in, which is thousands of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1720.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then they go out and then we realize that we're getting phone calls from Ward 6 saying everybody that ordered, that requested four ballots got eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1728.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody that got asked for two got four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1731.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody asked for three got six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1733.613s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we had to reassure the public that even though it looks bad, they cannot vote three to six times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1741.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we said that day,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1743.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that meeting before the election, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1746.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it's because you're understaffed, ask for help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1748.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we have to approve anything from this council to assist, bring in a thousand people from the state, whoever you need to assist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1756.779s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, Councilor Caballero's team was very proactive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1761.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know for sure, because my wife was one of the poll watchers, that at her location, she showed up at seven where polls open, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1768.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, at 7.30, they still weren't ready to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1772.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then we heard some places that we had machines that weren't working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1777.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: By law, when you test a machine, the notice has to go out to the public and it has to be done in an open process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1787.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Before the election, that process has to be open to the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1791.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They come in and you can watch the Elections Commission test the machines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1798.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That didn't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1799.945s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That didn't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1801.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then as you went through the whole process, we will tell you that we were given a notice from the election director that said, the votes that were taken, the votes that were taken from early voting and absentee voting will be put through the voting machine here at City Hall at 8.30 in the morning and then posted at eight o'clock here at City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1829.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a memo<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1831.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that's public that went out to the election officials, elected officials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1836.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then you realize, now you go through the numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1840.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You sit there and you go through the numbers, you have people getting their numbers, and it's a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1847.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was talks that people coming back saying that the police were being yelled at by wardens, that ballots were being counted, they didn't understand where the ballots were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1855.805s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had people here counting ballots without being in public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1863.071s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now that's, that's, it's, it's not to, it's, it's, it's, is it, does it affect the election?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1871.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I don't think it affects the election, but the perception of it is terrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1878.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if this happens in any other, any other department, things have to be taken swiftly and quickly and making sure this doesn't happen again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1889.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1891.417s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm gonna ask for, if we can, as a resolution, I would amend the existing paper to ask for our election commissioner, our election director, our commission,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1909.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to come before this council to explain in detail what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1915.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one of the biggest questions I have from a lot of people that were waiting that night at 835, we had probably between, I believe it was 10,500 votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1925.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they said, that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1930.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we said, wait a second, Medford has never, never been that low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1935.351s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What happened to the ballots that were counted in the morning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1937.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know what you're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1941.035s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So then all of a sudden at one o'clock in the morning, they posted something that said they found the ballots and it was 4,000 more ballots and this is what it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1950.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Regardless who won, who lost,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1952.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That just doesn't look good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1955.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Perception is reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1957.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is what, this is the type of situation that brings the fire to the ignorance of our country sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1966.11s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what's sad about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1967.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the reason for this, the reason why I want to move forward and, and get a detailed report, and then ask for, you know, the Secretary of State's office to get involved to them do an audit, because we need answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1981.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So people can understand that your elected officials are holding people accountable when they're not doing their job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1988.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can squash<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1989.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and move forward for our next elections without any other issues or concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1994.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because like Councilor Behr said, perception is reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1997.671s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said it the night, the week before the election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2000.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Perception is reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2001.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what happened is exactly what we would hope, we were scared would happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2007.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now you have a room full of people that are just as upset because the process was terrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2014.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was terrible and somebody has to be held accountable, period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2018.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because in my position, if I left a little kid in the park by himself unattended, guess what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2025.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The next morning, I wouldn't be working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2029.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So in the elections department, when you make these many mistakes, something has to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2036.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So Madam President, that's my resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2039.456s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate it and thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2718.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we are at the point where everybody really expressed the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2723.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think the governing body in the state needs to get involved, and I think that this council should send a letter to the Secretary of State's office, to Galvin's office, so I'd make that a formal motion that we craft a letter, send it to the Secretary of State's office, and ask them to look into this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2744.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2747.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And just if I can, Madam President, I don't want people to understand that when we heard all these issues, the poll workers that are there are maybe mostly the sweetest people in the world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2762.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're doing something that's thankless, truly is thankless.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2766.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But one thing that was resounding throughout that day is how they weren't trained properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2773.373s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They didn't know what was right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2776.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the sweetest woman that I love dearly, when I went to vote, she looked at me and she said, the first three letters of your name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2783.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, no, that's not how it goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2787.717s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But these are the issues that went on everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2790.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had one poll watcher that was put 25 feet away in the corner, was presented the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2797.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She was then moved by the warden behind eight feet away in compliance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2802.202s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then our elections commissioner came in and said, get out, go back to where you were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2808.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not the rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2811.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it was the arrogance as well, because you have people that volunteered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2816.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and as part of this process, which this is what we want in our country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2820.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We want fair and open involved processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2823.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and again, I think that letter that we draft helps with the healing and the understand that we can move on and understand that we have something in place, Madam President, for especially November, that we feel safe and confident in our processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2839.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5068.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I think the biggest concern that I have is, as we're talking, as we're seeing some of the new changes we're seeing and some of the development that we're seeing, one constant comes back to me from neighbors and residents that they shared what I felt was an issue was that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5089.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we're moving forward with these zoning changes, we see that they're important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5092.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We see that they can be successful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5094.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we don't have, though, is proper notification when we do certain jobs in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5102.379s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think we do a very good job informing our constituents of projects that are coming about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5108.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll use Mystic Ave as an example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5112.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That evening, we talked about a building that sounds great, but I posed it for the fact that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5120.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it right now, it's a unicorn, and I didn't get any answer from the administration of what the vision is for that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5128.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No different than what's happening over at the old KISS 108 site at the T building in Wellington, that the building's being razed and we still have no vision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5138.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, that's very close to having two gateways of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5144.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that moving forward with any more zoning is, to me,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5150.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is a slippery slope to the fact that we're not letting our constituents know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5154.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are some projects that organizations, I'll give you an example with our housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5162.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There have been multiple meetings, multiple neighbors, opportunities for people to speak on different projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5173.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think we see that too often.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5176.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when it comes to some of these positions and some of these projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5181.64s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I tell you, I think when we talked about putting together the zoning study and having that bring that team in that will go neighborhood to neighborhood, remember we talked about that and getting the idea of the residents of what people want Medford to look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5198.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It seems like we forgot that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5199.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not doing that anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5201.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's been put in the back burner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5203.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, we haven't done anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5206.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're coming up with new zoning changes and we're saying, well, we could do this now because this might work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5214.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But in totality, we still don't have a plan and we still aren't including all of our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5220.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and I think that's a concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5222.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5247.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think for any projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5250.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, for anything that's going on in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5252.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been getting phone calls, I get 45 phone calls, it's something we're gonna talk about later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5345.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what I'll do is I'll ask, what I'll do is I'll ask a request because I think what's getting out, because if you ask, there's a demographic that if you look at all the surveys and there's a demographic that gets the information and it seems to be one demographic, there's a lot of people, if you ask the common person in this room that's not involved with this, they've never heard anything about this because the message is getting out to the people that it seems like that are pinpointed to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5374.714s">[Scarpelli]</a>: direct mailers or groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5380.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5383.796s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I say this project, I'm saying as a whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5387.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm having calls from as a whole when we're talking about different surveys and things being done around the community and your office getting back to people and saying, oh no, we sent it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5399.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there are times that I'm in those same neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5402.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't get anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5403.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm a city councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5404.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that I can't, I can't not listen or bring forth what my constituents are bringing to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5431.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So let's talk about what we talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5434.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something that we were very excited about is hiring that zoning team and then bringing our vision of our development, our growth in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5444.466s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Remember, going neighborhood to neighborhood, involving everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5450.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5451.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Having community meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5467.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This council requested it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5470.236s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5471.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This council has requested it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9826.917s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just a quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9827.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What do the residents in Wilmington say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9844.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So will the residents of Wilmington know about this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9854.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, it's the same situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9857.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's really the same situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9858.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're in front of us today to hold something through that has to be accepted tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9868.474s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When a zoning amendment comes to this council from anybody whatsoever, you have to- I know that, but the way you presented it, it seems like even after this process, it seems like it's going to go pretty quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9881.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It has to be done right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9914.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One public meeting on it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9915.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9916.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when did we find out about it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9917.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When did your office find out about it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9944.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, these are things that, some things that just out of your control, but in the totality of these processes, it just doesn't look good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9953.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's no different than the voting situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9955.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It just doesn't look good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9957.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I consistently get,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9960.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: constituents that reach out and say, we knew nothing about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9964.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't hear this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9966.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so I think, you know, as a council, we need to figure out a way whenever we put these projects out, that there's gotta be some assistance that if they don't have the funding or anything that has to be done, because the biggest issues we have to come back to us are the constituents that they knew nothing about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9986.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I, you know, I, we, we had, we were fortunate enough with the last speaker, the last project that the housing authority did a lot of the legwork.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9996.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: on their dime or the way they processed it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9998.364s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is something that I'm hearing over and over again, especially the last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10003.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate it, and I understand that the situation's a little different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10007.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's just not fair, because I know what's going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10010.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to get phone calls tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10012.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The people who watch this will all have to say, you don't care about us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10015.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The answer is easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10016.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At least we know now we can say this is state mandated, and this is a situation, and it's out of our hands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10021.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it just doesn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10025.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: just doesn't look good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10026.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10027.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11060.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11062.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is unbelievable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11065.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're so excited about it, it's our neighborhood, and the only thing, I told my 20-year-old, John, I'll take you to the park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11075.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I mean, everything about it is amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11077.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, I'm sure, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11079.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hunt, this is one of the reasons, I got about 15 phone calls from the Butters that it's a really big dog-friendly neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11088.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they're confused that they didn't know about the process fully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11094.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is what, and they wanted to come here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11099.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, well, this isn't about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11102.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11103.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't know if there's something we can do to talk with them, set up a separate meeting with these folks that so they can understand the process that you, it was, I believe that the question was, could you do separate areas and construction?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11116.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't see that happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11117.77s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So from what I've been told, so I don't, but I think if that, other than that, I don't think anybody in this country is looking at that, what we're doing up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11129.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11130.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it's really bringing people back up the hill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11132.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, it, you know, when you talk about, you know, it's, it's re re re energizing so many different groups, you know, you have the baseball people that are saying, wow, you have, you know, you have new ball fields, we have multi purpose, we have, you know, you know, special needs, you have adults saying that looking for that apparatus park, I mean, this is something that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11154.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, I'm excited to say we're far ahead of Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11158.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, because this is what I do in Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11160.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The people are begging for this in Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11162.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is in planning stage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11164.33s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm so excited that we're seeing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11166.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I, you know, and I understand the process we have to go through, the funding mechanism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11172.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's nice to see ARPA money being used this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11176.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's exactly what, you know, you want it to be used for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11180.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11183.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, you're gonna get a lot of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11188.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The next two years, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11943.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We lost zero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11946.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This past week we lost a member of our teaching community at Bedford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11952.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We lost John Lazzaro, a former colleague and friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11961.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: John's had a tough last couple of years, but no matter what he went through physically, he still found his way to his classroom and to support his chemistry students and his science students from high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11978.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Great demeanor, he always had a sense of responsibility<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11986.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, confidence that only John had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11989.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, you know, we went through a lot of beginnings when we first started together as teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11995.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know his wife, Kay, is one of the best people in the world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12000.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they raised two amazing children, John and Elizabeth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12006.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know my son, John, went to school with Elizabeth and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12009.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's definitely, you can feel the void in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12012.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He also had a brother, Phillip, and his brother, Mike, who's also a custodian at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12018.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that he'll be laid to rest tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12022.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope that we can get word to the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12025.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope that they'll be lowering the flag at half-mast in his honor, because he deserves that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12033.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, to John's family, we feel your loss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12038.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll never feel the pain that they do, but he'll be missed for sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12042.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12376.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I own a solar company now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12422.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why don't you say something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12697.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Madam President, I know that one thing that I need to mention again is the commitment of the football program to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12707.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that shines brighter than any win we've ever had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12712.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's what's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12714.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Their commitment to the community and volunteering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12717.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12719.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They don't have to win a game for what they do with the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12722.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I applaud you guys for doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12723.945s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that coach Curley has to take a lot of credit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12727.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I also have done this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12728.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People have to understand if you didn't live in Medford, if you didn't go to Medford High School, if you didn't play a sport.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12736.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you didn't have the luck of having Steve Miller as your equipment manager at Medford High or live in that era, you truly don't understand what it means to be a true Mustang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12752.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, you know, Bud Kelly, he coined the term blue and white flowing through your veins and legitimately,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12761.574s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I, my freshman year, I wanted to cut myself just to see if I was, is it true?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12765.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because that's how much it would convince you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12767.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12776.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Don't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12777.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you come to the game next Thursday, you can buy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12785.453s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe blue and white t-shirt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12788.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I do believe blue and white, but I will tell you my point to saying this is that it's very different because when you hear some people say it, you know, Mustang pride, you know, there's some clowns that do do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12798.761s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's just a word for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12801.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we appreciate you, Chris, because I think you keep that alive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12806.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And and I think that's what you're seeing the change with these kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12810.509s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not just John Curley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12812.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12812.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Chris Murphy's energy to say, hey, listen, being a Method Mustang is part of life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12818.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12820.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're Method Mustangs behind this reel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12821.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's like, you feel like part of the team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12823.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what I think our whole community is lacking right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12826.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're forgetting that we're all Mustangs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12829.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And maybe if people lived like that a little bit more and understood that to be true, I think that it would stop a lot of animosity in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12895.168s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're all together as Mustangs supporting our team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12902.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, Nicole, I'll even buy a baby a nice little outfit, a little Mustang outfit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12907.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Chris, if you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13102.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was nothing better than listening to a group of Brazilian kids screaming defense while the offense was on the field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13108.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was nothing better than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13110.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have other things we should celebrate, but we should be celebrating<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13114.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The fact that our marching band won the championship and came in this community, I love the fact that they had the police escorts come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13122.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are things we should be celebrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13124.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have so many great things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13125.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what elevates us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13127.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thanksgiving is a good start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13149.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have it right here for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3315.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3315.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First of all, what I'm hearing is, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3321.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: from consensus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3322.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, there's a lot of people that say that our friends at Oasis are hardworking people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3327.705s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I do hear is that there is quality of life issues that deal with someone in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3335.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I find it hard to believe that it's all Oasis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3337.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I find it very difficult to believe that we can say this is all Oasis's fault.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3342.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think again, I think that this is the Antonio brings the point that's very important here is the enforcement I had multiple neighbors call me this week about this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3355.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it didn't just start it started with Oasis but then it continued on about the lack of enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3362.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in the streets of South Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3365.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what I see that are issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3368.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I do think that there are compromises.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3373.69s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As I did my study, I looked at the restaurants and the different bars that are open in the area, and there aren't too many that are open that are budding neighborhoods like Razo's or Bocelli's that are open till one o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3394.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's something we have to wait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3397.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I think where we're talking about many people have come up and said that legally we have to really what my recommendation tonight so we table this until we have a committee the whole meeting then maybe we can what that happens we can ask legal representation to me with the council to give us some direction and what we can and what we can't do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3421.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll give you some examples we.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3425.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't approve a gas station from BJ's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3430.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we gave the wrong reasons why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3432.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then what happened was BJ's came back because we didn't have legal representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3436.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They sued us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3438.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They won.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3440.362s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had to go back to court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3441.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now guess who's suing us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3443.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3445.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The residents are suing us because we're stuck in the middle because we don't have legal representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3449.51s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't had a city solicitor in a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3452.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're not lawyers, we're elected officials that are trying to do best for our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3458.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that we've got a report from our building department that our code enforcement officers are doing the best they can, unfortunately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3471.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the size of the city that we are now and what's going on in the city, only having a few enforcement officers, it's very difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3479.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3481.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Parking, we know that's a huge issue, huge concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3485.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have family members that live on Princeton Street that call me all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3488.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They think because I'm on the city council, I must own a tow truck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3492.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I understand completely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3495.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, this is a parking lot that is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3501.272s">[Scarpelli]</a>: open to the community, and there are no limitations other than making sure commercial vehicles aren't parked in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3509.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I, you know, is there something that the residents can talk with the owners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3515.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we table this and come back and say well, maybe there's something that you're looking at, maybe Friday, Saturday and Sunday till 12 o'clock if there are church groups that are coming in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3524.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe there's some kind of compromise that, you know, we'll can all work together to see what we can do what's best both for the business owner, and for the residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3533.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, I've worked directly with a few people that are sitting in this auditorium about Oasis and their lack of cleanliness and they don't put the barrels out and the trash truck comes at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3545.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to be honest with you, they've done a great job since we met with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3552.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I haven't heard the same complaints from different people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3557.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's maybe one or two of the same people that are complaining.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3561.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and maybe they have a right to, but the truth of the matter is they're doing the best they can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3565.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, the alternative is imagine if they're not there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3570.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're seeing empty storefronts everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3574.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's what we're concerned about as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3577.16s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So trying to find that compromise, I think might be the way to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3581.02s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I'm not saying we should or we shouldn't because legally we don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3586.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my recommendation truly is going to be to table this until we have a committee of the whole meeting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3592.427s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with city administration, with all the parties involved, our code enforcement team, our representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3609.436s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My motion, table this until we have a better understanding legally of where we can go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3616.839s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We all have our thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3618.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We all have our thoughts if Oasis was maybe a couple blocks away where it didn't, but a home, homes, they would say no, they're thriving, we don't want Oasis to leave, we need to have them, give them anything they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3632.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, but then you have residents that are saying, listen, I mean, we had issues with, first it was, I remember the first phone call I got was the trucks are revving their engine in front of a window, keeping their engines running while they're running in to get something to eat in front of a resident's baby's bedroom window.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3650.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we stopped that completely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3651.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We ended up moving with the city and Oasis, we ended up bringing in planters, gigantic planters, so they couldn't park up on the curb.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3659.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's just discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3662.293s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe it's just a discussion we can have again, and see what we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3666.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I you know, and I'll do respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3669.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You don't have control of your clientele, but you do have control of your people that work for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3674.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if you guys if we can all sit together and try to find a way that we can fix that, and help the neighbors and be part of the neighborhood community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3682.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if it's something that we're bringing in the traffic enforcement saying, well, we need resident parking only.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3688.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the nights that we're going to that we would allow Oasis to have a certain extended hours of operations that we make sure that there those parking spaces are open for residents at 10 o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3699.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's got to be something that we can work with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3701.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I'm only saying this as a way<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3705.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to a final answer that can help everybody here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3708.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I that's why Madam President, if I can, I'll make the motion that I feel we need to table this and move this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3716.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have all the representation at the table, including a legal representation that can guide us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3721.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I hate to do it, by the way, I voted, I voted against everything that had to do with a representative for from KP law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3730.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we're paying them hundreds and hundreds of dollars just by picking up the phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3735.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hate that we have to ask them, but because we don't have a city attorney in the city for a year, I think with this situation, I think it's warranted because either way, I don't wanna make a decision either favoring or being against without knowing the true ramifications legally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3750.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I hope you can understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3752.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's why I make the motion that we table to a committee of the whole<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3756.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that, you know, we can even make it within the next 10 days if we can, that we asked the city to the mayor to have legal representation, be present to answer our questions and hopefully we can make a reasonable decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3770.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And maybe in that time, maybe the respected owners of Oasis who I feel that every time I've talked to them, they've been very, very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3778.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've been very, very welcoming and understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3781.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we have people that are definitely committed in our South Medford community, that maybe there could be some kind of discussion that we can say, hey, let's find, let's find a common ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3790.69s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then let's, let's revisit this when we can a community of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4893.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the respect Councilor Bears, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4898.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I just want to, I think that one of the biggest pieces, I appreciate the owner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4903.651s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's a great compromise, but I also think that there are,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4908.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: bigger issues here that that the city needs to address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4912.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, the traffic, the traffic issues, the, we have our special services department, they're all here and I know they work probably at hours a week, but they've been sitting here for the last three hours and having them understand the process<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4932.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and what their relationship with Oasis, so we know how you've been in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4938.913s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think they're, you know, this isn't beating a dead horse at all in my eyes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4942.016s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is trying to get the best case forward for something that, again, I, as one Councilor, don't feel comfortable making until we have legal support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4956.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like, so again, I, you know, I would, I would still like to go to date certain for our next open meeting to extend it there that we can ask a representative legal representative, I think the owners of Oasis and here's the thing on the people that are against it and the people that are for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4978.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we don't find a compromise, someone's gonna lose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4981.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that we need to maybe find some, some common ground that maybe in two weeks we come back keep this extended for two weeks, and then put it first in the agenda, ask those questions and then vote on it, because I, you know, I, I feel that I can't speak for anybody, but I feel that the majority of the council is in favor of it, but I also think that this is an opportunity for us to meet with the administration,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5005.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: bring in the MPD, bring in the traffic, talk to Inspection Services, ask DPW about the upkeep and what's going on there and about signage for the parking lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5016.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and permits for maybe the drivers that can park there until 12, and then close it and resident only that could park in there then tow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5024.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's other things we can use this meeting for to find the best avenue for the community and self-medical, including Oasis, because this isn't going away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5033.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we give them the permit three days, guess what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5037.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The self-med residents are gonna come back and say, Oasis is doing this again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5039.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5041.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5042.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But let's try to solve this instead of just pushing it through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5045.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's wait a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5046.364s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's bring everybody in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5047.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's let's have the parties work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5049.945s">[Scarpelli]</a>: See what's best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5050.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Come back to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5051.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's put something thoughtful on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5053.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have to talk about it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5055.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Listen, I'm sure you don't want some of the emails you get from some of the people that email you every single week about issues in South Meffin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5061.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We could sit everybody at a table to figure things out right now to get a better understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5067.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would welcome that, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5069.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it's voted down, it's voted down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5071.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But that would be my motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5073.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5084.582s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our next regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5198.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5199.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Ask the people, ask the people, the neighbors at BJ's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5203.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, but the good advice we got there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6014.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6015.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, moms demand action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6018.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I remember a little organization when I was young that started up by their moms was a program called SADD, and it virtually eliminated drunk driving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6027.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's something that, luckily, it's just second nature for our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6033.29s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They just, we don't see that anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6036.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as much as we used to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6037.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that, you know, being Councilor, being Councilor Tseng is one of his teachers, I remember going through those training sessions and bringing kids into the into the lockdown areas and going over this and watching how crazy it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6050.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then here we are today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6051.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, my daughter's 18.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6053.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's graduating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6054.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the whole process is second nature to her now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6057.541s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's sad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6058.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's sad that they have to live this life this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6060.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I appreciate when moms take take action like you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6064.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6065.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: do just a little piece that makes such a big impact, because studies have shown a lot of gun violence death, especially at the youth level, comes from kids taking their parents' guns and playing with them, and self-inflicted, or taking them to school and hurting others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6081.171s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, to reiterate what I said, thanks for bringing this forward, but keep the good fight going, and whatever we need, the council's behind you 1,000%, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6487.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6490.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6578.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can, can each of the members that are here, can you come to the podium?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6581.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you can, I know that we don't want to, if you, I think everybody should know who they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6587.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if you just give your name and the year that you are currently in right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6606.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm Matthew Harrison, I'm a junior.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6609.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Congratulations, and again, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6616.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The reason why I asked you to do this is twofold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6619.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we have our athletes, after they win a championship, we ask them to come up and we recognize them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6623.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we have our leaders in the theater, our arts, we ask them to come up and identify them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6629.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think it's important that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6631.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You started now a legacy and now it's a tradition that's going to carry on because I hear we're all into classman so we're all coming back next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6639.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have a dynasty at the vocational school so I will share something with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6646.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I will start it off by the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6648.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the trip to, I believe it's Colorado, we're in need of some funding, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6653.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think, so I'm not going to say how much, but I'm going to start, I'm going to ask the community if we could find a way to help, just reach out to the high school or or the clerk to see if we can reach out to anybody who'd like to donate to help with their cause.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6667.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm going to donate, I'll be the first one to donate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6670.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll talk to Mr. Campbell, one of the parents, to help out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6673.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that, you know, to get the ball rolling, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6677.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you deserve to be in Colorado to represent the city of Medford and our schools and such an honor for you to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6684.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6858.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I did, I know Mr. Puccio is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6862.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that, let him speak, but I think this is an amazing event, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6946.716s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6947.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First of all, Miss Butcher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6948.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6949.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, um, there's still a little undertone of disgruntled Italian Americans in the city method for reasons I won't bring forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6958.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But these are the events that bring everybody back and put everybody in the right frame of mind, and we really appreciate you taking the forefront and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6974.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's wonderful, you know, with this wonderful event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6979.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I move approval with the food truck and ask my colleagues to support as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6987.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7675.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: development is progressing method, but I'm just a little leery that this type of zone changing for individual parcels is what really affects our community in a negative way in the sense that, unfortunately, we don't have a true understanding of what a whole picture looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7697.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, when you look at neighboring communities and they said, we'll use, we'll use assembly row.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7702.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was a whole vision that wrapped around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7706.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I don't feel comfortable doing is approving his zoning change right now for one building right now, and not knowing what the rest of the picture looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7715.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was fortunate enough to start with Mayor Curtatone and working with him and seeing what he did when<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7721.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh geez, Ikea had the number one spot back in the day in assembly row, then all of a sudden the vision started changing and started conforming and they had to find a way to move Ikea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7732.177s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My whole, my reservation with this is really making these spot changes in zoning to accommodate certain groups without truly understanding, and I know we have a long process to go, but that's probably one of the most dangerous<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7749.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: intersections in the country, and the residents in the Wellington area that people seem to forget about, where you're gonna be bringing in, how many units is that right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7762.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7763.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now imagine adding that much without understanding the true impact with the whole community there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7771.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7771.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's where my reservation comes in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7773.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So believe me, I love the idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7776.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I see if there was a comprehensive plan to see what it all would look like together, and that's what I'm sure in your profession, you see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7784.407s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's why you're here right now because we have such an outdated zoning format that you have to come up and ask for this ridiculous format so I just have to be honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7795.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I love the idea it looks beautiful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7797.779s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just right now I.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7800.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, again, that the understanding of what the true impact means the rest of the growth there and what impact it brings to, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7811.353s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, the negative issues it brings to that Middlesex area, the Wilmington area, I couldn't support it unless, you know, we had our Office of Community Development and people sharing, I don't know if Alicia's on the line, just even understanding what the vision is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7829.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, again, that's, we call these, you know, what was the big thing back in the day is gateway communities, gateway entrances, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7836.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a gateway that's coming in from Everett Rivera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7839.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a very important piece right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8181.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8181.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hunt, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8183.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We appreciate all your hard work and we know you're super busy,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8186.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: moving forward, I would love a conversation to share that vision with us so we can all celebrate in what we're trying to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8196.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is what the biggest concern we're having with the administration is understanding that obviously the zoning isn't going as quickly as we want it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8206.233s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the representative to your words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8208.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it meant a lot to me, understanding more what you're saying as our leader in the office of community development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8215.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that maybe if you could moving forward is, you know, share those ideas with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8221.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it would go a long way to at least moving my decisions forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8226.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And because that's the issue is we do need housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8229.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The issue is we do need the development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8232.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need the new money in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8233.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's something we've always been,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8235.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: crying out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8236.18s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same time, I think understanding what the vision is, and understanding that we could be great partners in this, at least all of us, not just individual Councilors, but all of us to make sure that we're all celebrating in this and moving something like this forward, I think will be helpful in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8254.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8255.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would move, Madam President, that we move this to the next step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8324.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, for one Councilor, I'd rather you be a little premature and reach out to us for the fact that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8331.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've worked with other communities and seen what they're doing, and there's a partnership there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8336.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sure this was something that the city was working with, must be months now, because this doesn't pop up overnight, and you got it last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8345.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my hope is only that you share these visions with us so we can help move things forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8353.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think it's negative in any way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8355.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't try to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8356.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not trying to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8357.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if you can, just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8360.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, be a little premature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8361.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd rather you be a little premature because it would help us moving this forward a lot quicker and understanding it, at least a big picture and a better vision to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9885.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a former negotiating member of contract as a teacher and a active member of a negotiating team municipality, that is absolutely appalling what I just heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9900.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That just tells you, and it should be a shot across this community, of where we are in the leadership of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9908.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now it's sad because we're gonna get phone calls tomorrow saying, what are you doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9912.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't political.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9915.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I keep telling people we don't have a newspaper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9917.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have an avenue to share what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9920.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the only forum right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9923.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you were here earlier that six o'clock meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9926.692s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was it was our council's wish list go over the budget, our hopes and budget for the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9934.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I was so demoralized as I got went through that mental process to see what I needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9941.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9944.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's you're always overlooked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9946.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're saying that you're not getting paid, but I want to ask you a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9950.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have plenty of staff in your offices, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9952.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9953.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, you don't, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9955.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's abundance of employees that are DPW and your secretarial team way understaffed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9961.02s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you're not only are you not getting paid what you deserve, you're doing the job of two to three people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9967.364s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here's the funny, here's the funny piece cause I can see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9970.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9971.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We vote no on the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9974.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In 45 days, they have to pass it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9975.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They have to run on a different budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9977.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Guess who'll have to do all the work to get the new budget prepared?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9980.051s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The secretaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9983.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9983.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what's so moronic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9987.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's scary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9987.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I, for one, as a union member and part of a municipal team,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9995.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have not voted for any money paper, let alone increases for the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10002.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have they gone back to the administration, taken down salaries?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10006.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have they done that to the administration staff?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10008.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because they're okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10012.099s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, for the ones that are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10015.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just find this very, very frightening that people have to understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10020.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In a normal negotiation, you have a representative from the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10024.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And a lot of times when you're at a crossroads, then your mayor steps in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10029.928s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A lot of times when I sat in negotiation, you had city solicitor who would come in, the representative from HR or your HR director, department head, who's in administration, working with each individual unit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10044.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and you find that common balance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10046.526s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You look and negotiate for trading language for percentage, trading longevity for other options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10056.575s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is how you work it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10058.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What my frustration that I need to share with all of you is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10063.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We truly don't know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10066.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the financial outlook of our community in a few weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10069.494s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know where we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10070.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't seen any projections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10073.016s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't seen any pre-budget stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10075.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't seen anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10076.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All we hear are rumors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10078.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We hear that the school committee got probably one of the biggest budget pieces in the community, the biggest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10086.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We were told that they got a letter, the school committee got a letter saying that we're looking at huge cuts and layoffs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10093.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the teachers called me and says, well, is this why we got what we got for percentage so they can cut everybody?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10100.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what I fear, what we don't know, we don't know what the budget's gonna, I'm afraid of as bad as it is in city halls, bad as it is out in the streets and the roads and the parks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10115.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know where we are, but I will tell you,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10119.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in negotiations as a school team member, as in negotiations in a municipal department where I work as a city councilor, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10130.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Fagli, I understand exactly what you're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10133.761s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm willing to stand with you and say, hey,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10137.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's start off this budget meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10138.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's start this process off by saying, hey, if part of the budget process with the city council isn't making everybody whole and making sure everybody's on the path to make sure that they're supported and they're shown the respect they deserve, I'm willing to stand with you in any day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10158.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10159.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm willing to do that any day of the week with all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10165.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10168.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Where, what I'm, what I have, my disappointment, my fear is that we don't know where the climate, financial climate is in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10179.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know Councilor is saying, we would love to, I agree with you, let's use that 25 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10184.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we have a resolution out asking, where did this 25 million come from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10189.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one's told us yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10191.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10192.051s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the fact that they have KP Law and everything,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10197.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: issues at the school department, handling personnel issues, school department, handling negotiations here, fighting for taking away 40B projects and development in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10210.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10212.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't a political ploy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10214.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is me venting and talking with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10217.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the city, how do we move forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10219.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hate talking like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10221.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hate being negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10222.69s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want solutions, but I'm telling you, your frustration is our frustration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10228.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We tried to hold a meeting with the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10230.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council President worked her tail off to make sure that she worked with the school committee so we can sit down before this budget season to talk about what's happening at the high school, security issues, future budget concerns, other issues that we need to talk to so we can sit down in a room and work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10246.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We got word back that the mayor didn't want to meet with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10250.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We got word that the mayor didn't want to meet with us because she was afraid of the dialogue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10255.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's the mayor of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10258.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's funny, know what I'm hearing from people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10260.368s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know the only way you can reach out, George?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10262.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Start a Facebook post.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10264.171s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's start a Facebook newspaper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10266.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's whatever she puts out, you know, with Run Like Girls or any of the programs or whatever fluff that's going out there, the signings and the ribbon cuttings, let's put it to what's really affecting Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10281.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I'm afraid, July 1, I'm afraid July 1,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10287.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to be talking to parents about classroom sizes being too big.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10292.579s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to be talking about special needs parents of their children that can't have the services they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10297.98s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to talk about the three DPW workers in the parks that have to cut down to two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10303.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to have to talk about the 80 police officers that they have to cut down to 75.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10306.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's my fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10308.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10309.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one's dispelled that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10311.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one's told us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10315.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The only time we have anybody from the administration here is the chief of staff to call us bullies and tell us that, you know, sticking up from here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10322.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're wrong, she's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10326.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In the meantime, we're falling apart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10329.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're falling apart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10331.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You saw just what happened today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10334.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had questions with legalities that should have been taken care of in five minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10337.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we had someone, it would have been done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10339.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't had a city attorney for a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10341.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know what the dialogue is from the main, the administrator's office, is that it's very competitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10348.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just so I've talked to, I've talked to eight city solicitors sitting at a table at a memorial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10355.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I asked them, jokingly, hey, come to Medford, we'll get your top dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10362.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they were like, George, not if you gave us the key to the city, that place is a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10369.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's not just here, it's everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10372.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So long story short, I don't care that I'm venting anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10378.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At least I get some sort of satisfaction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10381.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I get yelled at when I get home by my wife, but I'm telling you, we appreciate what you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10385.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're gonna support whatever you ask me to do, I'm gonna do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10389.651s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I'm at that point, if you're frustrated, I'm frustrated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10393.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I grew up in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10395.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I did everything I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10396.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I got four jobs and bought a house in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10399.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I did whatever I could do to stay in the city, to make my kids go to the public schools in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10405.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've gone through McGlynn and Burke and now Lungo-Koehn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10410.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10414.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to hear the dialogue that her mission is to clean up city hall, holy cow, if that's cleaning up, I'm frightened to see what's next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10424.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I apologize, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10427.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are tirades that I'm getting sick and tired of myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10430.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I say it, my ears hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10434.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it has to be said, because you know why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10437.311s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the regular person that all they have is this evening to watch us talk, they don't truly understand what's going on in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10444.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10444.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11803.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for being here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11808.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want you to know for one Councilor, whenever you're standing in front of us, there's a sense of legitimacy and honor when you're here so I appreciate when you're representing any client so appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11835.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I, you know, you've been here, you were here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11837.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, our biggest issues is making sure that we make the right decisions legally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11842.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that understanding that this process and what it's intended for is what, you know, getting phone calls from people asking, you know, what is this for another auto body place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11853.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that having that clarity, just making that part of the record, if we could,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11858.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that this would be only an auto repair, and the license will stay with, it won't carry on to any, the new owner, that'll be identified just for this owner, and that if it's, she moves on, that the permit would die with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11877.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if that's legal, I can't believe I'm gonna ask your opinion as a legal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11883.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I don't want to hold anything up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11888.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11889.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we want to make sure with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11890.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then I know that the fire chief did put down that, this is a confusion piece, the legal piece that I have, no obvious violations observed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11900.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But then he leaves a note, this is not ready for final inspection yet, 424.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11908.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you know what that is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11973.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so I know that I appreciate that for the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11975.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11976.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I have been getting phone calls from representatives of National Grid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11981.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I guess there's some sort of is the city engineer on online?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11989.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so I know there was there was concerns about, you know, the National Grid<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11996.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what they're putting in for service and approval isn't what's to the acceptance of our new engineer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12006.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't know if they're falling into that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12008.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's a question I was gonna ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12020.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, so they haven't come to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12021.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12022.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12035.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12036.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's not coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12037.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It'd have to come in front of his body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12038.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have no, I have no further updates on that one because.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12042.29s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why I just, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12046.671s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Clerk, I didn't wanna put you in the spot, but I hate that we're holding businesses up, not just this one, but with national grid that maybe, I mean, it's not gonna help sway me in any way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12057.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm gonna see everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12058.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would move forward approval as stated with those pieces in writing that making sure that it's just a auto mechanic shop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12069.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And obviously the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12072.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that the permit stays with, that disappears with the... With the petitioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12079.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much, Mr. Beaton.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=77.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=78.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=79.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=81.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just wanted to send congratulations to one of methods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=86.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Greatest couples.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=87.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You could still see them driving down Lawrence Road or Winthrop Street in their Cadillac going really slow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=96.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Mrs. Brady.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=97.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, they're a great example for all of all of us as they're celebrating the 70th wedding anniversary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=105.436s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, two amazing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=108.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: amazing people that have done so much for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=111.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, the Children all involved in Medford, um, whether it's coaching or, uh, um, giving back to their community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=123.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've done an amazing job and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=126.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: great Medford people and just wanted to wish them a happy and 70 more years on their wedding anniversary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=215.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he outlasts you at all the polling locations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=731.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One question we had, what are the other restaurants doing in that area?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=736.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's very similar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=738.105s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Ours are very similar for what this business is asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=743.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything is in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=744.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've had no complaints to date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=747.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I wouldn't hold this off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=751.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that if we can, we usually do some sort of review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=755.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: maybe a 30 and 60 day review to see if it's had any negative impacts to the community, the neighborhood, but I would move forward with this in favor of that, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=855.824s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=951.477s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=952.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=952.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that when the request came in for the new ownership, change of ownership, nothing changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=962.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But unfortunately, at the time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=965.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that with new management, the prior permit went with the owner, so we requested for you to come in and you've done everything that's needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=976.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we had one, as we went through the process, just one thing you should take note of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=982.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=985.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: there's we haven't had many complaints at that area we'll ask for another 30 60 day review with the new ownership but at the same time there was one question about some cleanliness around the area especially in the later hours when other businesses come in the next morning there were some things that that were left you just want to make sure that that area is maintained<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1006.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there's some oversight there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1009.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Other than that, with the 30 and 60 day review, I would move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1013.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything is in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1015.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, this has been an existing business for many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1020.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the hours of operations, it wouldn't be fair to change those now for what was established for many years in that location with the same business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1798.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1799.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And thank you for this new initiative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1802.539s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I revert back to what we've been talking about for four years now and the lack of a true comprehensive plan of what vision<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1812.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what our city's true vision is, and when we talk about development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1816.159s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talk about all this, we see all this movement, like the spot development, whether it's looking at Mystic Ave, whether it's looking at the Apostle at Wellington and the air rights, whether it's looking at Medford Square, which we have, I think we already have hundreds of thousands of plans that are already written that we haven't looked at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1837.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think what we're doing right now is we're allowing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1843.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the city and really one department to make a decision what's greater for our community without the true input of what the community wants and the visions of what they see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1856.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've been screaming this for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1859.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's funny that we're a few months away from an election and all of a sudden we're being talking about Method Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1867.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: truly, I can't support this for the fact that we've been asking for a true comprehensive plan of what we want to do as a community, what direction we want to go in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1876.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we've been talking to Director Hunt and her department about putting in teams to come in and go to neighborhood by neighborhood and giving some direction of what we see and what we think Medford needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1893.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because right now, we're a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1896.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can't even drive into Medford Square without sitting in 45 minutes of traffic to get from one side of the city to the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1905.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So until, I appreciate the input of the knowledge of acquiring what the DIF is, but I think truly until we have a true comprehensive plan of what we envision Medford to be,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1923.18s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think this council should approve any sort of ordinance that approves anything until we understand what one piece will do to the other piece of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1934.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still haven't had these talks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1935.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't had, have we sat down with the mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1938.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Has this committee sat down with the mayor and talked about a comprehensive plan of what direction we want the city of Medford to go in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1945.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1946.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't, we're a few months away from election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1949.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We wanna talk about redoing Medford Square, cause it looks good on a flyer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1954.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just think that we need to slow down and do this the right way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1959.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I say this again, I remember when this disgusting area, when I started working 15 years ago in a neighboring community that people used to laugh at, it was an armpit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1972.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now it's one of the most popular,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1975.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: most exciting spots in Massachusetts to go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1981.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and that's Assembly Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1982.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now that's turning from Assembly Road down to Lowell Broadway, into Union Square, around the Highland area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1990.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a plan that they had in that community with the neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1994.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would sit in community meetings and we would look at what impact we would have with fire, police, recreation, what happens with traffic studies, everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2004.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We would sit together and we would create a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2007.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's how we grew that community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2009.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's why that community is so, so strong today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2013.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And why they have so much money they don't know what to do with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2016.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then guess what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2017.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A neighbor commuting next to them said, hey, that's a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2021.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's follow that same idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2022.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They got a little help with the casino, but now you're seeing that grow, that area grow, and it's growing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2030.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't see that here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2032.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because we don't have a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2035.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There isn't a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2036.258s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or if there is, it's a secret.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2039.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I'm not gonna move on to any, I stopped voting on money papers years ago because we still don't have true numbers of what the budget, the budget that was voted for this past year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2051.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We were told by the finance director those numbers were not true, but we still voted it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2056.456s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not going to vote on any money papers, and I'm sure not going to vote on any development issues right now until we sit with the mayor and understand what we have for a true comprehensive plan to see what direction Medford is going in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2070.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do we want to be Somerville?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2071.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do we want to be Winchester?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2073.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do we want to be something in the middle?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2075.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2075.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because right now, Councilor Caraviello has said it for years, we're the last piece of dirt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2085.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that developers can use now, closest to Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2088.264s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody else is dried up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2089.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They can't touch it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2091.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is valuable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2093.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To jump into anything because we got a grant for it, that's not responsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2099.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think that's responsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2101.11s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we need to see the biggest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2102.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Caraviello brings up a great point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2105.372s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Where does this ordinance, how does this play a factor in Wellington area?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2110.574s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How does it play a factor on Mystic Ave?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2112.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How does this play a factor in other areas in our community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2115.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And why wouldn't we use it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2117.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is a conversation that we're not talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2119.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're talking about things in little bunches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2122.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's do this little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2123.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's do this little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2125.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And nothing is truly getting done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2127.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why we don't have a true increase in our new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2132.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't see any of that, like neighboring communities have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2137.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have a true understanding with whatever growth we have, what it's going to do to our public servants and fire, police, DPW, and our school systems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2148.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are things that should be talked about as you start this process in Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2153.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2154.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we're putting the cot way ahead of this horse, saying, hey, let's get this done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2160.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: without understanding the true direction that we're going in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2162.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's why I appreciate the presentation, but I couldn't support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2168.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3251.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3252.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, this is a lively debate that I think it's interesting and it's informative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3258.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, it brings us back to the original question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3262.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this would be a great opportunity to use a great tool in our toolbox if we knew what the plan is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3270.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I love the idea that we want to work on Medford Square right now and use this tool, but understand something, without a true plan about moving one street and moving another street, how that affects the plan just right down the road on Mystic Ave or just down the road on Riverside Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3291.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or just down the road in West Medford Square, or just down the road in Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3298.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there are so many, if you look at what we're talking about here, it's a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3302.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a great tool in the toolbox.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3304.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The only problem is we don't have a toolbox yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3308.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one has anyone talked to anybody here because I haven't talked to anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3312.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I haven't sat with the team and said, this is our vision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3317.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a true comprehensive plan that the community is involved to sit down and deliberate and share their thoughts and where method's gonna go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3331.436s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor is putting thousands of committees and boards together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3338.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and these little bits and pieces like getting bit in the ankle over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3342.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It sounds great, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3344.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's a start, but start for what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3349.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What is it a start of?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3351.518s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because when you start something, there's a vision, there's a finale.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3355.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you have a starting point, your destination, your journey takes you somewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3363.666s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With this starting point, we don't know where it's going, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3367.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3368.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I all agree, we all agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3370.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a good tool if you had the opportunity to understand what we're looking at in totality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3377.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3380.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think it's just narrow minded that we're not thinking of the big picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3384.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're moving and changing things for the sake that you don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3389.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We keep talking about underserved communities and underserved parts of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3393.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know the impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3395.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: By changing this ordinance, you don't know the impact that's gonna have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3401.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You don't know the impact that it's gonna have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3404.73s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And has this plan talked about what happens with our infrastructure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3409.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have we talked about what's surrounded it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3411.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have we talked about the fire, police, teachers, the school department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3415.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I got a text this morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3418.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Schools are adding more kindergarten classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3422.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Classes are getting filled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3425.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and just keep adding it with no direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3429.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, this is a good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3431.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I agree with my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3433.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's a good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3435.165s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you had a plan that we can say, this is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3439.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the plan in Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3440.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is how it's gonna roll into probably one of the biggest opportunities we have, and that's Mystic Ave, especially along the highway side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3452.159s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have so many opportunities, but we don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3454.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right now, it's just people talking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3457.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's people talking and no one's, but there's no one leading us and saying, this is what we should do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3463.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's, we talked about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3465.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This council has talked with the development director and we've talked about putting in, you know, getting a zoning consultant in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3472.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've talked about getting a team in so we could sit down to see what zoning we want from Medford, what growth we want from Medford, what direction we want from Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3481.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if we keep changing these little pieces,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3486.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I use the parcel land we voted for in Wellington.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3491.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still have the air rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3493.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody keeps talking about the air rights with the T. Well, I found out the other day that the T wants that land.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3500.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The T's, and who's gonna get it first?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3502.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The T of the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3504.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who do you think's gonna get that first?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3507.756s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are the things I'm saying until we have focus on this in the back door, the T is coming in to negotiate what they want at Wellington station, where that could be a huge gateway to our community, what we want to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3520.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I appreciate everyone's input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3524.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a, it's a, it's, it's, it's a respectful debate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3527.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's, it's bring some make some great points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3529.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All I'm saying is I agree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3531.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That is a good tool, but I don't agree that we don't have a plan<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3537.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to use this tool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3539.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One part of the community that's small minded, that's narrow thinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3543.231s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to understand what we're looking at the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3546.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5131.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5133.427s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I was appreciate you mentioning that be nice that two years ago, we used to have a city solicitor that we can have here and help us as we go through this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5145.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had no idea that KP law would be here to help us along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5148.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we're talking about a very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5154.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, different situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5156.929s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, and I think that all we're asking for right now is just the opportunity to go to the next step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5163.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you know, the questions that people have in neighborhoods is, you know, as valiant as your, your, your, your heart and what you need is something that I would support in a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5175.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5176.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, this is something you took a chance on that land, but as your family grew,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5182.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to be a strong member of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5183.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, we've had a lot of obstacles and hurdles come in the way and you still want to be a strong member of our community with your family, and, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5190.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we should support this this evening and move it along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5193.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that they'll be hurdles along the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5195.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They'll be neighbors that are going to be mad about breaking ledge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5199.364s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They'll be neighbors questioning parking, and there's going to be questions about affordable<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5212.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If that's the question that we're just trying to move something down the road so we can maybe help a family that's in need right now, I think that we'd be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5224.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'd be speaking for myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5228.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would be foolish not to support a family that is looking for that support in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5234.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, we're not giving approval to build the Taj Mahal all we're looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5238.945s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council is asking for the family that we help them move on to the next step and then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5244.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we go from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5245.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's a no brainer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5246.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would move, um, if there is a motion that we need that I would move that forward this motion forward to, uh, to the next level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5254.794s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the house family can see if they can, um, support their family concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5259.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5362.096s">[Scarpelli]</a>: point of information for the ASKP law that if we amend this, that it would go with just the Alves family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5368.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it is transferred over, then that would, that restriction would have to come before the city council again at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5375.16s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I think that's an easy ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5376.52s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5392.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if we didn't want some developer to come in and put a ton of... Or we allow it to what the Alves family, the existing owner right now only.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5447.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, Matt, if we can, for clarity purposes,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5451.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for the simpletons in the room like myself, to the attorney, is it possible to grant the Owls family only for this purpose and not for the property or future property owners?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5473.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5486.64s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5487.02s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, again, this is just to build the process to go through the next step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5562.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One information, and again, but this is my, this is dilemma, the chicken, the egg kind of my, my concern would be the Alps families taking all the risks they're paying all the upfront they're doing, they're moving this for their family forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5580.888s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, as they move forward to restrict it and limit them for what they can, they can make on that part of their property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5589.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's a slippery slope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5590.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's already limited to none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5594.368s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I'm saying as you move forward, you also have a family that they just explained how, you know, as their family's growing with some need to restrict their possibility of greater growth to support their family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5609.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's, you know, that's a question that I'd have with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5615.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, that's why we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5739.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information, I know, but you're making this as if these were developers and I can understand that fight, but these aren't developers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5748.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are residents that have lived in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5751.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so I think there is a difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5754.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and I think the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5757.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the situation plays a huge factor in my decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5761.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I wouldn't, like I said, I would move approval for the deed restriction to be lifted so we can move forward with this and that it stays with the Alves family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5771.855s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That if it's changed after that, that then it has to come back to this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5776.796s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5778.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5779.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5966.005s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5966.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wish we had that much fire for developers that are destroying our communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5971.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5974.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'm hearing right now, this is the process to move it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5979.079s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then we could discuss with the fire department about what's needed or if it's even possible to move forward with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5987.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is a simple ask that would move this family's worries into a better direction and we'd get some answers that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=5997.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Moving this to another meeting is just,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6003.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: making this longer than it should considering all the processes that you just talked about can be moved into the next phase as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6011.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe I don't think this is anything that that's groundbreaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6017.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if we vote this forward tonight, that can't be adjusted as it moves forward for all of the different hurdles that residents have to go through when they're looking to, I believe it was support a family member, not moving him or them to outside services or into housing, but they want to look to take care of their own<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6042.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: on their own property and the property that they're requesting and without the burden to anybody else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6050.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's valuable and I would still support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6056.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I have a motion on the floor, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6059.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6905.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6908.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's come to my attention that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6911.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: our turf fields are in disarray.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6914.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And although we appreciate all the hard work going into all of these grant funded parks and playgrounds, I think our city administration has forgotten about the existing fields.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6929.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is something that I've been putting on the agenda for years, hoping someone would listen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6937.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, when I'm gathering from some parents, they're a little nervous, especially what's happening in Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6944.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The field is a turf field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6946.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The field does have black pellets, but the field hasn't been tested for GMAX.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6952.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now what the GMAX study does is it should be tested every year, this is what we do in my profession, on a turf and natural surface fields to make sure the density is safe after a long period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6965.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The Field of Dreams was started back in early 2010.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6969.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're now coming on to 2024, and the life expectancy of a turf field that is maintained properly, that means to come in and groom it on a regular basis, that means on a yearly basis, coming in and doing a deep clean, that means taking the pellets up,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6991.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: re-grooming the surface and then re-entering the pellets, which, from what I gather, we haven't done on a consistent basis here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7002.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What was brought to my attention, the way I brought this up, is that as soon as someone says safety to me, I have to present it in a resolution so the city can get back to us in a timeline that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7018.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: God forbid somebody gets hurt and those tests weren't done, then the liability, and if the attorney's still here, this would be great because I know if the city solicitor were here, I know that that would be something very important to stress the fact that getting that test done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7035.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, what I request is the city administration to have a licensed turf<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7046.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: contractor come in with a GMAC study for turf, not natural surface.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7051.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're two different tests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7053.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they do a test at Edgley Fields behind the high school, the fields at Hormel Stadium, and from what I gather, the field at the Brooks School is absolutely deplorable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7069.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's probably one of the most used playgrounds in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7075.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know our school age kids at the Brooks love that field considering what they had years ago and the mud bowl that they used to have to and then bring it into the school and it started destroying the floors at the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7091.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The community really put a good effort, but they forgot again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7096.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: an existing playground and park and Metro completely forgotten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7100.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unless you can cut a ribbon, unless you get a big grant to do it, unless someone does something that does some work to do that stuff, we've completely forgot about our regular fields, our fields that are still existing, that our kids are on every single day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7113.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7115.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would recommend, I would make the motion that we ask the city administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7121.304s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know if it falls under the facilities manager.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7124.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did we hire a facilities manager?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7126.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7127.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe that facilities manager, because at least in my role, we have a facility manager that actually oversees the parks as well as the actual buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7136.247s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If that falls under that person or the new, I guess there's a new director of parks that we can get a report back<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7145.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7146.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Kids are on those fields today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7148.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would hate for a kid, a young person to fall tomorrow at a game and smash their head on a on an area that hasn't been tested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7157.553s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we are held that first of all the safety of that that that young individual and then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7163.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what can happen later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7165.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a father of a son who saw a neurologist on a regular basis because of concussion issues, I take this very serious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7177.544s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one of the things, one of the most important pieces as we've gone through studies and now part of a working program that my son is actually involved in, that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7191.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: realizing the fields that he was playing on caused the concussions, not the head butting, not the physical bump to bump, but the actual falling on the turf as a goalie onto a turf that wasn't tested properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7208.164s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that we need to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7210.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We, I didn't realize until parents said, you know, have you gone up to the soccer field, soccer game, that these fields are terrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7217.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It looks like all the pellets are washed to one side, that, you know, that they're not safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7224.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I was a proud member of that committee that built those fields in 2010.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7230.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we asked for is putting a fee aside, an identified fee with every renter,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7237.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And over that 10 years, we would be able to replace that turf.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7240.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Obviously, no one followed through with that control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7246.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think the city management, the administration has to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7251.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: report back to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7252.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to, it could be done in two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7255.429s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's important that it's done in two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7257.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that they need to immediately go to all the fields, get the certified turf pro to come out to do those GeoMAX studies, and then go out to, especially from what I'm hearing at the Brooks, that the carpet now is, it's coming up on the scene.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7274.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now again, in my profession, a little maintenance,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7279.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to those fields, it's simple as this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7283.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Vacuum in the pellets, adding liquid nail down, patting it back down, and then putting a weight on top of it for 24 hours, and we don't have those dangerous issues anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7295.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then re-entering the pellets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7300.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's simple, but no one's doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7303.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we need, you know, I'd like to get a report back in two weeks if the clerk can make that as part of the motion, because it's brought to my attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7314.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now that it's brought to my attention, I think that we have to move on this quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7318.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And believe me, I would hate, I would hate to see what happens if they have to close those fields.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7325.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because we didn't do the preventative maintenance that we typically haven't done in our facilities so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7335.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I hope that answers that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7338.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope that you understand that, Mr. Clerk, and thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7378.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, especially in Somerville, because of the growth, and we're seeing that in Medford,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7385.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: natural surface fields have to have a resting period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7390.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to maintain, thank you, to maintain a natural surface field in the East Coast right now, it's impossible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7398.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unless you're an affluent community that has the ability to have six natural surface fields and rotate those fields.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7406.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you, I was directly involved, again, because of my son, the biggest concerns are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7413.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, the toxins that are in the pellets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7417.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we've done, we've had some major strides with looking at more environmentally safe products.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7426.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We tried coconut husks, then we realized we had kids that were allergic to coconut husks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7432.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what we've done in Somerville is now we use a soft wood pellet<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7437.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that has to be maintained on a daily basis because when it rains or wind blows, it pushes the pellets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7443.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it's safer for the environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7447.362s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's needed because we don't have many fields in our community that I work in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7452.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And believe us, I think we, I personally, I agree for a son that played Division One soccer and played soccer his whole life, I understand having natural surface fields.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7464.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what we all want but unfortunately in the east coast especially and being a city like Medford that's community like metric it's very difficult to maintain all of the youth activities and sports and um and do that i know that you know we've been very fortunate that you know that um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7483.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've had an athletic director that he's always been on the forefront of making sure that these tests are done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7491.035s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate that, but it's the trend that we're seeing, not just at the high school, we're seeing it all over the city and having the tools and understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7502.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And back in the day, there was always, I don't even know if the battle is over, who has the high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7508.466s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it the city or is it the schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7511.69s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't know if that's ever been, been, you know, delineated yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7516.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but again, like Councilor Bears, I know I could talk or buzz it off a meat wagon, but yeah, I wish we could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7522.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My preference is a grass field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7524.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, it's very difficult to have a grass field and use it the hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7530.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have one grass field in Somerville and we kept it at the Argenziano School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7535.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're ecstatic that we kept the grass field and we've had to condemn it because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7542.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, the dogs, um, dig up holes now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7546.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now there are so many, they call landmines, park landmines all over the city, all over the field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7552.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had to close that field down and, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7556.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, it's not, you know, like I said, we want it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7559.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We really do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7559.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We want one natural surface fields, but it's very difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7586.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, we can combine them if we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7598.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can't, if I, I'm sorry, Councilor, I just, I don't wanna, I just got information that the field was tested and they do it two times a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7606.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's good news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7607.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's great news that I appreciate the information that the information that I received was wrong and I don't wanna spread misinformation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7616.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's great news and we appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7620.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7661.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information, again, that poses another question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7665.115s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it the PACS department that rents those fields, or is it the Brooks School that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7672.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we should police that better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7674.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have two fields in our community that I work in that are only used for U-12 and under.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=7681.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: no adults can be on those fields and SPD know that if anybody's on there or the neighbors know they call recreation we send somebody down and we send PD down they just right from the car say please get off the field you have the permit and and that's probably the reason why it is this yeah and I say I you know I've gone there before and said that and I was I won't tell you what was said to me but um if you know that what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8140.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8142.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8142.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I appreciate your hard work because I know that that's the reason why I brought it up again, because it seems to fade and it's not fading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8152.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's getting worse with the rats and the rodents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8154.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8157.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's now creeping into parts of the community that you wouldn't typically see rodent infestation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8163.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're seeing them, you know, typically saw them around the sewer systems, but now you're seeing them in the ledge areas in different parts of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8172.293s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8174.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to really have the voice of our public health, our city DPW director, and really sit down and share with the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8186.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we've made some changes that we asked for our health department to want private property if you see a nest or colony or whatever they call it now, but people don't know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8201.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had a neighbor call me and they said they can't do this because it's on my neighbor's property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8208.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, no, we now have made some changes that we just have to get permission and we could stop those nests that are maybe on your neighbor's property, but they're coming into<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8223.221s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was, a neighbor sent a video from a home at Felsway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8227.423s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I tell you, I thought he got it from, I thought it was a video from a movie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8233.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he had a train of rats walking down his garden wall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8240.91s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he showed, they went right into a hole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8245.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it was, to me, it's just, we need to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8250.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: something that I know that can't be fixed in one day but we need a plan that involves every corner of this community because it's coming from everywhere you know you're not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8262.01s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, you're seeing it in West Medford, you're seeing it in Wellington, you're seeing it in North Medford, you're seeing it in South Medford, you know, you're seeing it in the Heights now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8269.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, you know, when you see it in God's country, that's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8285.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a great selling point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8287.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But thank you, Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8540.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm going to have to, um, if this is, uh, to speak on any changes to solar in, uh, as part of the discussion, um, I'd have to separate myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8553.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I do now own a solar company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8556.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, so I'd have to step away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8559.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8560.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8561.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: George Scarpelli does care about the environment, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8564.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why I'm going to separate myself from this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=8568.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9035.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First, I'd like to move approval on the donation, but just a little bit on Kevin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9039.544s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Kevin and I are colleagues now in different communities, but we often<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9043.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh, collaborate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9044.459s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, um, I don't think people realize how lucky we are to have Kevin here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9049.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, the adaptive program, I know I've been trying very hard for years to get it off the ground, and Summerville making sure that, uh, we are full inclusionary, making sure that all of our young people and adults have an opportunity to participate in multiple recreation opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9066.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, uh, you know, when you have, uh, a leader like Kevin,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9070.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: who presents these programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9073.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know he works very closely with partners across the state, and now you're having different organizations donating, and thank you for that organization to donate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9084.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's very kind of them, and I know it's gonna go a long way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9087.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd be remiss to say I'm a little jealous tonight because this, I believe it's this week,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9095.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Coming up soon, Kevin was asked to be a representative, I believe, to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9102.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: be the keynote speaker at the Recreation on the Statehouse and Kevin will be speaking on recreation and that's a huge feather in his cap for what he's done in a very short time with very limited basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9117.768s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To be honest with you, I can't tell you, I won't tell you publicly what our department and I won't tell you that I have 12 full-time employees and 100 part-time employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9129.313s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and to see what Kevin does with only three full-time employees and only a few part-time employees I think it's a huge feather in his cap and I think it's something has to be acknowledged publicly that when you are asked to speak at the Statehouse and out of all of the recreation departments<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9151.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: across the Commonwealth and having our director be that speaker, I think it should be mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9157.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not jealous, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9158.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not upset.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9160.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not, I mean, just because he's probably stolen a thousand different ideas from me doesn't mean that it shouldn't be me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9167.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But on that note... Do you have a professional crush on Kevin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9170.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm joking, I'm joking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9172.52s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I do I do but again I appreciate Kevin's hard work but I had to mention that Kevin I'm sorry I know you get you get a little embarrassed about that but when we call you out on stuff like that but again when you have such limited limited funding and limited staffing but still do what you do I think it's a has to be mentioned when you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9197.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as celebrated like you are right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=9199.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=61.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=64.041s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I apologize, I was talking to Councilor Villes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=70.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked knows my fault.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=72.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, is that Mr?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=75.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I apologize for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=77.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, we just recently lost another pillar of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=82.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A gentleman that, um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=84.963s">[Scarpelli]</a>: gave to the youth of Medford as a hockey coach and always happened to go to his services the other days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=94.331s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's Mr. John Garrity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=96.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Garrity was one of my favorite parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=101.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: His son Jay was my captain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=102.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: His son Chris played for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=107.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was always willing to help, never a negative word, whether he thought I played his kid too much or too little.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=114.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was just a good sounding boy, a Method legend in his own right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=120.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Listened to some stories the other day and hearing the stories on the playground and on the ice and playing pond hockey really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=133.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: summed it up what kind of person Mr. Garrity was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=135.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was a tenacious individual who loved life, loved Medford, and loved his family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=142.91s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that with the passing of his son, Jay, I know it was very difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=149.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Jay was a very big piece in a lot of people's lives, but I'm sure when a dad loses his first son, I think it must have played,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=159.913s">[Scarpelli]</a>: very big part in who he was after that and I know that he was a rock for his wife and I know that Mrs. Garrity is one of the leaders in our community in making sure that we don't forget the issues of drug addiction and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=182.779s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the Garrity family really keeps that on the front page and making sure that they're solid advocates for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=190.842s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we did unexpectedly lose Mr. Garrity a few weeks ago and just wanted to send our condolences to the Garrity family and he will be missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=203.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=382.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello and Knight for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=384.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that another great family metric, not just a camera store, but Hunt Drug now, if you wanted lessons, if you wanted to do different trade shows, the farmers are always willing to even come into the community to run programs for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=405.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=406.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, with, you know, Gary and I coach, I was fortunate enough to coach a great athlete in Gary Fava.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=413.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think he's missed a three point shot to this day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=416.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think Larry Bird's the only person that rivals him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=419.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that, you know, it is an amazing story of a local family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=423.969s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that have done amazing things, but what I really am impressed about is how they always give back, whether it be the veterans or school programming, and it's something that they never forgot their roots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=436.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want to congratulate them as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=437.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1688.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1933.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As such, move for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1936.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I second that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1987.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll present if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1991.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are projects that are already in place, and these are just the additions to finishing projects, something that's why we voted for the CPA, the great project, so move forward to approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3403.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information, Madam Mayor, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3407.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think what you're doing is unbelievable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3411.071s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What you're doing right now is a good example for the rest of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3414.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have to have a task force, just people caring about the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3417.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to hear that about, you know, Emory Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3419.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's people that are reaching out to us that unfortunately we don't have the court enforcement department we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3425.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3426.698s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5189.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a few different issues when it comes to our handicapped community and the lack of respect, whether they were having a city event and they're blocking handicap ramps or issues like what we're hearing tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5204.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, I know that the, I know that Neil Osborne used to have the position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5217.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is so frank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5218.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Has anybody can we actually make a motion to send that to Francis as well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5222.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think this is an issue to with the Disability Act that it's not just the T issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5228.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's just not, you know, a situation with with, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5234.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, Todd Blake, but this is also something that legally that the city has to get involved in, and we can send, you know, our enforcement agency to look at that as soon as possible to see if something could be remedied sooner rather than later, because if we wait for the T, they'll be building a blue line going through Metro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5256.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we could do that, I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5260.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5815.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5819.209s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to say it, but I'm going to say it, but I told you so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5824.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had an opportunity this budget season to hold the mayor's feet to the fire, and we didn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5830.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The answer to Councilor Tseng's resolution is very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5833.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's called a city solicitor, an assistant city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5839.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's unheard of in the state of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5842.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the city of this size, not having a team of city solicitors representing the residents, the council, of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5856.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're finally getting some redacted bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5860.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe it was last month, maybe you can correct me, I believe it was over $100,000 K.P.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5866.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5866.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe this month, last month that we just got, a slow month,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5871.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe it was another $60,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5872.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct me if I'm wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5876.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is money we're paying to a law firm that doesn't have to answer to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5885.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is what's frustrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5886.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are basic necessities we need that every city needs to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5895.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even tonight, some of the resolutions we're going through, we're talking about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5898.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm afraid to open my mouth because we have no legal representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5903.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because one one of our residents came up and said, Well, you're starting to pick on people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5908.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't disagree with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5910.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the fact that we don't have legal guidance to say careful how you say this, because you could be sued, because that's happened to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5919.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did we not forget that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5922.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're still in court with it with the BJ situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5926.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5930.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for bringing this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5932.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, for the neighbors, what's going on in that neighborhood is ridiculous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5937.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, again, the fact that we don't have code enforcement officers is another big issue, but we wouldn't know that because we couldn't discuss these issues at the budget hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5955.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the mayor got what she needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5958.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She got her four votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5961.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now here we are again, bringing up these same things and sounding like a broken record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5966.453s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I will tell you, I, on the school committee, we realized we had the toughest mayor that negotiates in years, and Mike McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5978.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when we needed things done for our school department, the school committee stood together and would not vote a budget until we got what we needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5990.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know people don't like to hear this, but that's politics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5994.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's part of the whole gamut of why we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6000.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This mayor is doing whatever she wants to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6004.761s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't see any benefit for our community, whether it's neighbors with Airbnbs, or whether it's a simple question that people, no one's picking up the phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6017.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm frustrated, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6019.373s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not as animated, because I think I'm getting tired of being so animated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6023.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, this is a very simple issue, very simple solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6028.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hire a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6032.716s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hire an assistant city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6038.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In most communities, that's like saying, breathe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6044.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7035.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7037.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think it's time to maybe make a motion that we become a little creative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7042.071s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that working with the building department, the inspectional service department, maybe working with the unions, maybe we ask the city administration and the mayor to sit down with those unions like they do with the police department and bring in retired police officers and maybe pay them to actively<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7063.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to go out and do, you know, assist with the code enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7069.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, you know, especially with our retired police officers, I think that might be an opportunity that we can think outside the box.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7077.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, you know, other communities use grant writers, bringing in grant writers and use grants that they would write to bring in money to our community and pay them through that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7089.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe there's an avenue there that they, you know, having some incentive that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7093.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we can, you know, do a few things at once where we're sending more people out, qualified people out, to understand our code enforcement and start, like our neighbor said, is start policing it better and giving them the avenues that we haven't given them at budget time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7118.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to make that form of motion that we ask the mayor administration to look into that process to try to immediately enhance the code enforcement office, both with the health department and the building department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7549.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, I think anybody that can be trained for that, Councilor Knight, that works with the union and the code enforcement department right now that can do something that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7560.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: can assist with these concerns and issues so we get ahead of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7981.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we could amend that too, Councilor Knight brought up a good point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7985.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Per diem payments<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7990.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to assist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7993.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, if you can add that to that amendment to that B paper that add that or either word it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8003.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8003.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8007.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As she's been doing, as the mayor has been doing multiple times in multiple positions in City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8012.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8950.663s">[Scarpelli]</a>: President, I appreciate bringing this forward as a strong union supporter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8956.424s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I support anything dealing with unions, but I,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8962.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would be remiss if I didn't bring up the fact that we're talking about, we're talking about RAs from Tufts University.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8969.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if I recall back, we talked about our own unions being affected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8975.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and Councilors that are sitting here talking about the effect that it had, you know, on the process of moving forward on a nonunion contract is because maybe we need to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8988.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to help things going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8990.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Remember those conversations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8992.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a fire department that hasn't had a contract in almost 800 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8997.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have secretaries that didn't have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9000.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a contract for six years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9001.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're talking about the RAs at Tufts University, a contact at Tufts University today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9006.613s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And boy, I tell you what, correct me if I'm wrong, free room and board, free meals plan, stipend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9016.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when I talked today with the representative of Tufts University, that's what they told me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9020.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not to say, I'm just sharing to you what they've told me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9024.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm just, and you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9026.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what I'm saying is this, understanding that, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna vote for this because I think any union, any person that wants to work together as a union and have representation, you can never deny it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9042.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I just want you to realize and understand<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9044.953s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's a good point to bring it forward that we have unions right now in our own backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9049.316s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My father always told me, don't worry about your neighbor's backyard till you clean your own backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9054.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 800 days, 800 days without a contract for a firemen and women.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9059.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They sat through the pandemic, the first ones they applauded how great they were, how amazing what they've done for our community, going into the homes where people are dying and putting their lives first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9072.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm using this, yes, I'm using it as a platform that I hope you understand why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9077.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's for the fact that we have unions in our own community right now in Medford, hardworking men and women residents that live here all year round that haven't been treated fairly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9091.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, two wrongs don't make a right, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9093.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm going to support this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9095.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's a very important paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9097.289s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's why I share what the representative from Tufts University told me today, so we can all understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9104.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the difficult part about negotiations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9106.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You hear what you want to hear, what they want to say, to make it sound good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9110.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But who's affected?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9111.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's the employee, the worker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9114.313s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I think we need to look at our firefighters, because I think, listen, unified message next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9121.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What can this mayor do to support our firefighters?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9126.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Update us right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9128.868s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the negotiations now are now in arbitration, it's out of our hands, but what else can we do for our firefighters that we're showing them the unity, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9140.29s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That they're standing together and saying, what are you gonna do for them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9145.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1313.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, I thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1315.096s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we've been getting messages back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1317.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is the reason why I asked for the extension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1321.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate you working with the neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1323.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, we know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1324.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know the neighbors are very happy with the the rules that you're putting in place your employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1330.169s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1331.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But so let's just so we can move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1333.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you're asking for the extended hours until 12 o'clock just for Fridays and Saturdays and Wednesday night and Wednesday night special<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1348.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is exactly what I was hoping for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1350.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we're looking at the conversation we had back and forth with both everybody talking in favor for you and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1359.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the respect that you have for the neighbors, the neighbors they have for you, my friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1363.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would, I know we still have to move forward, but so to be clear, it's Wednesday, Fridays, and Saturdays until 12 o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1371.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1371.98s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're welcome, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1375.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, what the question was, if it was going to be, you know, if we were gonna deny it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1382.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, in what grounds do we have to deny the special permit?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1386.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that with this resolution, I know we'll hear from the residents, but if we don't see any conflicts, I appreciate the council for being here, but we wouldn't need their involvement because that answer would be new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1401.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1414.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1513.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: D'Antonio, if I can, I know I asked for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1517.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for this meeting specifically because I didn't think that this was just the issue with just with oasis I think the enforcement was big so I recommended that we had legal counsel here, the police chief, the DPW traffic commission, I mean the traffic director as anybody else here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1539.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We should, I think we asked for the parking director also.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1541.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the parking director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1545.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I do not see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1546.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not the building, but really is really having.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1579.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, well, I'm a little disappointed because we asked him to come tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1581.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that was one of the reasons wasn't just, it wasn't just the community members and the business owners to talk and glad you did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1589.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the other reason why we call this because it was concerns of other issues that I think the enforcement was bringing in the negativity of the business owners<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1598.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: where we have to make sure that there's a plan in place, whether it's signage, whether we talk to the traffic commission, and do residents only from certain times or set up, you know, patrols in the parking lot area, and around the same time is the closing of the establishment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1616.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is the these are the questions I wanted to ask<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1619.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the the departments that are relevant to get us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1623.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1638.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so I think that'll be something we'll have to follow through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1640.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think for the neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1642.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the feedback that I got back from the neighbors was that, you know, really, is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1648.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is giving South Method the respect that they deserve and the residents there that they deserve, and making sure that there's some sort of a plan that the administration can work with the traffic department, the chief of police, and making sure that they step up dedicated patrols if that's what's needed in the evenings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1665.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think the piece that bothered me the most, the phone calls that I got, were the elderly neighbors that said that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1673.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the blocking of the driveways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1675.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to say that it was Oasis's fault, I didn't believe that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1681.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that the issue really is having the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1688.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1689.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that we need to, you know, I know it's not a popular thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1693.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when you throw a few tickets on a few cars, and somebody gets told because a senior citizen can't back up out of the driveway for an emergency reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1701.842s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's more important to me than any anybody's uncomfortable situation of going to get their their automobile out of impound because they didn't park and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1711.666s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a reasonable area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1712.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's something down the line we need to really call for a meeting, whether it be a committee of the whole or subcommittee on public safety, and really bring the neighbors back out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1722.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1818.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's part of the discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1821.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The part of the discussion with the owners, we're going to place signs not only in the facility, but also as they walk around toward the public parking area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1829.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe it's going to be in a few different languages, just for our Portuguese speaking patrons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1836.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1837.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's the, you know, and I appreciate that the general came up and talked about, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1857.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe community development?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1858.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1859.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1859.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1860.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To reach out to Bocelli's and I think Mace Cafe stays open a little later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1865.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So maybe reaching out to them, form a motion that maybe that the liaison to the businesses can reach out and see what they can do to make sure that they can post some signage or, you know, for their patrons to also respect that neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1881.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Could you please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1882.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2063.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not extended, correct, because that goes with the owner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2065.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So all this is just changing of ownership from one subway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2070.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2070.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2070.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The subway and Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2072.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2072.719s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2072.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is that you have only five employees that work for you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2097.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, I see everything in order, all paperwork's in order, so I would move approval after my colleagues have any comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2244.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2245.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This came about when the resident came to us who's been on the list, who lives in a private way who who's lived there for a long time in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2257.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: she planted a tree, a rooting tree in front of her establishment, her home, and she sat on the list for three years and was informed by a city engineer, I believe, and I was hoping he was here, but obviously he's not, that the city engineer has now followed through with the hard line, which is a law that the city does not maintain private ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2282.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will tell you I received many phone calls concerning public safety when it comes to these decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2290.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can understand when it comes to doing these bigger projects and understand our rules and regulations when it comes to private ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2297.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We understand that one of the biggest reasons that we don't receive enough funding from the state or the federal government is because Medford has, what people don't realize, an abundance of private ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2311.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it really hurts our bottom line when it comes to road work in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2316.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if you talk to most people that own homes on private ways, they have a lot of pride and they maintain their homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2324.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this one person who has a very dangerous lip now because of a rooting tree and has been on this list, had now been told that this would not work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2335.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we need to clarify this because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2339.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The truth of the matter is, if someone does still trip and fall, the burden falls back on who?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2345.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not the resident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2347.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It comes back to this council and the city and legal action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2351.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if you see those suits that we've had in the past, 3,500, 5,500, these all add up to a pretty good number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2356.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But more importantly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2364.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I fear that it's going to be that elderly person that walks down that private way, smashes their head and God forbid passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2373.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think this is something that to just be passive about changing this rule as a new new city engineer, and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2383.191s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I wish he was here because I'd like to ask him some questions that the residents that did reach out to him from what I've been told was that it was very arrogant in his presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2394.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to me as a city employee, municipal employee, that person works for the residents of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2400.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's the biggest piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2402.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we need to have guidelines set by this administration, really informing the people in the private ways of these rule changes or not to rule changes, but the the the persistence of following those rules now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2418.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, I got a phone call from another resident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2421.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he said, Well, George, we live over here near Arthur Winthrop Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2426.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My neighbors and I, three years ago, followed the rule and we brought in a hot top company because the street was deplorable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2434.764s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they talked to these professionals and said, because this isn't a major way, you should use this type of top, this type of patch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2443.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They repaved the whole street on their dime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2446.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They did it right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2448.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then they're upset now because during the Winthrop Street project,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2454.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The city diverted all of the traffic where?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2459.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Through this private way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2462.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, because of the hot top that was laid, because of the trucks that drove down that road consistently, their street is now in disarray.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2473.316s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So their question that I wanted to ask the city engineer, if this is the case, what fair is fair, is the city now liable for repaving that street?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2485.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's a logical point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2489.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, when you're not talking, you're not communicating with your residents, this is a huge concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2496.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these are the things that are open-ended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2498.636s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I would make the motion that we ask the city administration to please set up guidelines to re-educate our constituents on the follow through now of our new engineer and the policies that they're now following through or not following through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2515.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and the fact that what if the city is diverting the public traffic into their private ways and destroying these roadways that have just been paved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2529.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I like to get these answered for these constituents because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2535.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The next step is they said they would come here and the eight people that I did talk to said, you could use my name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2540.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, you know what, let's see what the answers are in the follow through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2545.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I will tell you, for the residents that are listening,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2548.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is very frustrating for us because we ask these questions, not because we want to be rabble rousers because that's because this city administration has come up here and said, well, our, our, our directors, our directors in different departments are actually afraid to come to city council because of backlash or aggressive behavior.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2567.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is what we're putting office we're putting office to be their voice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2573.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's not an easy place to stand, but when you were elected or you're hired in a municipal field, that's part of your job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2581.763s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's your, that's part of your job requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2583.544s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Come here and answer these questions so residents can understand what the process is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2626.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we need more communication through the administration to really let our constituents know of these processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2636.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When no one comes up to answer these questions, everything's left open-ended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2640.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the frustration gets to a boiling point where we're seeing good people in this community putting for sale signs and moving out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2647.922s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that I hate to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2650.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And all it is sometimes is just simple conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2653.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You saw what we did tonight with a very, very, very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2658.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: productive business in our city and neighbors that had an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2661.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They got to sit down together because we opened the line of communication for them and they found the best avenue for both parties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2668.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these are the things we need in our community and I think the city administration is really failing us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2674.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3174.747s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, I think that the goal for this is really to educate the constituents, and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3184.842s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so I would like to see a community hall with those residents of private ways, get the word out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3190.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate Councilor Knight and Councilor Bears sending that information, but when you are living to a certain standard here, and you've grown up in a private way or lived in a private way, and all of a sudden snap a finger, the way that you've lived your life, things have changed now, whether it's right, wrong or indifferent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3216.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The residents that live in those private ways have to be reeducated and really have to acknowledge what needs to be expected as they move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3231.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If this is the way it goes, like Councilor Knight said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3235.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the I don't blame the city engineer in any way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3238.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I question his his behavior or his tone with what residents have told me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3244.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you know, I'd like I said, if he was here, I'd love to ask him but but that's the what I question with our our city engineer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3252.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, my question is really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3254.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you're making changes, sweeping changes that are really affecting our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3259.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And especially when it comes to public safety, when people are expecting their sidewalks to get done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3266.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because imagine if, like Councilor Knight said, you have a sidewalk that's panels lifted, you have an elderly parent that lives in your home with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3276.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're expecting the city to make these changes because they've been on this list, so they wait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3282.377s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now all of a sudden they're told that after three years you're top of that list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3285.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They know we're not fixing it because you're a private way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3288.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're changing our policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3290.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3292.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we need to meet with all of these departments and really set the tone with how to reeducate our private way residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3301.02s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then maybe they have to answer some questions about legitimate questions that were brought about on detours and sending heavy trucking that ruined a street that has just been paved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3313.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these are legitimate issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3316.169s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=91.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=92.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello for bringing this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=95.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, Mr. Howard wasn't just a gentleman who<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=98.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: who created an infamous breakfast sandwich.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=102.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's someone that fought for our country, that loved Medford, and someone that really cared about his community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=111.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Living up in the heights and working on the board of Little League, we'd find ourselves as parents preparing a field at 95 degrees, and without field, Mr. Howard would be walking toward you with two gallons of water just to make sure that we're hydrated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=129.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They'll show up one day and drop off a bucket of balls that people didn't collect and make sure the kids got back went back to the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=137.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I love the story back in the blizzard of 78, when no one can leave their houses, and you had elderly families that couldn't find.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=146.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a gallon of milk or half a loaf of bread, and Mr. Howard decided to ration off everything in his corner store to make sure everybody lasted through that difficult time in 78.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=162.304s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I send deep condolences to the Howard family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=164.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know Mrs. Howard is represented by a name on the corner of Fulton Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=173.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I ask the administration to, with respect, add Mr. Howard's name along with his wife in respect of that historical corner that I think everybody should drive by, walk by,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=188.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: ride your bike by, look up and say, wow, I wonder who that person was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=191.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you can know about what it means to be a true community member and what it really means to be a Medford Mustang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=198.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because again, I've said it too many times here, who's gonna take their place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=206.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People like Mr. Howard stepping, passing on, who's gonna take their place to pass on the legacies that great people from Metro made up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=216.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=544.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=544.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I blame my passion and my outburst sometimes on Council Maloney because I learned from the best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=552.761s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He would wear his emotions on his sleeve and he wouldn't be afraid to say what he thought he needed to say for what was best for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=560.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And maybe from time to time, the rumors that he might have jumped over the rail a couple times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=565.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but he had so much passion to make sure that the city of Medford was represented in such a positive light.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=572.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he was a person that would take care and work for anyone in this community, whether it was in the Wellington area, West Medford, South Medford, even though he grew up, he was over at Charter Nav.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=587.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: he really fought for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=589.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, um, it's a sad day that Mr. Moody's passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=592.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I know that he's left a legacy with Gordon and Sean and Bobby.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=597.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, three Children that following his footsteps and giving back to their communities and, um, someone I'm very proud to have known and learn from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=607.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, condolences to his family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=609.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=684.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=687.509s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First, business, everything looks like it's in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=690.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Personally, I'm going to be very upset because I'm going to be spending a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=695.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My daughter loves the establishment, so now that it's in our backyard, I think the family money will be spent at Boba Tea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=704.756s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So just take it easy on us, but- Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=707.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I look, I see everything in order, Madam President, and I move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=786.065s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=787.005s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I appreciate Chief being here this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=790.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we just had a few concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=793.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One that I know that as we're looking at our budget coming forward and understanding that we might have some issues with the fleet and seeing what we need to do, we can do as a council to try to help move things along if we need to need to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=811.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to make sure that you get all the apparatus you need for the safety of your men and women.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=817.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that'll be the first thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=821.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then I know that there were some concerns about benefits for new hirees, that we can shed some light.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=857.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Someone's here tonight, so I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=859.041s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if you can shed some light on our fleet, that would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1039.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you have any questions, I'll yeah, so I know that one of some of the residents are asking that why is there a Boston truck and I don't know if we said maybe there was a fire and they were covering and then someone said what happened with the Boston truck was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1090.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this, I'll say it, Chief, this seems dire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1097.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This should have been something that this administration should have asked for two years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1103.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is something that is, do we have a representative from the administration?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1112.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so that's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1114.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I look at that because usually when you present a capital plan like this, it's in the capital projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1122.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't seen, have we got an update?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1126.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that, you know, I know that the mayor put out that the station, Main Street stations now going under this, that, and the other thing, and that's great, but these are the things that frighten me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1137.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is great if we have a brand new fire station, but, you know, are we gonna be,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1143.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, rent in a U-Haul truck and throwing some ladders on the top, because we don't have fire engines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1148.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's what I fear right now, because as you're saying, two and a half years away, and we're in discussions about ordering them, I think this council needs to play a bigger role in this, Chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1161.507s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we need to make a motion that we need to have an emergency meeting, as committee of the whole, with procurement office, with the mayor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1171.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And really, let's try to figure out a way to get this audit sooner than later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1177.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, I don't, I know it's not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1182.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not a popular thing, it's tough to be up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1183.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it is, but from here, I know how dangerous your jobs are, and not to have the proper equipment that you need, whether it's turnout gear, whether it's fire trucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1251.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Chief, I appreciate everything you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1253.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know this is nothing on you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1255.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'm saying, sitting here, we've ordered fire trucks in the past with Chief Gilberti and this administration, the administration prior to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1262.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So originally this council was involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1265.763s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what I'm trying to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1267.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we're waiting for the 30 days and you're sitting with the mayor and she's putting something together with other different departments,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1273.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Guess who they have to come to to ask for the money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1275.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They have to come here and we know nothing about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1284.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a city councilor, what I'm saying, this is what I'm telling you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1287.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You don't have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1288.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm telling you what I see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1290.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is that I don't care what other departments don't have paperclips.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1294.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our firemen, firewomen don't have the equipment they need to succeed and be safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1298.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know it's not it's not popular for you to say it, but I can say it chief and it's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1303.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you we need to have an emergency meeting with the mayor to see where this council falls in to make sure we're in the loop to make sure that we can hold meetings<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1313.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to clear any funding that we have to approve to make sure this happens within 30 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1318.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all I'm trying to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1320.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm only saying this because I'm in your corner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1323.764s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want to support your people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1328.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1329.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: working here for 16 years, whether on the school committee, city council, we've been directly involved when we talked about the previous fire trucks or different, different, uh, you know, uh, expenditures that we put out, whether it was for police cars or a new station or whatnot, but we were involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1347.681s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This council has yet to see updated financials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1350.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're, we're, we're nervous chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1353.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm nervous that we're going to get to me and we're going to come here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1356.005s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm going to say, forget the fire trucks, George.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1358.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We might have to cut firemen or firewomen, and I don't want that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1362.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1363.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to get together with the chief, with the mayor's office, and really start, because they've gone publicly to different arenas, and they publicly mentioned how awful the budget's gonna be this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1375.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And listen, I'm publicly saying this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1377.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've said it a thousand times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1379.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sounding redundant to everybody, and I sound like a crybaby at times, but I'm frightened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1384.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm nervous, because I don't know what we're doing here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1387.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This council hasn't talked to anybody about what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1390.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1392.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for the update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1393.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My recommendation is that we make motion that we call for an emergency meeting with the mayor's office to get an update on the capital plan dealing specifically with ordering the fire trucks within this 30-day window so the clock can start now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1407.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Does 2020 code that, Chief?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1410.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 2020 trucks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1413.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the possibility is we have to make them last for at least another two and a half years if the clock started today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1418.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's why we need to get the clock started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1420.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to do whatever we need to do as a council to jump ahead of anything needed that this council needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1426.52s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So whatever we can do, that's all I'm asking, Chief, is to get the administration to sit down with us and say, whatever we need, let's get this done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1434.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's understand if we can use our money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1436.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's see if we can, you know, what other funding mechanisms we can use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1441.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to make sure this happens right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1442.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's that's all I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1443.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, I'll give you an example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1446.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sounds pretty dire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1447.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're down a few a few trucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1449.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a we have a motion later on resolution today for another $1.5 million in sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1455.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1456.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't we haven't even know we don't know where the last 1.5 went last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1460.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So before I these are the issues that we don't know about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1463.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why I asked you to come up and I know it's I know and I don't make I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable in any way chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1468.507s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, you're doing an amazing job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1470.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, you have one of the best departments in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1474.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know and I speak firsthand for the way they treated my mom and my dad when they when they were leaving the service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1480.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I can't say enough about them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1482.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1485.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know, we can see the issues, but we haven't heard anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1488.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why having you come up and just shed some light, I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1491.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1492.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1847.719s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1848.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is Mr. Osborne present?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1850.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He is online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1926.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1928.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1930.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think probably my biggest question is that, I know the fire was first brought up, but since then, I was told that there might be some concerns with new hires at DPW, and new hires with the police department, and the lack of truly, lack of true communication with going back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1949.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that you sent us a clarifying email, and I appreciate that, but I have a question on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1956.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It seems that the comment that when open enrollment is closed, there's no way to get anybody on, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1964.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1981.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So just so you know, Mr. Osborne, I did contact a couple of neighboring communities and talked with the benefits managers, and I know that they have different systems set up that it's a 60-day waiting period once they are hired, no matter what month of the year it is, that if they were hired in January and February, they would then be, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2004.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: added on to the insurance for GIC on April 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2007.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's for example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2008.907s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Another example is February to March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2011.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They would then be hired May 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2012.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They would have the GIC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2015.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've talked to a few people in a few HI departments that have also told me that it's not uncommon<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2023.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for a relationship with the members of GIC and I have a call with them tomorrow to just give them a call and say, hey, listen, be a little persistent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2032.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe one benefits person told me that all she really needs to do is call them three times in a day and they'll get somebody on if it's really needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2041.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's that, I'm a little confused with what you sent and then what I've heard from GIC itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2049.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then the other piece is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2052.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: are all the firefighters that were hired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2055.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know back in February that wants insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2059.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have they been given their insurance or are they still waiting for the insurance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2062.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second question is, do there's still issues with the police that had some concerns and some issues and with DPW?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2072.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you can answer that, that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2109.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so that's alarming to me because I think that when I hire a new person in my position, I work with my HR benefits coordinator in the HR.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2122.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As they go on to the onboarding process,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2126.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the, this is part of their process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2129.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are you telling us that when they're going through the onboarding process, when they're hired for the city of Medford, that that's not the job of the HR department to follow through to make sure they're doing that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2139.73s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because you're making it sound that they have to come to you separately and ask for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2204.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm not just putting blame, I know that you seem to be a team of one, Mr. Osborne.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2212.304s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, we're fortunate that we have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2215.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: teams of six to eight that are working where we're onboarding people, at least that's what it sounds like to me, that you're alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2222.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that seems to be an issue in itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2227.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So right now, you know, no firemen, that everybody has, I know that I've gotten some calls from firemen that they still haven't had their insurance applied to their benefits,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2244.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but no one's reached out to you to let you know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2286.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, I know that representatives Buckley and Jones have reached out and mentioned that they would like to come to the meeting and maybe if you can, if there's any way, gentlemen, if you can, just enlighten me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2305.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was told, I was led to believe that there were firemen and women that were hired back in February that have yet to be granted insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2316.165s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or offered other avenues to get their own insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2320.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just want to make sure that if this is a wrong that we fix it, that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2327.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We look at the departments that need to get on board to make sure this happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2332.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that the police reached out as well, and representatives from DPW had some same concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2339.93s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I guess that since they're not specific to this, I'll call for a separate resolution with the police to understand how that's transpired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2349.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, if you could shed some light and your members appreciate just name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2481.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if I can interrupt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2483.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know it's a two month period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2485.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we figured out in February, they didn't have insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2487.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they didn't have that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2490.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's still a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2491.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have they had that meeting since then?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2669.168s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So more importantly, so July, everything was handed in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2672.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2673.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: August, September, he should have been on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2675.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is he on now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2677.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2776.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if I can, Mr. Osborne, if you're still there, I don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2784.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Obviously, is there a way that we can, first of all, correct this by helping these three firefighters get their GIC benefits ASAP?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2797.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I know that talking to, there's an open pipeline when you express these concerns to GIC directly with issues like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2808.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It takes days to get them on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2810.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is there any way, do we have that possible in Medford or no?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2863.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, so, Mr. Osmond, what I'm trying to figure out is if we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2868.051s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we talk with the firefighters that are in question, and they come to your office tomorrow, do we have someone in place that can assist them to make sure that this is corrected and we don't, nothing happens again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2880.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whether it's one side or the other right now, I don't care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2883.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wanna make sure these firefighters have insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2887.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that possible?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2932.695s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my hope is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2934.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My hope is that with the leadership of the fire department, that we can reach out to those three firefighters, that they can go to Mr. Osborne's office tomorrow and see what needs to be done right now so we can get that clock<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2947.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that clock ticking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2948.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you Mr. Osborne and I can I can have I can share some contacts with you with G. I see that there is a possibility when situations like this arise that you can call them and they can't support you within days that I know we've dealt with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2964.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what I find more alarming to me is that we don't have a system<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2970.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in our HR department that this isn't a natural onboarding system where they come in, fill out the paperwork, do the GIC stuff together, and that happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2982.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's more alarming to me than anything because this wouldn't have happened if we didn't have a competent system in place like other communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2989.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't odd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2990.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2991.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is, private entities, as they come in, if you work with a private entity and you walked in and you sat down with the HR directors of that company, that's part of the onboarding system of acquiring healthcare.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3005.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's probably one of the, after the salary, that's probably the most important thing you're looking at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3010.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that that's what I'm more alarmed right now is that we don't have that process in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3016.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I heard what you said, and what's alarming to me is that you're saying<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3021.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: let the people that we're hiring, who, by the way, we're having a very difficult time finding people to work in Medford, that they have to come and search for you so they can get the benefits that they are required to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3035.814s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because every city employee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3038.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is required to the option of GIC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3041.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3041.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to get in between what was said here, what was said there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3048.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I really don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3049.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I want is these three firefighters<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3052.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to get their insurance as quickly as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3055.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if you'd like to, I'll share that tomorrow with the information that I can get to you, that there's contacts at GIC that I've worked with directly that can help with onboarding special situations, like seems to be this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3069.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is, from what I gather, I'm not confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3073.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: From what I was told, Mr. Osborne, is that all three firefighters that are having issues all wanted the GIC and the city's insurance, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3100.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so for today, what I would love to do is get these three firefighters there tomorrow with our benefits officer and our HR director, and let's get the clock started tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3114.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's get them get their insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3115.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And moving forward, we need to figure out what we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3243.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That tells you the city doesn't care about us, but they only care about money, this, it's a little confused because I know that as as a negotiator on when we were as a teacher, and we negotiate we're one of the first, I believe back in the days, we were on the negotiating team when we were<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3260.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: picking the government insurance process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3262.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that we, that's one of the things with the teachers onboarding system that's done right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3269.234s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that that's something this council, I would make an emotion that we ask that we see the onboarding system that's used in practice today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3280.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and our HR department and then review to see how we can correct these issues so we don't have people or families without insurance without knowing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3289.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that'd be important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3292.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd make that as a form of motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3294.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then I'd also make a form of motion that requests that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3300.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that HR director reach out to these three firefighters directly and call for an emergency meeting with them ASAP so we can get that clock started so they're insured through the city as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3314.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I don't, I don't, personally, I don't, it's not hearsay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3320.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've worked with the GIC often.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3324.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is not a year-long process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3326.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is if you go through different benefits departments, they have charts that are set up that shows you if you're hired, and these dates, these are the dates that you'll be on board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3338.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're given, they're,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3340.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not going to share with you, but this is one communities that they share with the person that's hired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3345.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3346.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is your date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3347.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're hired in this date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3348.526s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Expect to have your G. I. C. On this date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3351.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's something we need to correct on the city side to make sure this doesn't happen again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3355.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, again, this is this is alarming, but I think it's something we need to correct as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3525.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3526.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3528.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can just just final question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3530.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3533.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have those motions in place, but if Mr. Osborne can answer, are we having similar issues with fire and DPW as well, and other departments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3545.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Police, excuse me, police and DPW, any other departments that, so we can correct that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5255.065s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5257.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I, too, expressed concern early in the whole meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5265.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with no outlook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5268.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or vision of our finances, I find it very difficult to support any paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5273.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know I appreciate all the work that Tim you're doing and your other department heads, but I hope you can understand that as a city councilor that doesn't know the financial climate of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5288.922s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then being given a paper $1.5 million to bond to me is very, very,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5298.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: unacceptable, to say the least.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5301.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that the other piece that I found alarming is that when we're looking at sidewalk repairs, we've also asked for an update to what the last 1.5 million that I balked at, if we all recall, that we all approved that because we needed it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5319.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to be honest with you, I don't see much work going on on sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5326.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and we've asked for a report of an update and we haven't gotten that either unless I missed that but I haven't gotten an update with that so I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5336.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would move to table this until both Councilor Knight's feedback is responded, his motion responded, and we get the update on where that money went for the last one and a half million dollars that we bonded for sidewalk repair, replacement, and stump removal, because I'm still getting a lot of phone calls that sidewalks are a mess, and I haven't seen that list that we've asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5366.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, I apologize, but that's how I feel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5696.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5698.868s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Tim, I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5702.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As one councilor, I stood here in my first budget and asked for a sidewalk hot top crew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5710.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We worked with the neighboring DPW commissioner that put everything into place, a whole funding mechanism, which isn't a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5718.507s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the most important thing they said was before we get that equipment, make sure you have enough people that are going to run that equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5725.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5726.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we're putting the cart in front of the horse because I think you're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5730.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need our crew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5731.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need this equipment, but we need the crew to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5775.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5775.761s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a capital plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5776.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I submitted a request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5778.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know the mayor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5779.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5780.186s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the whole idea is that truck and the equipment needed with three staff members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5785.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It wasn't a lot of money considering what we've been putting in for bonds over the last four or five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5790.698s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It really pays for itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5791.839s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I applaud your effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6104.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know the Councilor Knight has a motion, I believe, that I seconded, but I just wanted to make sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6112.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Tim, it's nothing against you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6113.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the hard work you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6115.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I think that to my fellow colleagues that we look at the lack of financial transparency and not understanding who we are right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6127.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think to vote for any money paper right now would be a huge detriment as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6139.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm only going to bring this up a thousand times tonight because I think it's important that we're going to get to May and I don't want to say I told you so because the fact that we don't know where we are financially and it's premature to be bringing money papers to this council and asking for things that might end up having a bond for new equipment but the possibility of hiring<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6167.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: isn't even on the radar, looking at possible cuts is what I'm afraid of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6173.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what, until we get a clear fiscal vision of where we're going and the understanding, I think it would be really, it would be really reckless for this council to be voting for money papers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6194.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, between the lack of legal support that we have, you know, and I think earlier I was so upset because I just keep reading this KP law stuff and all I keep talking to different city solicitors and understanding that every time that phone rings and they pick it up, it's $700 and the clock starts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6213.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with $700 and we don't know where we are financially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6217.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I'm going to share this a thousand times and I'm going to sound like a broken record, but I'm going to tell you, I think it's irresponsible for us to vote for money papers until we have the proper legal support and knowledge of our fiscal outlook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6234.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6987.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, madam president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6995.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6996.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate Mr. Lieberman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6998.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's been very active and involved in our community, and he makes a lot of sense at times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7004.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think when we're talking about money papers, I think for one, Councilor, KP law is an issue because we've made mistakes because we don't have legal representation supporting this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7015.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we've been left out in the cold on some serious legal issues that cost us a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7022.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7024.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My respect for Tim and what they're doing, it can't be, it's not questioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7033.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He is amazing, what they're doing there is amazing, but the problem we're having is understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7039.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we had our financial paperwork here the other day, financial director here, and he presented some sort of paperwork.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7046.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We still don't see where we are financially in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7051.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So bonding and keep spending money, not understanding where we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7055.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It sounds great today and I think it's out of the box and let's do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7058.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7059.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7060.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we come to me and say, guess what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7064.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't know the financial outlook, but this is what it is today now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7068.311s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We now have to go to Tim and say, Tim, you have that great equipment we just purchased, but now they're gonna turn into planters, because now we have to lay off 10 DPW employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7078.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is my fear of where we were last year, last May and June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7083.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Don't forget where we were, that at one in the morning, the mayor had to come back from home and try to figure out a way to give us, find us $12 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7092.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's all I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7095.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know the issues we have in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7097.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We see it every day and we appreciate directors like Tim that are working their tail off and trying to do the best they can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7105.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But for one council that represents everybody in the city of Medford financially, if we don't see the paperwork in front of us, we don't see the numbers in front of us, no matter what was presented last week, because that's a great start, but it's March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7122.236s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7124.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7690.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, Madam President, again, I don't,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7693.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, it's not that I don't support, uh, traffic, uh, engineer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7701.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that he does an amazing job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7703.18s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I think that there's too many questions still haven't been asked or answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7708.544s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, when we've sent that out, I reiterate what Councilor Knight said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7713.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our city solicitor said that there were some concerns with the process and agreed with this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7722.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then, again, we get contradictory feedback from KP Law, so I'm left in limbo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7729.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think that we can move forward with any of these caps or increases or change of salaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7737.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Although, do I think it deserves it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7739.186s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Absolutely, but it's also, what we're seeing is you have other departments that people are picking up duties<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7751.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and not being compensated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7753.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll give you an example of the veteran director who was put into position back in the day when he was the hearing officer and he was waiting to be compensated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7765.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And don't forget that day because people that were here remember the injustice there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7771.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So here we are now in the same situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7774.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this isn't how business works in the municipality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7778.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Although as much as I like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7781.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7781.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't you can't be picking and choosing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7784.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's a slippery slope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7785.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, this is why, you know, not having having a conflicting legal, um, representation is a huge problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7796.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I won't be able to support this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7799.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8155.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8158.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8159.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just just to be clear, I appreciate these comments and I think that that's what's great about this forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8166.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, this is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8169.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as 23-057 then leads off to 23-058 and that's gonna talk about the differential in the salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8180.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want us all to look at that and realize that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8184.076s">[Scarpelli]</a>: does, because it seems to me that we're going to be losing a union position and all of us here are union supporters, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8191.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This compensation for what reads in the next resolution, the increase of the funding using salaries would be funded because of a highway salaries account due to temporary vacancies in the senior clerk position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8205.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So does that mean that we're losing the senior clerk position to fund this position?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8210.792s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8211.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8213.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what does that mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8214.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just for clarification purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8216.92s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when this person does come back, Tim, we're gonna hire this person back full salary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8221.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then how are we gonna pay this position if that money's being used somewhere else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8234.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Chief of staff Nazarian here, just because that's something that's important before I vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8238.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you look for both papers together, this is approving something that is still questionable because of not understanding the true legal separation of two different parties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8248.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But then the next page talks about the funding of that position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8252.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's looks like eliminating a union position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8255.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So is Chief of Staff here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8260.316s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She did say she was, though, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8297.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, just...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8299.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the increase the funding using the salaries of funded curve, the DPW salaries account due to a temporary vacancy and the senior clerk's position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8308.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That person is now, they hired the person now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8311.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was a vacancies back?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8312.953s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8313.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8342.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just clarify that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8345.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to lose that clerical position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8510.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8513.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8664.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Madam President, the Furniture Trust Company is an amazing organization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8672.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They are an organization that goes in, especially during the pandemic, and go into these multi-billion dollar office buildings that haven't even opened, that were built prior to the pandemic, and have furniture that is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8689.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: brand new and untouched.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8691.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they're brought in to throw away all this brand new equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8696.18s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what they've done is gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8697.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They reach out to all nonprofits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8701.544s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will tell you in recreation, they've refurbished our teen center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8707.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've worked with our administrative staff in the school department and multiple other locations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8712.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that prior to the pandemic,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8717.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Zarian, I know that all that furniture that was in here, the movie company, all that was donated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8725.486s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate the hard work that the Furniture Trust Company does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8729.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a former Method resident, Pat Redden, who spearheads that endeavor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8734.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he just called me today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8738.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's helping homeless family and making sure that they're donating furniture for homeless families and different homeless organizations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8750.368s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Framingham State closed the whole dorm and they took all of the furniture<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8757.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: bureaus and betting and moved it over to a homeless center in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8762.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they do so many great things and I appreciate, I know this is a hard, difficult thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8768.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It took a little while to get this signed off, but we appreciate everything you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8772.115s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Villes for pointing that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8773.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want to make sure they get their credit too, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=32.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=614.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=615.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=616.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's what my sentiments were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=618.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that the biggest concern we had when this came in front of this body is that, especially at the time during the pandemic, we were seeing the effects, the negative effects with what was happening in our country affecting our brick and mortar businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=636.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as we continue to work out of the pandemic, and here we are, we're finally safe, hopefully,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=645.01s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're seeing businesses thriving, especially in the square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=648.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the number one goal is not to allow<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=654.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the food trucks other than what we stipulated in the guidelines that Council Bears expressed that it was for special events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=664.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, but the concern was that there are special events that come up and sometimes the council won't meet and it leaves organizations in limbo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=674.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's giving the right to city administration<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=678.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and the Board of Health to give that permission and take it off the City Council plate for those purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=687.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't want anybody to miss out on an opportunity, but at the same time, my number one goal from the beginning was protecting our brick and mortar businesses, especially in the climate that we're in right now here in Medford, where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=703.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we have, we need to keep and what we need to grow on the brick and mortar businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=710.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we're bringing in food trucks from outside the city and allowing these organizations to roll up, we're going to really taint what we're looking for, and especially most of our squares and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=729.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and bringing more solid businesses to the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=734.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I agree with Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=736.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we agreed on a good plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=740.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for their purposes of making sure that no one is left behind, but at the same time, still protecting the brick and mortar businesses and not allowing the full-time or a specialized area that some communities do have that maybe their businesses thrive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=756.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Until I see our brick and mortar businesses thriving and people rushing to come to Medford and opening restaurants, I would hate to give a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=766.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a food truck provision to come and go as they may please and take business away from what we need to grow in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=774.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=942.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, I know other communities use, I can understand that too, but so leaving the permitting process with the health department to make sure that we follow those guidelines, but taking it away from the council to make sure that it's a more streamlined process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=960.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know other,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=962.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: communities use the communications department that does all the special events for the city, or even the parks and recreations director, and allowing that purview under the guidelines that we've given them, that's pretty simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=981.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that if the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=984.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Board of Health doesn't want to do that because it's out of their purview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=986.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=988.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we have other departments in the city that perform permitting processes that, given the guidelines of our ordinance, I think this shouldn't be a heavy lift.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=999.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have multiple departments here that we can delegate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1005.427s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the permanent process to if that's the only issue, I don't see why we can't just put that on the city administration to appoint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1015.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the best practice that they follow, because they run road races, they run special events, they do parades, they do walks around City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1024.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't perform those permits, someone that does that in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1028.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would recommend, Madam President, that this question be given to the administration to pinpoint the department and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1040.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: allow that department to follow through with the permitting process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1044.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1045.477s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1152.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let me finish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1155.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can this, we're making this very difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1158.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's one day special permits for special events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1161.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1163.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not special events four days in a row, unless<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1166.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the city that allows a permit if they had, let's say per se, a carnival in the city that lasted two or three days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1173.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're just protecting the long-term permitting process of a food truck anywhere in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1183.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've already decided we're against that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1185.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're protecting our brick and mortar businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1187.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know, this isn't a heavy lift.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1190.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To me, it's very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1192.088s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The permitting process goes to the administration to assign someone to do that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1196.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Health department assigns that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1198.93s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it's something that we didn't put in the ordinance that says that it has to be in a private, in a public way, then we can adjust that, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1208.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Other than that, I think it's that simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1211.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We do not want food trucks in a designated area anywhere, at least for now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1217.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: at least this council does, I'm speaking for myself, but until we have security and growth in our business community, allowing food trucks is only gonna hurt that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1231.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's my philosophy, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1992.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1995.805s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just as a resolution, I think, can we, I'll be asking this moving forward, that can we also have a report of the billable hours from KP Law to address situations like this to the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2012.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm going to be asking that moving forward until we have a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2021.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This this is a type of ordinance that is done within days in the in city halls all over this Commonwealth with the city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2031.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2033.764s">[Scarpelli]</a>: nothing personal, I just need to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2036.247s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Moving on, this is gonna be a common cry from Councilor Scarpelli till we see a city solicitor, that we get a report back of how many billable hours it'll take KP Law to address these concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2049.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2072.115s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, here's what I've got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2074.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, the council, the health director, the interim economic development director, any departments, the administration, if necessary, come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2556.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Vice President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2589.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=218.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, Madam President, I think that when the students did come up, you could see the excitement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=223.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'm proud of is really we sent a challenge out there and how everybody rallied financially to support<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=232.429s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this group so they can go and represent Netrid at that championship level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=236.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that, you know, they deserve all the credit they received from us, but it's glad to see that this community really supports our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=247.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=299.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, I can approach the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=321.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=324.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see a few friends here tonight and I'm glad they can make it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=331.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it was a few weeks ago, we had a very scary and horrific situation and dangerous situation occur over at the Tufts pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=342.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And something that would have really put our community, I think, in a real tailspin, and it would have affected so many lives in a negative manner, especially the young person that was drowning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=357.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I heard this situation, I was fortunate that my daughter is a lifeguard and she's trained by the best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=365.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I always thought, as the assistant recreation director, I have 40 lifeguards, I have two pools, and wanted to make sure that our staff is trained the correct way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=379.191s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's funny, because when I called Kevin and I said, Kevin, I'm going to put this up, he says, don't put our names on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=385.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not about us, it's about the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=387.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it wouldn't be fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=390.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if we didn't acknowledge yourself, Kevin, and Danny, folks, for your leadership in what you do for our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=399.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People don't know, I asked Kevin to come over and train my lifeguards in Somerville a few weeks ago, and I appreciate he did that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=406.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there's a reason for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=408.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's the best in the state at what he does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=411.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And for what happened that day,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=415.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, I had a great conversation with my friend Osman and said, you know, what happened and how graphic the whole situation was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=424.293s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you hear a kid drown, a kid who's drowning, what do you think?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=428.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's like, oh, he was flailing his, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=431.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To hear the whole description of,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=434.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, getting the call and the lifeguards all running into action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=437.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, and Osmond seeing the young person at the bottom of the pool and how, how was it called?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=442.331s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was, uh, he was pinned, I guess, face first on the, on the floor of the pool and everybody went into action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=450.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=451.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's something that needs to be told, and it needs to be elevated, and our lifeguards and our staff need to be congratulated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=461.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know the whole story, it's phenomenal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=464.821s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The buzz went around within 15 minutes around Medford, how Osmond went right in the water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=470.29s">[Scarpelli]</a>: did exactly what he was trained to do, bring him to the top, turn, the backboard was on site, staff was there, they took the person, the young person on the deck, everybody's in action, everybody, I know that the pool manager right away knew her role, the fire department was called, and in typical fashion, Osmond said to me, he says, no, Mr. Scapelli says, the firemen were amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=495.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's what the whole team, they all knew what to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=497.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because when I talked to the fire department, they said, no, no, it's a young person who jumped in and brought, all we had to do was get there and then do what we're trained for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=506.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's save a life on the deck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=508.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So between Armstrong ambulance and the fire department and Kevin's training,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=516.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I really wanted to do tonight is just acknowledge you as quickly as we can, because I know a lot of you young people off to college and we won't see you for a few months, but we contacted the clerk and he put together a citation for you that, you know, this is probably, I've given out a thousand citations, champions in sports, academic awards, music awards, right, drama club,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=545.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this is the most amazing citation that we're giving out tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=550.423s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm so I'm so happy for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=552.805s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because what you people did, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=556.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know chief chief just walked in, I said, I know, you know, give him kudos and his staff for what the fire department chief<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=564.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know you don't like the accolades and that's your job, but the fact that the firefighters and the lifeguards work together to save a life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=574.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so what we did is we put a citation together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=578.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It reads, the Medford City Council takes great pleasure in presenting this council accommodation to, this is our manager at the pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=589.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: From what I'm told, she's like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=590.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's like the den mother, and she's taking care of everything at the pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=594.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's Danielle DelBene.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=596.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And for your quick and heroic response and saving the life of a drowning youth at Tufts Pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=602.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you can come on up and take a citation, Danielle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=616.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then if you can, everybody knows how Zach likes to be taking pictures with everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=620.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're just going to take a big picture with everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=626.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=630.148s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You don't like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=631.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=634.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Next, we have Sophia Purifuri.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=654.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have Ellis Vasquez.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=675.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Coleman Jones, is Coleman here tonight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=678.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=683.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Arias Bravo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=708.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it Aja Bravo, oh, how is that I Tell you what, this is this is Kevin again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=735.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Osmond McCormack.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=753.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can, if everybody come right up front, I'd like to take a picture so we could send this off to the newspapers and make sure that everybody realizes what you did and how special people that you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=765.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So come on up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=993.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thanks, Chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1227.261s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1228.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I, you know, to that point, I know that I see it firsthand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1232.186s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when it's pouring outside, and Gianna asked my wife to get eight beach towels, because they have training and we said it's pouring, and it's 52 degrees out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1243.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we said, What is Kevin thinking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1245.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1245.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I take that all back, have whatever I was going to publicly tell you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1251.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is the reason why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1252.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And Janet, just like probably the rest of the lifeguards, they go gladly because situations like this because and people don't realize it's just not a it's just not a clean, safe pool all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1262.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1263.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: all of our lifeguards also train with your staff and yourself at the pond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1267.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's a difficult, especially with bad weather.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1270.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, and it's two different types of positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1275.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these kids really commit themselves and your staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1278.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, we appreciate what you guys have done and you made us look really, really good in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1284.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know there's one family that's very, very happy today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1286.582s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1287.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1946.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, just for clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1947.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This was just for at the time was for over 300 units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1950.911s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It wasn't mixed use correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1952.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My refresh my memory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1976.041s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate that you're here, because I think this is the question that I had back then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1980.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, especially with that area and getting a lot of feedback on what's happening there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1985.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what the T's interpretation of what their wishes are, and the rumors that what they want to do with that space and the airspace of that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=1996.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's a lot of variables that are in place there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2000.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: miss out they said so I'm, I'm just a little concerned that what question I had back then was, what is our vision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2005.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, if you can share something with us because when you look at neighboring communities, and you know look at Linfield look at assembly row, look at station landing when that was done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2015.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was done with a comprehensive plan of what that whole area was going to look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2021.297s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In essence, we're looking at one piece of what else and I think that's what, you know, people are asking for and personally myself as a gateway entrance to our community exit to our community, you know what, what do we see there what we envision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2358.779s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so I appreciate the answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2360.92s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the biggest concern that I'm hearing from the neighbors<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2363.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And personally, I think that, you know, I was fortunate being a member of a municipality that was actually directly involved as we talked about with this new zoning consultant coming in plus the team that will be going out to each neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2378.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's important to get, you know, as recreation, I was in all meetings as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2383.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have to go represent recreation at the different neighborhood meetings to talk about the vision of that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2390.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that it's nice that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2392.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You, you explained it perfectly and I completely understand, but if we keep doing the spot zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2399.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's really not a big comprehensive, you know, master plan that everybody wants to share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2405.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that you get the word out as best you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2410.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: neighbors from that area, when you're talking about that area, they really, when we talk about this project after we voted the last time and they said 300 some odd units, what are we going to do with that neighborhood?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2419.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was nothing to calm them to understand what, you know, you're talking about Rivers Edge, you're talking about what's happening down the street in Everett, and now we're adding 300 more units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2431.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think having the community input, that's why I implore the city, the administration, to really, and I can make this form of motion, to give us an update where we are with the hiring of our consultants as well as partners so we can work together to get this done because, like you said, waiting a year and a half<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2452.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're not gonna wait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2453.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But imagine what we've already lost because we don't have a comprehensive plan, because we don't have the tools in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2459.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can get that going, if we can put that out, we'd appreciate it, Mr. Clerk, Madam President, and thank you for your answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2475.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just to share, I appreciate that, but again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2478.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when it's affecting neighbor direct neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2481.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand we post and we do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2483.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2484.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But you know, as well as I do, unless people are directly impacted, and they know what's going on, that they really don't know what's going until all of a sudden shovels in the ground, like no one told us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2493.65s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's not true, but it's what's then promoted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2499.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just wanna make sure that it's mentioned, it's not your fault, I know you do what you're supposed to do, but I think having this piece in place, and as we talked about, putting that piece with the zoning and having the team that's gonna go out to the neighborhoods and really get what everybody's input, I think that's what a true partnership is with the community and our zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2519.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2521.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3582.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that looking at the map, it looks like really the only public interruption is going to be on College Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3589.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I see that everything's been signed off and everything's approved by the engineer and the city electrical department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3596.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't see anything that will prohibit this council from voting, so I'll move to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3935.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3940.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I received many phone calls about a recreational vehicle that was parked at Medford High School for some days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3947.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I quickly called the superintendent and we had a great discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3952.763s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the understanding was that the word was that it was the registration came back to a school team member and the questions and the concerns of the neighbors saying that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3966.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, there was special treatment, that this isn't right, this is a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3972.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So instead of...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3975.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: continue with the back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3979.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I contacted the superintendent and what she said in her response, she sent this today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3984.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll read it if I can, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3987.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just for clarification, the superintendent did say that I am providing the following information in response to the listing of a motion on tonight's city council agenda offered by city council, George Scappelli, regarding the use of parking facilities in the grounds of Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4002.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The owner of the recreational vehicle currently parked in Method High School received permission after making a request to the high school principal who has full and appropriate authority over the use of school grounds, including parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4015.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The vehicle is set to be moved from the school grounds on or about July 14th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4020.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In the past,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4022.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With the explicit permission of the school department and buildings principal, school parking has been made available for use by individual Medford residents, other city departments, including the Department of Public Works and Public Safety Department, public and private contractors for temporary parking of construction machinery and other entities and organizations, including film crews working in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4046.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In each case,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4048.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the school parking space will not in any way impede or interfere with student employee or public access to school facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4061.159s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please feel free to contact me additional information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4064.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is exactly what the superintendent did say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4067.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, um, that's all it just clarification that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4072.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If this is the case, then it's given permission, then I think that's a new point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4078.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just wanted to make sure that I shared that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4081.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People have their own opinions one way or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4085.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, if residents are seeking permission to park a vehicle at the high school, there is an avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4091.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why I was asking for policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4093.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that that's probably the biggest<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4100.518s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I get out of this conversation and this resolution is if we can, just if this is common practice, which I don't disagree, we've seen commercial vehicles, we've seen other vehicles parked there, that the policy be made public because if this is an option, because we do have residents that from time to time have a very difficult time parking their boats or recreational vehicles or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4126.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, and sometimes during, you know, during for months now, this isn't again, this isn't all summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4131.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, as long as the policies, it's written, it's it's in, it's transparent, and I have no problem with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4140.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4228.745s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, if I can, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4231.907s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I was a strong, I was against the budget and anything dealing with funding for the city, especially after our hearing a month ago and the discussions of understanding that the numbers that were in the budget that were given to us weren't correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4252.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And until I see otherwise, I know Councilor Caraviello did his due diligence by reaching out to the company that provided those numbers to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4263.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They were very clear that the numbers that the financial director mentioned that this company was fraudulent in putting the numbers out, they were wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4275.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think Councilor Caraviello can speak to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4278.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They told us that those are the exact numbers that the city of Medford gave to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4283.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I will not support any money paper dealing with this year's budget because we still have many questions and many concerns of where this funding is coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4296.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5611.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5612.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President, for allowing me to speak on this because I did talk to the superintendent and I want to read.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5617.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that one of the one of the students, Stevie Rayner, he's who contacted me directly, wanted me to say say hi to him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5625.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he said, you know, and answer these the concerns that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5630.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, it's funny when things go out, and the discussion was that they're opening all the coaching positions for Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5638.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know this isn't a privy of the city council, but this is a forum that, unfortunately, as quickly as the word can get out, because this is an important topic, I talked to the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5652.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The word was on the street, and the superintendent and I discussed it in depth, that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5659.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We are now putting in a policy in the middle of the summer that will now open up all the coaching positions and the athletic director, the big question was the athletic directors were not involved in the hiring, that the process is skewed and this is, you know, witch hunts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5681.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: talk to the superintendent, the superintendent reassured me that the athletic directors are in full involvement with this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5691.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They will be on top of the situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5694.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that and I shared my own personal opinion as a 32 year coach and athletic director and understanding the process that I shared my concerns that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5705.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's where we've got some phone calls that during the fall season, the fall season starts in a few weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5710.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the process is in place right now to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5714.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: have a committee put together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5716.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the rumor was that it was gonna be just parents and kids hiring coaches, not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5723.821s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The superintendent and I shared what we do in neighbor community where I'm part of that as a former coach, I'm also involved in the hiring team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5734.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's between six to eight individuals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5737.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not two or three people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5738.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not people that are on there that don't like a coach that's sitting in the position right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5744.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a position where we have the athletic directors, the assistant assistant athletic director, the the athletic trainer, you have two sitting seniors or captains that are coming back that season, and alumni that played that sport.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5760.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You also have a parent and you have either a teacher in the school or a coach that's in the system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5768.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so it's a whole, it's a whole committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5770.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a true committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5772.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that, um, you know, that's, that's what we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5775.917s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's, it's very important that every school in the greater Boston league does that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5780.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I talked to, uh, athletic director Maloney, he met with the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5784.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They had a great discussion when I was told that the process is exactly what, what I just said, that that's the hope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5792.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, let's, let's, you know, not jump ahead of it, not,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5798.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it, you know, because kids are nervous, and I expressed the superintendent in this way, because of the fall season is what I'm a little concerned about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5808.423s">[Scarpelli]</a>: By the time the committee's put together, by the time the interviews are done, you're looking probably the middle of August, the season starts the third week of August.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5819.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Using football, for example, if the football coach is let go and a new coach comes in, you are giving the student athletes that have been involved with this coach the last three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5832.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is every sport, girls' soccer, boys' soccer, golf, volleyball.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5836.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: coaches that involved last two months with the student athletes working camps, giving back to the community, kids getting in shape.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5843.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The other piece that was was brought forth is you have coaches from colleges that are talking to student athletes, and they're discussing the possibility of being recruited and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5854.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to make a coaching change this quick might be detrimental for their future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5858.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the superintendent understood, we agreed to disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5862.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that, you know, I think the process in place is a fair and open process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5867.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's just like, like she said, it's an anomaly, because you have to start somehow, you have to start sometime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5873.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my wish was starting for the winter season, if this is a process we move to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5878.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I think the answer is very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5882.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5884.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The athletic director is involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5886.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a true committee, from what I was told by the superintendent, of a varied amount of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5891.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not just two people, a parent that doesn't like a coach, or a kid that doesn't like a coach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5895.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate letting me discuss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5899.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think publicly it needed to be said, because I don't think there's a forum, as we get closer to the season, that I think the kids wanted me to give an answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5908.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Their parents had reached out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5911.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate it, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=673.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=673.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Dasch, I know that one of the questions that was brought forth was the turnaround for the fire truck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=678.293s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was a big issue, but that was resolved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=680.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=681.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I think the biggest issue is really moving this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=684.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something that I believe what the family had mentioned at the beginning, that it was a hardship due to a family member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=691.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's the reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=692.477s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=695.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know my fellow counsel is going to table it, so he allowed me to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=700.29s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would move it on the vote, but obviously I don't think it will have the vote, so I just think that we have a new council coming in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=710.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that if we can bring them up to speed and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=715.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: hope for the first meeting in January we get this passed, because this is, I still don't, I don't see why it's an issue that we can't move this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=723.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because it seems like in good faith, we're, we're, we're going above and beyond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=727.575s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, I look at this in a sense that we're kind of holding the Alps hostage here, in a sense that we're, you know, what we're asking them to do, we're going above and beyond right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=738.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it seems like the city has really, really just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=743.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: waste a lot of people's time not getting the answers to the right people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=747.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To hear the fact the mayor hasn't even seen this yet is a little bothersome to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=751.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That to me is just, you know, no disrespect in any way, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=756.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: attorneys are expensive, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=758.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And everybody has to make a living.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=761.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we're talking about amount of time that's being spent by the Alice family to try to get this push forward for a good reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=767.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And in even having the open dialogue and doing something that I know I wouldn't do, I wouldn't, you know, allow myself to sort of be bullied to try to make this happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=779.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This should be something our community should be looking to assist each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=783.071s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=785.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: know, I just I'm a little confused why we can't move this forward in the sense of a time sensitive situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=791.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but I'll leave it at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=794.19s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1614.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1615.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If Council Vice President would entertain, could we add something to the motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1624.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to get the attendance record for all of the members on the Election Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1629.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1630.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I think that's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1632.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, from what I gather, we don't have too many members that are actually committed to that commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1638.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't think we're taking it as serious as we should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1641.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My biggest piece with this situation is accountability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1645.268s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've seen very, very good people be marched out that door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1649.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But not even a quarter of the concerns that we've we've<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1658.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or understand any process that has gone on is a disgrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1665.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I haven't heard from one commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1667.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I haven't heard from anybody except for the coordinator who sent us a message saying that the election is now certified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1679.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And like Councilor Caraviello said, my biggest problem is when I was a young man, when I was in high school, everybody had a mandatory class called civics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1693.313s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you learned about our government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1694.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You learned about the respect you should give this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1702.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I still remember my son just left a minute ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1704.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about how Mrs. Lasky ran the fourth grade presidential election in her classroom and how important everything was and how organized everything should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1716.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wish Mrs. Lasky ran this last election because Councilor Caraviello again is right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1722.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When people don't want to vote,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1724.636s">[Scarpelli]</a>: good people, good hardworking people that took pride in coming to that ballot box every municipal election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1733.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've looked me in the eye and said, they'll never vote again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1736.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They have no faith.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1738.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I truly thought that maybe coming out ahead of this could have helped that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1744.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But instead, we just fed into the rhetoric.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1747.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said it the day that we had the first issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1749.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said, what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1750.868s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said, be careful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1752.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because perception is reality and it's exactly what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1759.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So moving forward, I know that we'll have a new council, but I think as this council looks to move people forward and look at our budgetary processes, we have to start looking for people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1773.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If the city administration is not going to hold people accountable, then we're going to have to make sure that they<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1778.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that they know that this council is going to be strong enough to make sure they hold their people to the feet of the fire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1784.827s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because this has been an absolute laughingstock across the commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1790.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the fact, I'll be honest with you, I'm disgusted with the Secretary of State's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1797.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Reached out to them, haven't heard anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1802.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what they're all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1804.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If this is what the Secretary of State and our governor sees that that's appropriate, look what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1812.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a trickle-down effect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1813.91s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, who knows how many people aren't going to come out for the next elections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1819.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1820.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one's told us anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1821.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one's even talked to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1823.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I got a bunch of fluffy, I'm getting a lot of emails, fluffy emails, you know, wishing me luck, a happy birthday, a congratulations, but no one is still from that commission's talked to me about, George, this is what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1838.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they're good people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1842.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then for the recount, I know I wasn't there, but I,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1847.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I talked to a few people that came here, gave their time to help with the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1853.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I heard our coordinator, our elections coordinator was verbally getting in people's faces and disrespecting people to the point where the attorney from the from the candidate side had to step in and say, Please do not address any of our people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1872.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Talk to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1874.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a disgrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1878.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's a lot more that's going to go on in that meeting when they come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1882.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But my biggest thing right now is, and a lot of people that have talked to him on every side, every side, this isn't just, you know, the George Scarpelli side, this is every side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1893.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody's watching to see where the accountability pieces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1898.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what everybody's waiting to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1901.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if you want to give them benefit of the doubt until the January 29.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1904.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1907.705s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if you're gonna come up to that podium on January 29th and give us fluff, be prepared, because this one Councilor is gonna ask some serious questions, and I'm gonna be calling people out directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1922.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President, and I rest my case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2615.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It says, temporary shelter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2616.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hello, representatives, senators, members of Medford City Council, Medford School Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2620.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wanted to give you all a heads up on an ever-evolving matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2624.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At the end of last week, I was informed that 400 Riverside Ave was being explored.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2629.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as a possible temporary winter emergency shelter for migrant families on the wait list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2634.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The state was only going to pick one site from my recollection on a phone call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2640.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The families would only each stay a few nights before they would be transitioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2645.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The shelter was going to run through April and start with those families currently staying at 10 Park Plaza and may build up to no more than 75 families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2656.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The state, excuse me, 75, the state asked for a walkthrough today, and at the time, the Commissioner Rice relayed different terms to us, all regarding capacity and length of stay through June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2669.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He also said that this was the site they plan to try to move forward with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2674.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have another call with the state tomorrow to try to get more clarity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2679.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is 110,000 square foot site that meets the needs of the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2684.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm worried about the burden it will cause with city staff, the school department, and et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2690.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It reaches the capacity that we are unable to handle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2694.429s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will follow up with you when we have more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2697.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was on 12-5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2699.794s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is, I thought this was public record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2702.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't realize that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2703.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't know that no one else knew it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2705.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the first time that I heard that no one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2706.78s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, I'm sorry, I don't have Facebook, but yeah, this isn't Facebook, but I would assume diagonally across.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2711.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I would assume we should have a.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2714.486s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We should call for a community meeting immediately, maybe somewhere in that area that we can let our neighbors know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2721.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because from what I gather, it doesn't sound like the mayor's supporting this either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2726.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if this is something on the state level, I think it's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2730.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the biggest thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2732.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I heard this, I talked to a couple of teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2736.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they were confused because they<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2739.747s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the increase in numbers in the elementary school, especially kindergarten level, I guess they've added an extra kindergarten to every single school already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2747.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there was some thought that we've already let families in, and that's the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2753.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if that isn't the issue,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2754.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the fear from our educators that any influx, now remember, anybody that moves into our community as a child, they have every right to go to school in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2766.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is gonna put a huge burden, a burden that I don't think that can meet the capacity<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2771.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we offer right now, both at the McGlynn and the Roberts for sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2775.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know if the other schools have space from what I was told that there aren't many places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2781.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, the other issue we heard was with the closure of the Salem Street Fire Station back in our area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2789.183s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I say our area because we grew up in North Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2791.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The idea of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2793.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: any more an influx of this magnitude with only one true station that's on that side, really, other than coming from the main station and then the heights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2804.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's really going to play an impact with public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2807.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's a lot of issues here that I appreciate you bringing this forward today because I think that it's scary at many different levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2815.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, like I said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2818.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when I gather the mayor is really confused with this whole situation as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2822.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So not to support her in any way and understanding it, but this is something that one thing we should do is have community meeting or something should go out saying what she just said in this email that I personally thought because this is a public record, I thought it was already out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2840.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I didn't know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2841.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2842.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wish I knew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2911.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is why it's an issue, because I took that as that they changed that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2918.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The original phone call was for temporary, and then it was extended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2922.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm looking at it totally different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2924.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's why, I think having some clarity, I think that's why really just having some clarity from the main office I think would be important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3285.548s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3287.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's difficult for me because when you spend so much time in people, it's not just every other Tuesday now, or it was every Tuesday, but my first two phone calls on the way to work every morning was to Councilor Caraviello, then to Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3310.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I want to applaud you, Rick, is for teaching all of us to understand why we do what we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3319.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think people have forgotten that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3321.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think last meeting was a pretty good indication of where we were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3327.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Rick Caraviello, the Rick Caraviello I know, no one understands how much you've done for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3337.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What's great about a person that does things, hey, listen, it's great when the camera's in your face, people taking pictures of people talking about you, and you're standing up and shaking hands and cutting ribbon, because I know a lot of people that do that and love it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3349.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's all ego-driven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3351.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the Rick Caraviello I know, that I'm honored to call my friend, has always done things behind the scenes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3358.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I've always admired that about you, Rick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3361.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've tried to emulate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3363.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's very difficult to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3366.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: while running a family and running a business and taking care of dad that's in a home and understanding everything that goes on in a person's life, you still have time to feed the hungry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3383.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You still have time to build a deck for a person that can't afford a handicap ramp.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3391.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When a veteran needs something, it's Rick Caraviello they call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3397.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I used to be, to be honest, I was so jealous of how you did that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3402.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, but it also made me proud that I've learned from the best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3408.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've sat behind this rail with some amazing people, some amazing people that when I sit and talk about all these different people than our lifetimes that have lost, we've lost, and they've moved on to the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3422.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the big Mustang land in the sky, I look at it and I say, who's going to take that place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3429.768s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I was fortunate because I see people like Councilor Marks and Councilor Falco and Councilor Knight and you being the Mount Rushmore of that group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3451.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to get emotional because I think that this is more than just you've given enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3456.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Zach is right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3458.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When it came, when you saw the city falling, no one else had the guts to stand up and you stood up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3466.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You stood up taller than any man I've ever seen in my life other than my dad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3474.045s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You didn't hide from anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3475.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You fought every single day to make things right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3482.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm honored to be your friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3484.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I hope I can make those phone calls in the morning still.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3490.233s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And sometimes I think Dina gets jealous because I don't pick up her call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3495.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'd say, I'm on the phone with Carvey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3499.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But she knows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3500.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So for your family, people that I love, Carol, you've been amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3507.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to make sure Rick is here with us, and I don't think he's ever missed a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3512.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if I missed a meeting, I'd always get an email, a text message right away saying, where are you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3517.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I felt guilty to say, my God, Rick, I'm stuck at work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3520.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because no matter what, even after the election, he was still here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3523.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even after the election, people are still calling him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3525.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was at the door the other day, and I was like, after the election, and I said, what are you doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3533.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He had a truck full of turkeys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3535.236s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He says, do you know anybody who needs a turkey, any family that needs a turkey?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3540.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what I'm talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3541.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what we're going to miss in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3543.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People don't realize that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3544.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's something that when I see your grandchildren, I make sure they know how proud they should be of their papa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3552.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And Rick, you've done an amazing job to set a standard for the Caraviello family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3557.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my friend, all I can say to you is I wish one day George Scarpelli leaves a legacy like Rick Caraviello, because it's not Armin anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3568.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All Armin did was win a few football games.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3571.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Rick Caraviello is what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3575.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we should all aspire to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3577.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will miss you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3579.487s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate everything you've taught me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3581.928s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've appreciated you, the phone calls that you've, you've called me and set me straight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3586.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I was going to go stray, you pulled me back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3589.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I hope I still get those phone calls because we know it's not going to be easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3594.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: President Zach Beers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3596.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Imagine Ricky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3602.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Joking, of course, but I love you, my friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3605.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm proud that this journey in our lives made us brothers and I thank you and I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3614.34s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3615.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5406.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I think that it's tough when it's one person that leaves, but when it's two, it's really tough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5419.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5419.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5421.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Someone that I've worked with, I mean, for a long time now, so I apologize, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5428.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Believe me, I have your speech ready, so I hope you have tissues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5434.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I love listening to kid laugh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5437.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you ever notice that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5438.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's my mission in life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5440.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, it's my mission in life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5441.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I just want everybody to realize, I think that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5449.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You might not agree with him a thousand percent of the time you might get irritated with him Sometimes he does it with a subtle rule or a law, but sometimes he does it with a kick in the face but he does it all for a reason and something that I admire and His passion and love for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5473.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that that's a common denominator tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5476.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5478.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Caraviello touched on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5482.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He is probably the smartest person I've ever been around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5486.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would call him so giddy about something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5488.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I found something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5489.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd say, Adam, how about this rule?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5492.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or how about this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5493.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he'd say, no, that's good, George.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5495.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But how about this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5496.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm like, I was wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5499.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But he wouldn't tell you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5502.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or it would be like, I have to do this, Adam, could you, I sent over a speech.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5507.792s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And 15 minutes later, I'd get something back and say, wow, that's great, but that's nothing of what I sent you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5514.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, it's, when I first started running for school committee, one of the first phone calls I made was to a young man named Adam Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5524.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he was amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5527.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he helped,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5528.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: mold that team that started my journey as an elected official more than 16 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5536.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I admire your passion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5540.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I admire your, what people don't realize is your strong integrity and for what's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5548.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's something that we laugh about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5550.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not going to lie to you, Adam.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5552.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The last couple of months, we've had a few jokes behind your back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5555.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I tell you, people don't realize, when he first got angry because somebody moved all of his paperwork, people don't realize that's years, years of organizing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5570.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if Adam needed anything, if I said something, and I'm like, geez, I don't know where to look for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5573.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd look at Adam, and he would know exactly out of a mound of pile of paperwork that he knew exactly where to go to help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5580.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he probably still has it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5584.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5585.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that knowing the Knight family, and I was fortunate to know his dad and know his beautiful wife and his kids,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5595.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, I think this is good for Adam.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5597.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that the last year that he had has been very difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5601.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's been true to what you're supposed to be and what we should all admire too as a family man that supported his brother through probably his most difficult time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5611.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, um, you know, I wish people would know what you've gone through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5618.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, but as a friend, like I said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5622.236s">[Scarpelli]</a>: my first phone call, then my second phone call to get whether your approval or your understanding or you correcting me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5631.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate that, my friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5632.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And like I said, there's a common denominator tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5637.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sad because I'm not going to see you on a regular basis, that we're going to be mandated to see each other at least every other Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5644.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I'm proud that we're friends and I'm proud that my kids<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5651.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: get to be around Adam Knight because he's a great role model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5655.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know my daughter Gianna loves him and his family and I know John is at Merrimack and he's following Adam's footsteps out of Merrimack and I know how much Dina loves both you and Rick and what you guys have done for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5674.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm gonna miss you my friend and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5677.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I thank this opportunity because I have a good friend that I feel I can count on for the rest of my life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5685.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5738.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, all right, kid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5757.756s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Buy the coffee, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7258.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I, uh, Councilor Morelle, I just, Council President, um, I'm honored to call you president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7266.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think I've reached out to you some tough meetings and I wanted to, you know, publicly say that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7274.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you've handled yourself with grace and honor, and I think you've been a true leader to this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7279.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like Councilor Caraviello said, it's not easy when your community is viewed as divided, you know, the new metric, the old metric.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7289.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I would get phone calls, imagine this Morell, I said, imagine this Morell, imagine Nicole Morell would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7299.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: take an opportunity to stand up and run for an office that's not traditionally for an independent, strong woman, and come in and do what you've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7310.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I thank you because you give my daughter the understanding that you can reach for anything you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7319.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we haven't seen eye to eye to everything, but it was always out of respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7324.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what people don't understand is that it's for a reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7330.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And Nicole Morell doesn't go home at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7332.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They tell people, yeah, but Nicole definitely goes home at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7335.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How can I destroy that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7338.514s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It became comical at times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7340.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think you've stood up and you have taken the leadership with honor, with grace, with distinction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7350.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm proud that I've served with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7354.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that the most honorable thing in life, I think I've, in my life that I've ever seen, is watch my wife raise our two amazing kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7364.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And tonight, it like kicked me like a mule watching you with your baby and understand the huge sacrifices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7373.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I remember the nights that you'd have to run out of here for 20 minutes and run back and people didn't know why, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7380.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: your mom first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7382.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you taking this hiatus, I know that when everything moves forward like we expect and have a positive growth with your beautiful son, that you'll be back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7399.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that we appreciate the four years that you've given us, and I appreciate you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7407.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: being our leader and I think that I hope that we do see you around still and I'm sure that if you see me go the wrong way that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7418.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One thing people don't realize, I don't think, is how tough you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7421.183s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And George Scott Pell likes to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7425.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People think I yell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7426.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm yelling at people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7427.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't yell at people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7428.548s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is how I speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7430.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Ask my wife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7430.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just talk loud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7433.671s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's great because you give it right back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7436.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there was some things me and you would talk about right here, and you'd say, oh yeah?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7440.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you forget two years ago?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7441.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm like, oh wow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7443.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm like, ooh, ooh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7445.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it's out of respect, and I appreciate that, because I think that's what this council is so great about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7452.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done some great things, and we've respected each other enough to agree to disagree, but not cross the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7461.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so I thank you, and I wish you much luck and happiness at home, and enjoying your beautiful son.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7472.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and I'm sure we'll see you around, so I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7474.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=346.842s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=434.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, I looked at both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=438.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I did, I found them all, I found them in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=443.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd second the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=517.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=518.705s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=520.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Due to the rain, my schedule was diverted to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=524.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm in and out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=525.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I apologize for my absence in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=528.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But yeah, if I know this is exciting because I know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=535.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sushi is one of my family's favorite foods, but we wanted to make sure if the petitioner could give us a little brief description of their business, and then we can move on with my comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=571.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=572.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, just a couple of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=575.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We do see everything is in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=578.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The petitioner did everything they needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=580.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything is signed off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=582.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are you familiar with our hours or operations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=609.621s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=611.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the hours of operations that you're looking for, I know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=624.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=627.91s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I do see everything in order, and if my colleagues have any questions, I would move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=667.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, you can meet with the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=668.487s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that would, that might help you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=698.486s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=700.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=723.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you again, Madam President and the Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=725.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I do have all the paperwork, everything is in order, but if the petitioner could give us a brief description.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=733.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that boba tea is very, very popular, but just a description of your process would be important, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=770.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=771.913s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I see everything in order, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=777.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=778.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My colleagues have any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=840.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=841.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I'm glad to see with such changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=844.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we heard some sad news yesterday about a few establishments closing on Middlesex Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=851.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the very popular site of Tiki Island, I'm glad that there's someone taking this over and the reputable<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=863.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: owner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=863.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is all of the paperwork seems in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=866.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that just understanding the hours of operations that was an established business for a long time, and understanding the amount of employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=875.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that if we just got a brief description of what we're doing, and then just answer those questions, and then open it up to our call my colleagues, that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=929.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have done some little research and she is a reputable owner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=933.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we appreciate the opportunity to keep that business going, the Tiki Island spot going with such an owner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=943.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that the hours of operations, I'm trying to find it on the sheets that I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=951.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that-<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=968.949s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But that's what I just wanted to make sure we had that because I know a lot of the permits leave with the existing owner and their application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=978.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I do see everything else in order, Madam President, I would move approval after any comments that my colleagues might have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1018.407s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know council because was saying I think the Buddha is very very important that they keep it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1089.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1092.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't wanna waste anyone's time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1095.261s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm gonna be popping in and out, so instead of going and asking for individual votes to move forward, I'll text Councilor Caraviello when I pop back in, so I don't waste anyone's time, because I have to pop back into a program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1111.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=250.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=252.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a first-generation U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=256.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: resident and Method resident, I was born to Italian-born parents who grew up in northern Italy in two little towns in Calabria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=271.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they came to this country, the greatest country in the world, to make something of themselves and for their families and start<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=280.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the legacy that they would be proud of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=282.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They came to this community and they loved Medford and appreciate Councilor Knight, excuse me, Councilor Caraviello for speaking earlier, but you have to understand there's still so many Italian Americans in Medford that were raised like me and have parents like mine and the sacrifices they made and to be just part of that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=307.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that history and that pride of being an American citizen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=313.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's funny, my dad, while my mother raised, well, she parented four children on her own, while my dad worked as a member of Revere Sugar, he worked at a meat packing company and at glass cutting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=330.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: company while going to Don Bosco High School to learn English because, as he said it, it was his honor to learn the language of the great country he moved to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=344.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that stands for a lot of Italian-Americans, proud Italian-Americans that live in Medford today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=349.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And just to acknowledge that fact that this is a good time to mention what they've done to make Medford what it is today, whether it's the arts, whether it's education, whether it's, you know, in the, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=367.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the political field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=369.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have Italian Americans, greatness all over this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=374.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate is bringing this forward and acknowledging this this time for the Italian Americans of metric.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=381.575s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=626.364s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=626.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council cover will bring this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=628.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that again a great method family when you talk about, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=634.613s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our friends at Alexander's again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=637.035s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Another another small business that is quick to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=644.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this death does hit South Medford hard, and the family of Alexander's just doesn't, it spreads throughout our community, so condolences to the family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=656.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=726.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hi, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=726.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Ribeiro, how are you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=730.953s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, this is a transfer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=734.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's going over to, you're taking over?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=737.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: From the Catracalla family?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=739.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is good news because there was a big question in that community, that neighborhood that we hope it was staying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=747.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is great news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=748.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you could just tell us a little bit about your concept and what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=772.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's great news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=773.258s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I see everything is in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=775.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, I know that, are you familiar with the hours of operations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=780.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And any, you realize that hours of operations that was granted to Bocelli's has to stop with them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=786.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=787.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then any extended hours, you have to come back for a special permit?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=790.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=790.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so I know my fellow colleagues have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=794.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see everything in order to move forward, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=832.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hi, how are you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=834.91s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So a new business and on High Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=837.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is very exciting, especially when you see said to me, what is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=843.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Maniscalco?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=845.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Rudy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=845.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=845.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So why don't you give us a description of what we're going to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=874.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, I can only imagine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=876.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this looks, I mean, everything is in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=879.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Your hours of operations, if you could just share with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=892.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=892.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, Madam President, I also see everything in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=896.107s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=897.888s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My colleagues have any questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2204.52s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President, and thanks for presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2207.621s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For one, Councilor, I've had a serious issue with how the community, how this community, our leadership team, really puts together the vision of our growth and development plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2222.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We say we have a comprehensive plan, but it is all over the place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2228.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To me, there are so many questions with this building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2232.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A, you're on probably one of the most busiest intersections, one of the biggest concerns of traffic in this community, huge issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2242.088s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How many people do you plan on occupying this building on a day-to-day basis?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2265.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Possibly 80, 100 people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2267.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there's only 23 parking spots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2270.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It abuts a neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2334.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2337.417s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As you can see, there's no guarantee for any business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2340.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if you last five to 10 years, the next business comes in and has no philosophy or belief in the same as you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2347.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, it affects our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2352.423s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please don't take this personal, because I would love to find a location for this type of development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2357.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2359.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we've turned a few away that has really hurt us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2362.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think the biggest issue I see<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2366.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is we don't have a true development plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2370.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You saw how it looks there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2372.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It looks out of place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2375.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a beautiful building, but it's out of place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2378.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have a community of two to three family homes no more than 100 yards away from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2384.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're talking about an intersection that has been habitually taken advantage of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2389.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're talking about a neighborhood that has felt that they have been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2394.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they have been treated so unfairly and overlooked so many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2398.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's a lot of variables that has nothing to do with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2401.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I want you to understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2402.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that when we talk about development and you look at the plan of Mystic Ave, man, I would love to see, I mean, the idea can be sold so easily when you're building<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2415.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: four, five, six, 10 similar locations, all the way down Mystic Ave, where there's establishments to eat, go for a drink, go for shopping, to live.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2426.107s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a community, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2428.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a community building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2429.888s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then when you're trying to sell the concept of 100 people in only 23 spots and thinking that now it's not gonna affect it, everybody's gonna drive a bike or a bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2438.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We wish that could be the case, but that's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2441.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At least that's what the neighbors, the neighbors that we deal with every day in that community, you have to understand, they're scorned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2447.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're part of this community that have been bypassed in many different levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2453.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As I'm sitting here right now, I'm getting text messages of people that live right on that road that are disgusted that we're even talking about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2461.746s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's a shame that, and I'll say it publicly, I think this is the concept, this is beautiful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2466.969s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That building is beautiful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2469.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, I think the idea of it, you know, when you see neighboring communities, like I'm sure you have, you see the assembly road, you see what's going on in Malden, you see what's happening in Everett, you're seeing this type of development grow together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2483.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we have a unicorn sticking out of an eight-story unicorn sticking out of probably the most densely populated traffic area that we've had so many issues in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2495.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I personally, not anything you did, but what this administration has done when we talk about development and growth, not having a true picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2507.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If the city sat next to you, stood next to you,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2511.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the development department sat with you, and they said, George, this is our plan, and this is what it's gonna look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2517.814s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I sat with a gentleman years ago in a disgusting field in Somerville, and he opened this door, and he showed me this full life-size model of something called Assembly Row.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2528.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And his vision was talking about gateway communities, talking about how when you enter Somerville, this is what it's gonna look like, this is what's gonna grow to this, this is what's gonna grow to that, and guess what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2539.171s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2540.636s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just this great little shop area now has buildings for health care, buildings for corporate development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2549.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's grown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2549.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People, a tea stop right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2552.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So of course you don't need parking there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2554.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you see how crazy it is there now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2556.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is what we're not having in Metro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2558.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just personally think that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2562.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you're a catalyst to say, okay, here is the perfect development team that wants to come back and talk about Lincoln, talking about taking care of the community, talking about parking issues, talking about environmental issues, looking at the sciences, and let's use them as a catalyst to say, okay, this is gonna be here, and this is how we're gonna grow that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2581.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If that was presented today, I would say to the neighbors that, hey, you can't question growth, but all they're seeing, like it was just said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2590.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's just standing out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2592.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It just doesn't belong there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2594.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there are too many questions right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2596.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why I wouldn't be able to support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2598.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's not, believe me, it's not personal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2599.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that your concept, if it rolled down the street with five other buildings, with the concept of this is what we want from Mystic Ave, we're just not seeing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2610.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not seeing that from the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2611.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And for this Councilor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2613.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For the neighbors that have reached out to me that are nervous about these issues of parking, sense of community, sense of traffic, sense of lifestyle change, they think this one building without understanding the concept after this building and what that means to their neighborhood is what's giving them the fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2631.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that has opened my eyes to say, I can't support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2634.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I hope you can understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2636.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I just hope the city opens their eyes and says, how do we help our developers get the support of their council by presenting a plan for the city that's gonna show this area, by the way, probably the last of the Mohicans, the last area close to Boston that we can build on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2655.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know how important that corridor is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2658.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That corridor is huge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2659.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The last corridor leads into Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2661.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we know how important that land is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2664.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But without a plan from the city and from what I'm hearing with neighbors and their issues with what we talked about, and even before you were here, God, it took us years to put in a crosswalk right at that set of lights because of the dangerous area that it is and the heavy trafficked area that it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2686.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I hope you can understand that's how I feel and I appreciate you being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2690.142s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Could I make a couple comments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2691.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4345.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just moving forward, I heard some things that my fellow council said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4351.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They sound great if there was a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4355.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One of my fellow councils sounded a little desperate today, and I truly don't think we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4358.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is an opportunity for us as a community to really set the groundwork for what one of my colleagues said, to really rejuvenate a corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4369.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And from another one of my colleagues said, really set that gateway, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4374.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've obviously developed this, you've seen it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4377.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so I'm sure that, I'm not asking for your comment, but I'm sure that you can see my point of view when we're looking at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4384.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: smart growth and development, and what we're seeing is spot growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4390.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a comprehensive plan that really is not involved comprehensively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4396.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that our director is on the call tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4400.161s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is there a diagram, is there a vision of the Mystic Ave Corridor that Office of Community Development<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4410.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4411.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I would like to see the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4411.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh peers across the Commonwealth set the groundwork the table to show Councilors in their cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4418.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What that would look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4420.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I would tell you if this was the beginning of this gateway in the beginning of this, this open corridor of beautiful, uh, open space with with smart<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4439.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the water and electricity, whether we have the traffic and parking concerns answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4446.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are things that have been concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4448.969s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They haven't been answered for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4451.487s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, and I love the idea that you want to vote for it because we put this in place for this purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4456.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't put it in for this purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4458.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We put it in for this purpose to start the development process so we could grow an area, not just pop up one building that neighbors are directly affected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4468.92s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as a matter of fact, what neighbors are they?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4471.041s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're not the neighbors on Lawrence Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4474.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're not the neighbors on Grove Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4476.165s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're the neighbors that we talk about every day that are always impacted negatively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4481.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this building's gonna come right up in front of their homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4485.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Their buildings, this one building is gonna impact an area that traffic-wise has been stressed to us before these gentlemen even came to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4495.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what I ask our director, is there a plan in place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4500.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know there's a comprehensive plan that's out there and that we reviewed, but is there something that we could see tangibly, hold on and look at and say, wow, look at the beginning of the growth of this corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4584.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4584.98s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the answer is no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4585.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there really isn't something there yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4587.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So why rush?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4591.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4591.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I remember in a little community next door, they settled for this company called IKEA to go in the middle of their plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4603.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then once it blew up, what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4606.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Once it's really took off, what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4608.221s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They had to reach out to this company and say, we have to move you because the vision has changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4614.663s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No disrespect to anybody here, but we don't have a vision yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4618.764s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All we have in Wellington is somebody that wants to build there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4622.805s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4623.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All we have is this organization that wants to just build on Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4627.827s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's do it then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4629.839s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't see anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4630.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, we have one bite.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4632.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're the only, only community left that abuts Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4637.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is valuable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4638.842s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't, we're not begging for anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4640.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is valuable, valuable development space that we should grow with responsibility and make sure we have all the factors in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4651.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We already said it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4652.407s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have all the factors in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4655.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna prove this without knowing if it's gonna handle the safety of that roadway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4659.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if it's gonna handle the traffic of that neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4664.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, again, it's nothing personal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4667.705s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something I've been saying, whether it's you or any other company, any other development company that's here right now, we need development seriously bad in Metro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4677.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done nothing in the last four years, nothing, zero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4681.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But because of that inability to grow,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4687.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we've now left ourselves in a pretty valuable situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4691.065s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So as our director just said, if we can wait 18 months, we're gonna have a better opportunity here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4699.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At least that's the way I'm looking at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4700.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe I shouldn't say verbatim, but that's what I just heard, that they were off at 18 months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4705.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So imagine if we wait 18 months, what the vision and what answers we can have to make sure that Florida fits everything we want for those neighbors that again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4716.164s">[Scarpelli]</a>: are always the ones that people don't look to support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4721.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know because I'm getting the information from them on a regular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4727.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, listen, I don't wanna be the catalyst and stand here and say, follow me, but you have to understand that this isn't personal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4736.548s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is one Councilor that's fighting for the neighbors of that community that still don't know what that card is gonna look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4744.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All they know is we're putting an eight story building jammed into a little area of the corner with no parking and still have issues with traffic, safety,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4756.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in infrastructure issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4758.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=448.466s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information, Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=450.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think what Amy's talking about is these positions were all voted by members of this council, not unanimously, but it was voted by members of this group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=458.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what she's saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1027.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Amy Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1029.995s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand your frustration, and but again this is the fundamental issues we're having<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1035.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and society, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1036.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody wants to talk about supporting the union.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1039.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It sounds good, it looks good on your paraphernalia you're gonna mail out that you're supported or you're whatever for this, but I want you to realize, and I want my fellow councils to realize, this is something I've been saying from the beginning, any money paper that's come, unless it was urgent, I voted no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1058.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any vote for raises for non-union employees, I voted no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1062.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I implored, I expressed that to my fellow Councilors and they passed, unfortunately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1068.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I voted no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1070.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I will tell you is the other issue that I see, it's pretty damaging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1074.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you look behind you, I don't see one male.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1078.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't see one male employee that hasn't got when they need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1082.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know this council in the past have talked about the rights of women and making sure there's equality here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1088.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't see that either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1090.636s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So here's the thing, I'm not afraid either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1092.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I lived in this community my whole life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1095.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been an elected official since I left teaching in 2008.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1100.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not afraid to say what I have to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1103.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what I'm sad for you is you're being used as a pawn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1108.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unions are being used as a pawn, whether it's the lieutenant governor, whether it's the governor's office, whether it's state representatives or whether it's this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1117.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what can I tell you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1119.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can't tell you anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1120.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're going through horrible negotiations because nobody is standing up for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1124.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1125.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right now, I thought today, when I came here, I said, well, this is the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1130.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've talked about a council that have worked together pretty closely in the past year, making sure good initiatives get passed, even without any of the tools that were promised us last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1141.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is the time, when we vote later, you're going to realize where you should focus on, where the city should focus on, where unions should focus on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1151.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I'll be honest with you, if you keep giving and you keep giving, what is she gonna do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1158.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's gonna keep taking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1159.466s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Until what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1161.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You say stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1163.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Last year we said stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1165.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And at least we were heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1169.29s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At least we were heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1171.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With the presentation later with the budget, I know Councilor Caraviello has worked extensively in putting some numbers together, that when I think that people hear it, and if anybody would vote for this budget after you hear these numbers, it'll be appalling for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1187.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what I could tell you and your fellow colleagues that are getting the short end of the stick again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1195.051s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is all I could do is apologize from one city councilor to one department in the city that keeps us running every single day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1201.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I apologize that you haven't even have to go through this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1204.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a disgrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1207.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is sad for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1272.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You wouldn't know what compound is because you weren't given a raise for six years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1275.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that actually explained to you later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1276.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You wouldn't know that, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2307.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President, I appreciate the time and I would just tell you know, everybody has their own opinions of what they have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2314.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I too was a member of the negotiating team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2317.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a union members in the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2319.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I then battled for contracts for teachers as a city school committee member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2326.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm on the negotiating team municipality, neighbor community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2329.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm a union member, my parents have been union members their whole lives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2333.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One thing we've always learned and we saw it play out right in front of us when the country was going to close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2339.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2340.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Each party stood strong until they figured out what was best for what their needs were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2345.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here we are right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2347.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we've all agreed behind this rail, that making sure fair labor practices, making sure that there's equitable, equitable pay when it comes to our non union or union employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2358.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said that every single time a vote came up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2363.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if we stood strong, Amy, my belief, if we stood strong on the no's all the way through,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2371.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: then it comes to the position where we have to do the right thing for everybody or nobody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2375.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So right now, this is why the city is so divided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2378.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why morale, someone told me the other day when I mentioned it after I've talked to many different department heads, believe it or not, that morale here is terrible, and I can see why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2387.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So all I can say is this, what my fellow councilors saying, they're not wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2393.47s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2394.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is our power.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2396.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you, the power that we have today to vote yes and no for the contract, for the budget, just like we did last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2405.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just like we did last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2407.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we thought we won last year, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2409.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We thought we finally got what we needed to make this body work better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2413.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2415.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not one promise was fulfilled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2416.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2419.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No different than what you're going through so this is going to be a very interesting evening tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2423.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the community will see where we stand as a, as a council, where we stand and where we want the city to go, because if it's, if it's going to be, you know, pick and choose, like, it's being done on the city side with non union and dividing us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2439.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we're gonna see that here, then we're in a bad state for the next few years here, if that's gonna be the case, that stays the trend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2446.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I apologize and I told you that, and I appreciate you for coming up, I really do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2452.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know what, they have to see the people that it hurts, because I don't think people see, that's the other piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2458.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have a newspaper, people don't see it every day, what they see is fluff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2463.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A lot of people like to see the fluff and the happiness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2465.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What they don't like to see is what's happening right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2468.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You standing up there and saying there are people, there are ladies, women behind you that work hard for the city that are hurting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2474.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I just want you to know, I know the president has given us more than enough time to talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2481.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2482.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But there's nothing else we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2483.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2484.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2486.571s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3308.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3310.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3311.794s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Chris, again, I want to take the time to I know we expressed it as a council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3316.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to thank the Football Association and the high school football team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3319.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But whenever you think you guys are done, what I saw, what I saw and what I heard with the Kiwanians and feeding the, helping with the food insecurities and working together with Chelsea and making sure that again, Medford stood above it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3336.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I want to applaud the members of your team and the coach and staff for really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3344.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: really looking at what being a high school athlete is truly all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3347.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not, you know, if we looked at the wins and losses, that's, that's pretty small way of looking at this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3354.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the way that this football team, our football team brings so much pride to this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3360.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And for me personally, um, I just have to applaud the association coach Curly and his staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3366.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And most importantly, the kids in that team, cause they, they really, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3372.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: really standing above and showing what true superstars they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3376.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, thank you very much for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3581.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3583.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Some tragic news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3586.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, when Chris brings up<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3588.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: people that have given to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3590.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a gentleman who kids grew up in Medford, coached his youngest son, watched Freddy Rita give back to the kids in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3606.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when people weren't supposed to give to this much time and effort for certain type of kids,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3615.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Freddie would go and find the kids that couldn't afford a pair of cleats, or a pair of shin guards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3621.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he would make sure that he would buy those cleats and buy those shin guards, and then he'd put them on a team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3627.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then when at the time there was, you know, this infighting with method you soccer, and some people thought that kids in need really weren't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3636.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: getting the attention they deserve, Freddie and some others, dedicated members of the community, decided to start a new league called Method United.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3645.963s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they did that, not because of ego, but to make sure every kid was represented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3652.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it worked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3654.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what happened after a few years, that group then became, came together again as a true Method youth soccer organization that we see today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3663.613s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A true vision of what the demographic of what Method truly looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3672.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The canvas that is Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3674.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And Freddie's love for the game of soccer and Freddie's passion to help kids was evident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3683.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Freddie's a great story because I saw him a few weeks ago at a baseball game and we were talking and I didn't realize Freddie was an orphan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3693.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, there's no way that an orphan has the ability to raise such an amazing family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3699.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what he did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3700.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He raised amazing children and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3704.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: His wife, Adele, is just one of the best people that I've ever met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3708.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And unfortunately, Freddy lost his life mowing his lawn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3715.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's something that I know my family, myself, we're gonna miss Freddy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3721.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was very special.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3723.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we send our condolences to his family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3725.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was one of the great ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3727.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4378.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4379.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4380.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4381.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, Daniel, thank you for being a tight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4383.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How was the participation with the, uh, in these meetings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4387.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do we have a lot of community input?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4389.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, is that something that's that was that that was different?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4394.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, it was not as normal as usual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4423.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So not a big turnout of negatives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7208.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I just have some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7210.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7210.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know we can answer these questions, Miss Desmond, but I think that the points that were brought up that I want to bring forth as we move on, I think that we're, I think,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7226.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: any community that has a reputable establishment like raising canes to come into community I think it's a plus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7234.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I also think that the most important pieces is understanding what the neighbors that really about that location, and how that affects them and I think that that's why these are the questions that I have right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7247.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, I've gone back and forth with different neighbors, and they've called me back and forth, and the talk of using Dunkin' Donuts as an example, being open, having the drive-through, and so on and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7259.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that what's different with this is when they bought their homes, it was always an establishment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7264.695s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was Mr. Donut, Dunkin' Donuts, there was something always there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7267.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is an establishment that's coming in with established families and homes that are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7271.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just want to just express what neighbors have called me about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7277.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One being, you know, the issues are going to have a noise, adding patrons at one in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7284.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: usually they're not the quietest people in the world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7286.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, you know, you look at other takeout locations, you look at, for instance, Wendy's or Burger King, really don't about a neighborhood in that sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7297.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but we've also had issues with noise in those locations, but now coming into a neighborhood and understanding that and presenting that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7306.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The other piece is the actual air conditioning units and the nerve,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7314.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's been mentioned before being on the on the subcommittee and chairperson for lighting and signs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7318.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7340.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a very tough time and making sure we abide by these certain issues and blinking lights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7345.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's great that we did these traffic mediations and all this stuff, but all you did now is we've added more lights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7352.34s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've added more lights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7354.362s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So understanding how that is going to work with the neighbors and the people that have maybe a bedroom that abuts it maybe even 100 feet away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7364.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7365.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7367.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know the traffic issues, the way the design shows I, I don't, I don't see a real issue with that with the flow that it shows really directed people away so I think that that isn't a big issue I don't I don't think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7381.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But then I don't know if people have told you in that area we have a huge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7385.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: huge rodent issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7386.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now they're nervous that holy cow, we've had this rodent issue in this community and no one's responded to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7393.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one has come back to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7395.671s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they looked at different, they looked at stop and shop and different, you know, facilities that have food.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7401.035s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now you're bringing that 100 feet, 100 yards away from their home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7404.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: an eating establishment so now the nerves are heightened, and I just wanted to bring that up as, as we proceed through this process that these are really the contacts of information I got from from residents in that area so, and I know you know, I'm sure you agree with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7420.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are very sensitive topics and they're very valuable but it's something as we move forward that I wanted to make sure I made after your presentation I brought that up because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7430.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the residents that reached out to me, I told him, listen and watch the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7435.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why I asked previously to Danielle, if there was really public participation, her comments were well, here's today's public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7443.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that tells me we really didn't do much to really even though there were a couple of signs and we hit some of butters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7450.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The neighbors that I've talked to said they really weren't informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7453.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, that's neither here nor there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7455.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not your fault or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7456.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the city clerk this other reasons, but I just wanted to share that with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7513.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so I know that we've gone through this before with other facilities and other establishments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7521.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not, it's really aesthetic, it's not really set to hinder the decimal system, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7528.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Decimal level, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7542.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7543.792s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we've had some studies in the past that have shown that if it's not made as a deterrent where the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7557.159s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the make of it isn't made to hinder the noise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7561.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It really, whether it's going up or down, this is, again, this is something new from the neighbors that live across the street on the other side, having, they don't know that until it's done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7571.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's why it's coming up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7573.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is there a way that something that's aesthetic that can also be, you know, protected by, you know, with the noise level that they could do both?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7583.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7586.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that something we can look at?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7587.64s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know that this is these are things that the neighbors have asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10060.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council night, but the restriction with the trash pickup.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12249.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's point of information question would be to my fellow councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12252.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At the beginning of that you said the leadership, how and when was this leadership taken, and we're all of this council privy to that discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12265.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so the President and the Vice President met with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12270.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you saying you had you met with the mayor and you had the agenda that you and the president had to present to the mayor without the input of fellow councils, five other fellow councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12281.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that true?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12289.904s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12292.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did this leadership team meet with this council person and say, we're going to the mayor as our leadership team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12299.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did our leadership team come to this councilor that represents the people of the city and say, we have a plan that we want to present to the mayor as a councilor, do you agree?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12309.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you give me that opportunity?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12312.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12313.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12314.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that this agreement you have is fraudulent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12318.764s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It doesn't, it does not encompass what this, you can't put, you can't say, Madam President, that the leadership of this council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12328.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: eliminating some Councilors in that decision and say that this isn't a fraudulent decision that you've made?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12339.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it smells, if it walks like a duck, and it looks like a duck, it's a duck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12347.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I call into question for what you just said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12350.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12351.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information, the Councilor came into this chamber, looked at me and said to me and my fellow Councilor and said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12359.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talk with the mayor and we have an agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12363.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who is weak?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12364.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I'm not weak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12368.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I'm not weak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12369.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this council to say that my leadership with YouTube, and you represent me one Councilor, I don't care about anybody else right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12376.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You represent this council, you never you to never talk told me about this presentation, you were going to give the mayor and what what negotiations you were going to have with the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12387.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you're telling me the mayor met with YouTube, and you had an agreement that you think that you were going to work out to give her the votes that she needs to pass this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12413.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So on the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12414.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And because of open meeting, we're not allowed to have a conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12417.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Excuse me, excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12419.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He has the floor originally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12437.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, did the leadership talk to counter Caraviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12442.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a question I have, did the leadership talk to Councilor Knight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12445.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did the leadership talk to Councilor Collins?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12449.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did the leadership talk to Councilor Tseng?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12451.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And did the leadership talk to Councilor Scarpelli?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12454.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did the leadership do those things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12455.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if you did,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12457.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and without consulting maybe two or three or four and not all seven, then I'm going to have a problem with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12463.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm going to make sure that we look into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12465.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if you did that, if you individually talk to each Councilor and presented a plan that went to the mayor to negotiate something without all of us together, I find it to be a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12485.316s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Villes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12486.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You said leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12487.717s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What are you asking about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12489.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just asked you the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12490.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you talk to Councilor- Did I violate the open meeting law?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12493.698s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, no, did you meet, I never said that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12495.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said, I didn't say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12497.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said, I said, did you individually, I didn't say violate an open meeting law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12502.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you individually meet with other councilors to present a plan that you were gonna bring to the mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12509.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Be careful now, because there are ways to find things out now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12512.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the question I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12516.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you meet with other members of this council one on one didn't not saying you violate any open meeting law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12523.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you meet with other Councilors and present the plan that then went to the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12530.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12531.907s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you talk to Councilman Caraviello?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12534.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did you count Scott's concept?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12547.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because why do you have a meeting with us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12548.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why did you put this up in a meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12550.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These discussions occurred between other meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12553.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, it doesn't look good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12556.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It doesn't make it that this council, all due respect, this council's worked hard to work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12561.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this council has been standing side by side with all of these negative initiatives that we will follow through, we'll continue with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12569.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because there's a lot that's gonna be said tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12571.821s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to go through that and then make a decision after talking to only three Councilors or two Councilors and then going to the mayor personally and negotiating something for what's best, the leadership for what's best for us in this city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12585.331s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You didn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12587.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nobody consulted me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12587.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: From what I gather, nobody consulted Councilor Caraviello or Councilor Knight or Councilor Collins, as you said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12595.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I find that a real problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12598.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12599.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12628.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then I moved to table this meeting for another next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12632.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13335.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not done yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13336.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not done yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13338.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if you're interested in... It's a question because I'm sure this point of information is simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13343.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The question is this, does this body, the city council, are we not supposed to do what this council just said yes or no, what you just said, are we not supposed to be including what you just said, I'm bringing it to you as the first opportunity to you what I'm saying is, our duties as city Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13367.054s">[Scarpelli]</a>: supposed to be given the respect of what you negotiated with as a normal process as a city councilor and that's what we want but you didn't do that that's exactly what we get we're gonna get that next budget we we get it anyway we don't by law we get it anyway obviously councilor collins was next to be recognized<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13781.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That'd be nice if she was that was a question I was going to jump in if I can matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13784.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13786.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can you tell us who's on the call as department heads?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13804.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The superintendent isn't on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14235.779s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is, this council is gonna vote on a budget today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14239.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we talked about, there was some changes that were made that really made you think of, this is what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14245.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I asked my fellow councilors to listen to what we just heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14250.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna take $500,000, $600,000 of ESSER money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14254.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna settle the budget on an election year to make everybody happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14259.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then next year, the teachers that you talk about, the kids that you talk about that you love,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14265.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna be in such dire disrepair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14268.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know how we're gonna dig out of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14271.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what's frightening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14273.065s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Understand what we're doing right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14275.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Caraviello presented the numbers that came out of the budget book.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14278.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate the numbers you shared with me, because these are outstanding numbers that when we talk about funding for this community, of funding for a budget, of funding for a prop two and a half, of funding for these different projects, understand this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14295.148s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Planning and development $703,000 budgeted 226,000 was used 32% was the budget was spent 32% we spent police 14.3, we spent 7.4 51% of the budget wasn't spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14315.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: DPW 12.9 spent 6.7, 52% of the budget wasn't spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14323.088s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Fire department, excuse me, after DPW, these are the big five right now that we're bringing up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14328.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the total expenditure is we're looking at, we're talking millions of dollars that have been mismanaged that we could have used<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14340.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we could have used to fix these gaps in the library, to fix the gaps in the school department, to fix the gaps on the streets and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14349.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Instead, this council voted for bonds, 2.5 million, 2 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14355.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We voted for bonds to do the work that was already in the budget, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14359.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are your numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14360.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are the numbers that came from this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14364.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To see that we over-budgeted this much money is a gross, a gross mishandling of our city's funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14373.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not yours, not mine, this community's funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14378.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is appalling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14380.148s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about millions and millions of dollars that we didn't use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14384.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So listen, I'm looking at apples to apples before we got this information, before we got to finally sit down, because when you get the budget book on the Friday or Father's Day weekend, it's really tough to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14396.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when we get to this point and we talk about what are we doing, in most communities, as you brought up, Madam Chief of Staff,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14405.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In most communities, like tomorrow night, I'll be sitting in Somerville, it's called Cut Night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14410.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Every department head will be here to support any questions at the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14413.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the respect they get.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14416.437s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The biggest budget line we have is education, and our superintendent isn't even here to answer a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14423.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I had other questions that was brought to my attention after looking at the capital plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14428.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For instance, the neglected fields behind Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14433.035s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that have been out past this day over five years, that if we end up doing a study, which happens every year, it should, and it shows that that field is unsafe, we have to close two of the most important fields down the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14446.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't see anything, which is a huge revenue generator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14450.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what I was going to ask the superintendent tonight, but she's not here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14455.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are serious issues that we don't have any department head in front of us that we can ask these questions, because I would love to talk to the department heads, because I'm gonna be honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14466.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've talked to some department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14468.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've talked to people that are in the know, because believe it or not, there are still relationships here, and they're petrified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14475.427s">[Scarpelli]</a>: George, don't ever speak my name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14477.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just want you to understand that the confusion they have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14483.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with the way we run a budget, they're very confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14486.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because when they do their lines, and they then match up what's presented to them, they're totally confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14493.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I bet you what, if I do a Freedom of Information Act, and I ask for any communications between department heads to a director of finance, we're gonna see some questions that department heads are very confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14508.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we talk about this budget, when we've been talking about this budget as a union, we've been talking about what the mismanagement has been with this council for months, if not a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14519.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For what we've been promised, what we weren't, remember that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14522.613s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Remember, I'm gonna not say the council's name, but remember, I will never let that happen to me again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14529.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor lied to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14530.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will never let it happen to me again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14534.005s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She promises everything last year at one o'clock in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14536.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We get nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14537.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Here we are today to consider that you're going to vote for this budget with these questions befuddling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14548.168s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these are serious issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14550.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are issues that this councilor, I'm going to reach out and find out on what avenues we can take to do a deep dive in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14558.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we do an audit, but this is something that frightens me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14562.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if Councilor Caraviello said it's a pattern, this is one year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14565.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it's a pattern for three years, what are we doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14568.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a gross mismanagement of our city funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14572.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a gross mismanagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14574.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14576.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Take a deep breath, go sit down with your budget book, because when I asked this question, if this was real or not, it's in your numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14584.824s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's in your book.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14587.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are not just a couple of percent, because I've asked a couple of finance directors in neighboring communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14592.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Rarely you look at an overage about two and a half to three and a half percent, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14595.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what they look at, usually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14597.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the gap that other communities they say that they put into, about two and a half to three and a half percent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14605.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 32, 51, 52, 57, 59, that's only five departments that we over budgeted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14613.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if this council wants to vote for this budget, when you hear these facts and say, this is better for our community, think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14622.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Think about it, no matter what was said or what was negotiated, think about what the numbers in front of you say before you vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14628.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I tell you, if you support this with this information in front of you,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14634.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope everybody's watching, because remember, you vote, and you represent every member of this community, and you're their fiscal watchdog.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14644.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why I appreciate your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14646.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we talked and you gave me this, I couldn't believe it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14648.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I went back and I looked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14649.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not a really numbers guy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14652.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I went and sat with a few people that I can talk to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14656.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they couldn't believe it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14667.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If this is gonna be, if tonight's gonna be a gotcha game or you win or we win, we all lose if this budget passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14672.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all I have to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14673.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14676.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just if they have a response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15199.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can, so we have other questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15230.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The question was that we have something public that the mayor is agreed with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15235.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Did she not publicly give us other issues last year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15239.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do we not have other public issues last year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15240.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is this what you're going to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15319.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, that is true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15321.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you point of information point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15326.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, with this information you just gave us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15329.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You just openly told us that the numbers we have aren't true, how can we go to this budget should we vote on this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15403.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is Councilor Tseng-Wook done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15448.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry very, very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15452.407s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I find it that it's in doubt that we have a software that the finance director has concerns with and would presented a budget that I find that it's on a slippery slope right now to make a decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15465.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I also think that my fellow councils are making a decision because publicly things were promised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15473.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As if we weren't remember when we were promised the city solicitor, we didn't get one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15478.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: last year when we were given a city solicitor, and we were given the other options that we sat here for and waited for and we got, we never came through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15485.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want you to forget that I want to make sure it's on the public record that I said that, because the reason why my fellow council said they were in favor of this budget because whatever was whatever was discussed and agreed on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15500.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's discussed in open, and it's been, it's public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15504.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15506.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what we've never been lied to before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15511.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, the reason why I say this, and I know, listen, we still have questions that still haven't been answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15521.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I asked for a copy of the consultant<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15526.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: who put the safety of our kids in the high school on the forefront of his report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15533.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've yet to see that report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15535.768s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All we know- The Welsh report?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15537.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, it hasn't been discussed in the budget that even though we haven't, the $900,000 was asked because of the report coming from the school committee, the $900,000 was asked in that report<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15552.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to make Medford High School safe and efficient moving forward, like the addition of principals, like the addition of more paraprofessionals, like the addition of monitors, like the addition of security systems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15568.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now we're gonna vote on something without taking that consultant and not honor what they've said and agree that we'll let ESSER funding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15581.076s">[Scarpelli]</a>: fix the deficit that we all so strongly were negatively against because of this factor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15587.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because all we're doing is pushing this down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15590.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And openly, Madam Mayor, Madam President, this looks like, as long as it gets through this budget season, because November is a very important season, that let's not worry about that now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15601.509s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's just get through the season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15602.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's get through the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15606.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what I see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15607.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just wanted to share that with my fellow Councilors, and I would yield now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15623.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, but the report, we want to see the report, because what I will tell you- I didn't get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15627.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, but what I will tell you too is when I talked to the teachers that were actually interviewed, they were so impressed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15635.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: by the consultant and they had they they finally felt like they were listened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15640.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But after the meeting that I missed on Wednesday, unfortunately, what I found out from some of these teachers that who, by the way, who are now gone, teachers that have been in the system for years who left, they've had enough, they moved on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15651.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's speaking freely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15653.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when they tell me that come September, if these things aren't in place, we're going to be in the same situation of fear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15664.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and safety concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15666.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's what they've shared with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15667.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just wanna share that with you because I haven't seen anything about increase in principals and assistant principals, and we're talking about whatever, and if it is done the way it's funded right now, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15680.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam Chief of Staff, the way it's funded, we're looking at $600,000 right off the top next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15686.177s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So whatever we're gonna implement, it might be good for a year, but then it's all gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15691.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I just don't think that's a sound<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15695.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: fiscal responsible decision we can make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15697.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just don't think so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15699.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15702.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, if you can, I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=19.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=312.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=313.514s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm gonna speak more of a personal level,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=317.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've known Henry a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=318.695s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Henry and my dad were very close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=321.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I remember many a night in Boston Ave in West Medford with Henry, my dad, and Mr. Caggiano just hanging out and drinking homemade wine and telling stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=333.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you just realize, I often talk about when great residents pass on, who steps up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=341.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's refreshing when you could talk about a resident like Henry Miller and his lovely wife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=347.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what they've done for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=349.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's not someone that sits back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=351.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He sees an issue and he attacks it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=354.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he's always there to lend his word, whether you want to hear it or not, whether you like it or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=360.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate his friendship and we should all be honored to have residents like the Miller and family here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=369.096s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=390.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I found them in order and will approve, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=439.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam President, I think that we've already, I think coming from Representative Dash, I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=446.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: would sum it up for us and give us a brief synopsis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=449.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we've already gone through this, but I'd appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=516.431s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I make a recommendation that we table this until October.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=521.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: until date certain, which would be the date of November 28th or meeting that close to that day, whether it's the 1st of December, if that's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=869.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=871.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Bears, for bringing this forward because, you know, listen to everybody's points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=876.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It is a complicated situation, and I think that this brings me to my point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=880.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've talked to a couple of business owners that people aren't realizing some of the traffic calming measures that we've implemented<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=890.928s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll give you an example, one of our local businesses had five delivery drivers that were always on the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=899.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what they're finding right now is he had to let go of two delivery drivers, but the outside agencies, Grubhub, all the other automobile delivery services,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=912.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they've increased, he said, over 75%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=916.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what they're doing is they don't care where they're parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=919.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're still parking in the bike lanes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=921.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're still parking, you know, we've lost control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=924.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the reason why I bring that up is because I think it's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=927.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we move forward to make these decisions, and I appreciate Councilor Bears bringing this up, because I have neighbors calling me about that whole neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=934.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: where it is a cut through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=935.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was no different than what a couple years ago was Fulton Street, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=938.969s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was a Fulton Street area, the corridor, and people have just forgotten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=941.87s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now they're so fed up with it that they're just living with it by now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=945.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The issue I'm seeing is that it's good to do initial conversation with that traffic engineer, but I think we need to start involving the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=954.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I know that I got a few phone calls the other day with the whole idea of eliminating left-hand turns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=961.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, people calling me saying, well, where is that going to now lead the people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=965.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're going to lead them right into their right turns into their neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=969.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're, instead of going 50-50, their discussion is now you're flooding that area with 100% of the traffic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=977.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the truth of the matter is, there is no communication with the neighbors in those neighborhoods that are affected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=985.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate it, but I think we need to move forward with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=989.913s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I support Councilor Bears' initiative in getting our traffic engineer and working on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=995.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that corridor, but at the same time, I think that we should do this shockingly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1001.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I love the word transparent because it's never used in this community, but bringing the neighborhood into the meetings, bringing the neighborhood into the meetings with the traffic engineer and say, okay, what would one solution that you think, how would that solution affect<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1018.283s">[Scarpelli]</a>: other situations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1020.264s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're not seeing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1021.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you know, just today to get emails and phone calls from from residents and business owners saying, you know, George, I know the sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1029.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't know what it checks a certain box.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1031.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the truth of the matter is, his business has increased automobile traffic that are parking, there's no enforcement use, we all see it, lift, whatever they are, whoever they are, they all they pull over wherever they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1048.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they pull into bike lanes, they block driveways, and they do whatever, they are now dictating what happens on our streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1056.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm gonna second Councilor Bears' initiative, but I would really like to see more community participation in these decisions so we can really get a true outlook, outline of what everybody sees, the people that live there every single day, and how one issue<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1076.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: one solution can affect another and just at least vet that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1080.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1917.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1917.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just to share with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1919.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know I've received multiple phone calls, especially Ward 6, that we did get an email from the chief of staff, and I'll read that if that's okay, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1930.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Dear President Morell and city councilors, we recently learned that some addresses who are requesting early voting ballots have received more than one ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1941.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A short while ago, Steve Smerti and I met with elections to better understand what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1948.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, the uh...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1951.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, this process is not, it happened, there's still checks and balances that are in the system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1960.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry, my email is breaking up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1962.69s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In the system that would prevent someone from being able to physically cast multiple ballots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1967.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there are fail-safes to make sure that you cannot vote twice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1972.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Specifically, there is a unique identifier assigned to each voter and only allows them to cast a ballot once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1979.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we learn more about how this happened and steps that are going to be taken to avoid this from reoccurring, we will update the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1987.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that what I appreciate going forward with this resolution is the first thing is just to express that multiple phone calls that are very, very concerned with voter fraud, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2002.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the conspiracy theorists are going crazy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2005.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think my concern right now is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2009.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've seen some pretty drastic issues in the last month dealing with this election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2015.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One being that I believe the ballots, there were misspelled names and they had to redo ballots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2020.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe that's one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2022.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now with these ballots, it's not a few people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2026.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I guess I got a phone call from one person that said they requested two, they got eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2031.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is scary for the sense that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2037.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's gotta be some people held accountable for this situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2043.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this administration is fluffing this over like it's nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2049.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's costing the city a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2051.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's begin with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2052.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if they're giving away ballots, that's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2056.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If the misspelling ballots and then the ballots have to redone in a rush order to make sure that we can have a true election, this is a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2066.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So perception is reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2070.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just, I brought this up just to explain it, understand that I've talked to a very knowledgeable former elections coordinator that told me that George is no way that, you know, what people are saying on the streets, that that person is gonna take eight votes and they're gonna go to the ballot box, they're gonna mail eight votes for so-and-so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2092.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And rest assured, that's not the way it can happen that way because of the fail safes that are on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2098.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2099.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want to make sure everybody knows that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2101.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same time, I think we have to realize something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2106.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're two weeks away from a very big election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2110.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we've had two major flops with this election process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2116.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It doesn't look well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2118.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It doesn't look like it's being handled by a leader in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2125.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, we're moving forward for two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2127.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just pray that we're kept in the loop with everything that's happening because again, unfortunately, I was gonna bring this forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2135.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm glad we got the email beforehand because I believe it was only one district, one precinct that really-<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2145.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2146.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2146.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2146.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2147.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but again, I think moving forward, we need to, we need to buckle down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2152.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, this is, this is, you know, you see what's going on in this country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2156.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Every, the issue in this country is in what's inflammatory is voter fraud and everybody's going crazy about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2164.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not doing ourselves any favors in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2168.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just had to, I had to share my frustration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2172.079s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had to calm some people's nerves and understand publicly that there are fail safes in place, even though they're getting 10 ballots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2179.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm sure I'm gonna get text message and emails later saying, oh, no way, they'll find a way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2184.963s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But there isn't a way that they can use all eight ballots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2190.945s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but again, moving forward, I think we really have to tighten this department up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2196.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it starts with the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2198.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that it sounds political, but truly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2203.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She's the CEO of this community, and this is happening under her watch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2208.453s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something has to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2210.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate it, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2534.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2535.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Bears brings up a great point, not to be insensitive, but we're two weeks away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2540.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who else is supporting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2544.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we have an elections coordinator who's not here two weeks before the election with these issues, who's that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2553.311s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That is true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2553.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's frightening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2554.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who's supporting that department right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2557.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do we have any information with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2567.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2569.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I didn't want but I appreciate because I think it is so sensitive right now, that it is heightened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2576.223s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the fact that who's supporting, you know, I don't, you know, we were very fortunate under clerk, he, you know, we had a great team together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2587.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and Councilor Bears is right, that's something we talked about at budget time, of the reduction of staff, and situations happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2598.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Every employee, they have the right, if they're injured, or sick, or hurt, that they need to take care of what they need to care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2604.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't wanna be insensitive to that at all, but the truth of the matter is, we're still two weeks away from a very important election, in my eyes, because I'm running.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2615.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, you know, I think it's important that I'd like to, if we can, I'd like to make a motion to see, can we ask the administration, are they supporting the staff, even if our director is on remotely, having people in the office is so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2640.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, is this somebody that are they working with maybe getting someone in for the next two weeks and three weeks to try to make sure that we're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2647.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're, we're filling the gaps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2657.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you tell me what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2662.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to say she hasn't been in or I think it was just like, she couldn't attend tonight because I'm just, and I'm just saying, if this is something that's longterm, we really need to find a way that we have assisted, we get assistance to that office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3742.548s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, and in a municipality, anytime there is any any pay that was that was distinguished during a certain time when a retiree was on duty, they would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3757.051s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's automatic, this is confusing me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3759.353s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe it's clerical error, but you can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3763.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not fair labor, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3767.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, it's definitely a fair labor act issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3768.621s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, you're talking about, again, our working men and women in our community, they're telling you that the money that everybody's getting, while you were there too, by the way,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3781.169s">[Scarpelli]</a>: through the through the worst time of our hyperinflation, you were there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3787.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3789.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know if the President can reach out to the city administration to get an answer by as soon as they can to get us an email that the chief of staff can inform us why this is happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3801.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you know if there's anybody else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3803.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that how you're the only person?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3813.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe anything that's negotiated... Right, I was active in negotiations, and I worked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3818.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Anything that's negotiated during the time that any retiree was still in place, they would be... I didn't retire, I actually resigned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3826.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Excuse me, or resigned, doesn't matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3827.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As long as you're working during that time, you are giving the same amount, same treatment, same incentives that they received.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3842.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Shockingly, we have another issue with our labor question with our working men and women here at City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3849.764s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Shockingly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3851.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if we can, I think we need to get word on this and get get it back to us as soon as possible because if, if we haven't, if we have one that's one too many, it was city employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3873.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, well, we can see that, but, you know, rumor has it there's a great team somewhere in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3878.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't seen it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3879.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, I think that, I don't know who to ask because I don't know what department's in and out, but- I'll reach out to the chief of staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3884.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can go HR, chief of staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3898.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, and then ask if there's any other employees, because I bet you there's other employees that just washed their hands of Medford and said, what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3904.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Typical Medford, they walk away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3906.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if they earned it, they deserve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3913.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not worth it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3914.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not fair to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3915.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You deserve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3916.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3916.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's get some answers, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3918.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then if we can, I'll put it on as a resolution for our next meeting to make sure that we follow up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3922.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=3922.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good luck, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2140.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2141.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2148.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm listening and I appreciate that, you know, understanding this with clarity and making sure like we talked about, making sure that the information is out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2159.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think this meeting is perfect because it is the information that will help us guide us for our next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2164.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=123.514s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=262.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Before we go on, can I just address my original question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=268.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=271.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Pete, there are questions, um, that I know that, um, there were some questions about council rules, about limitations when it comes to, to, uh, meetings minutes and how long we could speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=283.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if there are follow up questions, and if there's one question, I believe council bears explain the process that we're using.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=290.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, uh, as council president, I think he wants to move this meeting along, but I just, there were some senior citizens that mentioned,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=298.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if there's some confusion, I hope we have a little leeway when it comes to maybe asking the same question twice because of maybe not understanding it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=306.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I hope we would do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=308.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The other question that Councilor Bears did read, did speak about is that we all asked for information to be sent out to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=318.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor's response, I believe,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=322.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The chief of staff did respond that legally the city couldn't inform or given, I'll just read if I can just so people understand, cause it's a little confusing to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=337.859s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sending this information request, so it's, we sent this email to legal on today to guide us on what we can do, should avoid doing before we can assist given the OCPF guidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=350.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One specific question in mind is whether we can intentionally direct notification advertisement to subset of residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=358.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the following is up on my email below, per council, we can't send unsolicited information<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=365.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to all voters or a portion of voters of the city, whether by mail or by email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=374.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We got that, that response was today, correct, Councilor Bears?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=376.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was 10 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=378.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=378.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we knew that and we needed to change wording, I think sending out an all call that we were having a meeting that would, it's open to the public, that just read the resolution, I think that that wouldn't have been an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=392.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just wanted to share that with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=394.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=398.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=404.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council Adam, did you forward this to everybody?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=843.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that the word transparent gets thrown around, Ted, and I hate for you to get dragged into this, but you weren't part of any financial task force for the override, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=856.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I was not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=856.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=859.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Normally, when communities put this into place,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=863.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm told from different communities, different assessors, finance directors, that they usually line this up prior to any budget meetings, so we can help our most vulnerable people in our community understand what any impact it would make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=878.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So having this calculation that you're doing for us, and thank you so much for doing it, because I know there were so many questions with the calculations that have been public on the side that you had nothing to do with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=888.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it came out of a state website, but it didn't truly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=894.108s">[Scarpelli]</a>: calculate the newer assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=896.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's correct, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=898.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yep, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=898.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we look at this and now we're doing it on the 11th hour, the question was normally in your experience, other professionals in your field, this is done usually during budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=913.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can prepare our residents that if there was an increase of 373 median price,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=922.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're prepared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=923.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it sounds minimal to some people because it's only, that's all we keep hearing, it's only, but is it odd that we're doing this so late?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=945.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=947.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=950.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any other questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1135.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1136.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With just a couple more questions, I know that you mentioned that this doesn't have any impact on question six, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1143.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not in fiscal year 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1145.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because it's not enough time to put everything in, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1148.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know the actual numbers, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1155.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, but we still don't know how much for question six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1158.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's an open-ended, as it said in the question, there's nothing there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1169.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1170.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I realize the exemptions are great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1173.424s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but I know that there are options when you do this ahead of time is to really prepare your seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1179.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know the exemptions sound good, but when you read them and you talk to actual people, there are a lot of senior citizens that really don't fit in that category.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1187.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there are no other options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1190.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know the buzzwords easy to say, we do have exemptions, but when you put it apples to apples and you sit with the senior citizen and you go through their situation, I'm sure you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1200.171s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mrs. Jones bought her house with her husband 55 years ago for 50,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1204.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now the house is appraised at a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1208.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, it really doesn't help what we're offering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1211.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's a funny number and there could be something done more if we had time for an exemption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1218.621s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1219.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that if we had time, this is something we could petition to see if we can really truly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1224.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: support our senior citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1226.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that must be said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1227.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think the, the last piece to this, I think that when they look at this and because one question I have Ted is that a lot of people have asked, not just seniors, um, that the, this is like a one time tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1240.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1241.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you see that 4% above your two and a half percent increase, that's going to be compounded year after year after year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1249.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't something that's going to go away like debt exclusion, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1257.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, so that'll grow forever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1259.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think the other piece that people have to understand too, and it's a tough office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1264.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just, when you hear the misconceptions, I just need your input to educate our residents and understanding that, again, I believe the mayor said her house is only $13.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1275.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Some others here said their house is $40 a month or whatever, and we can handle that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1281.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That might be the first year, but again, we were told, I think someone from your office emailed us and said that we'll be reassessing again in 2025 for 2026 using the data for 2023, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1310.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1311.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1312.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for helping with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1313.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it increases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1313.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1314.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, when this tax goes in, it's now assessed again, the homes will be assessed again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1323.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, but we're seeing that most assessments, because I could tell you, I'm dealing with my own family members that are looking at a $400 increase per month for his new assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1336.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1337.183s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that what people also have to understand is that it's not just the home tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1342.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've seen their cars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1347.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Motor vehicle excise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1348.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Vehicle excise tax is going to go up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1350.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're going to see the CPA tax because your homes are going to be assessed higher now, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1354.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now the CPA tax will also be taxed higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1357.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're going to see that a little bit higher, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1360.18s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, that's yeah, that's generally correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1366.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1367.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what you're seeing is, it's not just it's not just an override tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1374.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's an override tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1375.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's compounded year after year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1377.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a tax that increases in the CPA as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1380.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the excise tax that increases as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1383.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's so much more than just 13.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1385.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's my point I'm trying to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1387.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's easy to look at a site that wasn't put forth by our office because we know that although it's correct, the numbers that my colleagues did put out there on a page, it does give the numbers that are true and factual, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1403.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That didn't include the assessments that residents had, and I'll use my brother's example, because his house was appraised at, on the calculations, at $800,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1413.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: His house is now appraised at $1.2 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1415.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's why we're seeing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1417.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's not odd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1419.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is family-owned homes that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1422.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we passed on to generation to generation, just like most people in this room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1426.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1427.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know I'm monopolizing the time because I think it's important, because these are the questions the people that are sitting in this in this room right now and their friends have contacted me and said, we're very confused, Mr. Scappelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1438.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because even something simple as, Mr. Scarpelli, why are we fighting for $7.5 million for a new high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1445.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm like, no, no, this has nothing to do with the new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1447.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1448.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And people understanding that, well, this is a fight between schools and kids and senior citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1455.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not true at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1456.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just want to make sure all the information's out so every resident understands the impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1462.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that, and we could talk about solutions as we go, because there are solutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1466.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were solutions back in April, but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1593.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is the microphone on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1597.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Andrew, is the mic, turn the mic down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2045.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let me start off by first saying that unfortunately this administration has divided this community for the children in the schools and the seniors or the homeowners or renters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2057.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I say shame on this administration, shame on this council, shame on the financial task force, because the bottom line is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2065.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This group knew that we were heading in some tough waters back in June 20th of 2023.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2072.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you could see that in a city council budget meeting when council beers met with the mayor behind closed doors to set up some sort of deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2081.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't know what that deal was, but they created a financial task force and that financial task force put together a plan of an override without anybody's knowledge, anybody's input or any,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2094.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or any community participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2097.747s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are no issues with our school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2101.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a fair tactic and fair tactic only for the fact that we should remember this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2107.29s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Back in April, back in May, back in June, when the city had $25 million in free cash, it was my responsibility to bring forth that we take that $5 million<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2119.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: levy that budget, make sure there were no cuts, understand the process, and then move forward to see if we truly need an override, which I never said that should never be an option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2130.832s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But to hear parents and teachers and friends and family say, George, explain this to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2138.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Villes knew that this was gonna be a devastating situation, but it could have been solved and still could be solved with free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2147.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have plenty of free cash in the system not to turn the city upside down or divide the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2153.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, remember, I'll leave you with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2156.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're asking for in the budget<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2159.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in this override doesn't mean you'll get exactly what you think you're gonna get.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2165.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because all these cuts were made to set up this override as a fair tactic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2169.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2169.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2170.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli is not against the children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2173.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just hope that people understand that this could be soft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2178.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2530.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2532.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think I heard some similar situations with, I know what the assessor came up and gave us medium price homes, but we're seeing real people have told me that this is what we're seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2544.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're seeing the increase close to $60,000, most homes that you're seeing an increase at a higher percentage rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2551.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, on top of all of what we talked about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2554.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with this, so it's not the $13 a month, the $40 a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2557.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the pieces that this gentleman just said is the understanding that I never thought that our home insurance now will now increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2568.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, this isn't them against us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2572.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is understanding that we have viable options right now to fix this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2579.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with free cash and then work together to see how we can have an open process to really include all the stakeholders to make sure that, uh, that no one is hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2590.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2917.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2918.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, I think my council is not understanding the free cash should be used now to fix a problem now, which we have, and I appreciate the clarification it's only $3 million accounts accounting and just said to fix the school budget, but the key issue isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2933.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: isn't the process of getting this fixed now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2936.745s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The problem that we've had, and we could use the pandemic and use the pandemic over and over again, but what neighboring communities are doing during the pandemic with the infrastructure money that was given through ARPA, that wasn't intended for, for the roads and sidewalks that you're asking for right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2951.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our mayor didn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2952.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our mayor had to balance our budget through ESSER and ARPA funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2957.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the easy way out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2958.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's like paying your mortgage with a credit card.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2961.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll tell you why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2962.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2963.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody hasn't said it, but the difference between why we're here and we're in trouble is because of new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2970.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: New growth is what pushes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2973.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: our value, our income up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2975.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It gives us more tax base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2977.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It brings more money so we can do all the things we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2980.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This mayor has done nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2982.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't had shovel in the ground in five and a half years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2985.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're talking about, I know my council friends have gone out and told people that Massachusetts is the number one, Medford is the number one community new growth in permitting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2995.47s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Wrong, I sat with the commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2997.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Permitting their fine, the biggest concerns we're having, look at the process that she lost fighting 40B projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3005.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One project alone was $3 to $5 million in permits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3010.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then an additional $7 to $9 million that would have come in as new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3015.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one job that she fought in court, lost and appealed it, and this group had to leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3021.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The problem isn't our tax base, because our assessments are up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3025.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're paying more than anybody else in neighboring communities because our assessments are so high.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3031.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will share my last point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3034.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Neighbor communities per child, Malden, Arlington, Winchester, between 15 and 17,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3042.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Medford, we pay $22,000 per student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3045.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it a management issue or is it really we don't have enough money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3049.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Think about it because it's public. $22,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3530.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I can, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3532.456s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3532.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, this financial task force was put together without any individual involved in that comment that a young lady put forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3542.981s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This was done in a bubble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3544.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This was done behind closed doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3546.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It wasn't planned to educate our seniors, educate our residents, educate our renters, educate our landlords, so they could prepare themselves for what's being asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3557.048s">[Scarpelli]</a>: within a vote that was presented, a discussion was presented on a Thursday, voted on a Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3564.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: not one community meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3565.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as a matter of fact, I will share this with everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3569.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was a FOIA request put out by a resident that asked a simple question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3575.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They asked for all of the information, minutes for the meetings, any information, letters, any emails, any text messages, with this financial task force, with any building or any entity within the city to figure out if this is needed or how it will be used and how it can work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3593.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 150 pages later, all the information that was in that FOIA request were information about when we can meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3600.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nothing that's solid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3602.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would also share with these parents that are so concerned about what's happening, we were<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3608.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: saw the information back from the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3612.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The school department communications director answered by saying, thank you for the FOIA request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3617.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We apologize for the tardy response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3620.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But after investigating, there was no school department employee or member of the school department involved in any financial task force<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3630.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: dealing with these overrides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3631.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what again, what we're saying is we don't know if an override is needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3636.331s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know one thing, we know we could fix this issue right now with free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3641.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So our students and teachers and families are fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3644.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we go back to the drawing board as a community together to see what we really need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3650.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If the mayor isn't gonna put new growth out there, she's not gonna work to bring in creatively, bring in funding for the city, then maybe we can look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4026.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Financial director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4203.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure, let me help you, Mr. Jones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4206.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This financial task force was a farce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4208.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was a lack of transparency throughout.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4211.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you speak on, I speak to this in where I worked in 2009.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4216.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we met in a possible override in a neighboring community, we talked about three things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4221.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was how do we get here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4223.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What do we do to fix it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4224.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And how does this happen again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4226.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And those people brought in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4228.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: mines from Tufts, Harvard, MIT, Medford, not one person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4233.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They brought in their financial team, Medford, not one person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4237.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They had their assessor set the rate so people can understand, assessor was never involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4241.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you look at how this was done, this was done in a bubble, this was presented on a Thursday, and then voted for in the budget meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4249.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you look at the budget meetings, when I brought up the way to fix it, which is free cash, and I'll disagree with my fellow Councilor, because she's wrong 1,000%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4261.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Free cash for divisional local services, it's not recommended, but not against the law to use free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4269.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 3 to 5% annual budget, FY24 method generated $9 million to add to a $25 million estimate, which means the city had around 16% of free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4281.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, the solution was very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4284.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's have this financial task force present this to the community, because that's what I asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4289.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I asked my colleagues, when are we going to present what the findings were?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4293.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were no findings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4294.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was just given, we're going to do an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4296.42s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People came up, shared, the mayor was happy, and it was done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4299.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The truth of the matter is, you're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4302.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was no one involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4304.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This was done in a bubble to scare people, to come out and say, the schools, the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4310.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll say it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4311.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said this in April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4312.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said it in May.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4312.714s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll say it today again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4314.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We might need an override, but if we do it right, with open and transparent government, we could do something great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4321.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now remember, with one override in every other community, there's two, three to follow, and don't forget, this council's gonna ask for a 200 to $400 million debt exclusion from New High School, which we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4332.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4334.954s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please don't be confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4336.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not telling you the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4337.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4339.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4854.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Another fair tactic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4855.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So people should understand the mayor came out just the other day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4858.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had 34 million, 34.5 million as of July 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4863.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor, just so you know, what free cash is, it's your money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4866.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we say we're going to fund 50 teachers and we don't pay those 50 teachers because they don't hire them, that money goes into free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4875.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's our money, that's your tax money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4877.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and then it could be used for what it needs to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4879.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's truly mismanagement of funds from our leadership team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4884.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's taking what we sign off on our budget and not use correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4889.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what we have right now, I believe I've said this, Councilor Leming said it over and over again, I'm not saying use free cash every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4897.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a deficit right now, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4900.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we can correct right now and not put the schools and kids and teachers in fear and say let's level fund that budget using one time free cash one time and then look into what options we have later but let's listen to the mayor what she said 34.5 million<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4916.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now she knows the override's gonna be a fight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4918.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What does she do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4919.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Boom, she starts putting all these different monies in different accounts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4923.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So from her words exactly in her video the other day, we have 18.5 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4928.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With that said, we can still take funding to level the school budget and still have 14, $15 million, which still leaves enough in there that would appease any bond rating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4940.553s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, let's not get scared because that's a scare tactic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4944.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's see the bond rating so we can move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4946.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, when we look at this situation, council, different communities, free cash, Arlington is 18 million, Framingham 14 million, bigger budget, Quincy 1.2 million, bigger budget, Andover 14 million, Newton, these communities are bigger than ours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4964.739s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have this budget, they function with lower funding and free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4971.183s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So understand this, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4972.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can do this one-time cost to save the fare from our schools, take care of our seniors, our renters, our homeowners, so we can stop the fare in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4982.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please, vote no on these overrides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4987.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was done in a bubble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4988.613s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It wasn't transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5219.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's 18.5 left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5226.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's called scare tactics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5438.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, Mr. Giglio, these are all scare tactics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5443.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, the financial task force didn't have the FOIA requests that shows that there were no documentations, no minutes, no information given.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5453.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We heard the assessor, we know all the major parties, the school department, the assessor, the finance director, weren't involved in these issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5462.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is, it's not a lie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5464.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just said it, you heard it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5466.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Put 30 seconds back on for interrupting me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5468.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have the understanding that the sky is falling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5474.177s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All of these projects that we need to fix, we need to fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5477.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In normal communities, what we do is we bond these projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5481.079s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we look at situations that we talked about earlier, when it's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5486.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're trying, what we're seeing here right now, Mr. Joyo, it's the underfunding of local revenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5496.209s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One second, I'll just, it's the focus of what we're seeing that our community has done for years here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5502.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's show lower meals tax and hotel tax and excise tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5507.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So then when it comes higher, you can put that and use it for whatever you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5511.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let that be known, the understanding what you're asking for, there are no numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5515.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The problem we hear right now, why the city's divided, why our seniors are scared, why our landlords are scared, why our homeowners and renters are afraid right now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5523.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why our students and parents and teachers are afraid is because this group did something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5529.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They put it out there without any true information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5531.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we don't know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5533.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't been educated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5534.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why there's so much fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5536.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The firefighters aren't supporting a $30 million fire station, because again, there was no transparency there when it came to the final decision that had to be made for 30.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5544.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they've decided to go public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5546.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They decided to go public to say, let's not hurt our taxpayers with whatever, how many it's going to be, because we don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5553.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It could be a $50 million fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5555.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the design was never put forth to the firefighters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5559.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you say totality, six, seven, and eight, we haven't been involved, Mr. Gileo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5564.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are no numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5565.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There is no information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5566.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because this group did it in the financial task force that presented it on a Thursday, voted on it on a Tuesday, and then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5574.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We find $9 million in free cash after that, that the man knew was certified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5583.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, can I say one more thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5685.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We wouldn't know that because it's literally in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6037.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With the fair tactics, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6038.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the schools, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6041.33s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's Councilor Leming said it over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6044.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, we haven't done it, so let's do it, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6047.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just because we haven't done it, let's do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6049.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now the roads, now we hear the schools were built bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6054.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's all fair, this is all fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6056.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But here's the thing, we're not saying that, let's not look at this properly and do it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6064.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6065.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're doing it in a bubble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6067.051s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're doing it so privately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6068.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're doing it where it's gonna hurt so many people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6072.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, the finger-pointing between teachers and finger-pointing between seniors and kids, and it's a shame what you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6082.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can correct this right now with the free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6085.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No matter what they say, the truth of the matter is we have free cash to make sure that seven and eight are correctable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6092.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know question six is correctable by listening to our firefighters, who will tell you straightforward that the mayor's not telling the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6102.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What they're building there is insufficient, and it's going to put us 30 years behind in five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6108.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please understand this, Mr. Gervino, when you say all this information and how it gets out, we haven't done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6114.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even though councils want to say we did, we haven't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6117.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't prepared our seniors for what's going to happen on January 1st of 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6122.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Once the new assessment, once the new tax bills come out, we haven't done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6126.289s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't prepared up our, our, our landlords to how they're going to handle single parent, uh, renters in their home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6132.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't prepared our renters when increase goes up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6135.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here's another one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6136.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Somebody called me when I put a post out about a woman that called me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6140.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She has two children, and the landlord said, I'm not going to hit you with the assessment raise, but I'm going to be honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6147.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I got to tell you, I'm going to have to raise your rent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6151.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And someone asked me, well, are you going to support rent control?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6154.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, there's another wrong that doesn't make a right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6157.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, there's a system in place with this group that's telling you what you should do out of fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6163.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please, again, we have the funds to fix it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6167.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No matter what they're saying, it's absolutely above board to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6172.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand it was done with mismanagement throughout the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6177.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6514.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6524.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It goes into general fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6527.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6528.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It goes into general fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6529.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And by law, you're supposed to take the letter of what the questions are and use those funding as closely as you can to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6538.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the questions as they're read are very vague.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6542.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it really doesn't mean it's gonna go directly to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6546.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It could be portions of that or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6548.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I'll bring us back to the budget meeting when school committee member Jenny Graham was asked a question, if we were given $5 million, would everybody go back to those positions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6559.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the answer was yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6561.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The next evening, the school's financial director and the school superintendent, when I asked that question from the evening before, she said, absolutely not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6571.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The money would go back into their fund and they would distribute it to what they think is best for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6577.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's a little, it's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6580.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll give you an example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6581.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talk about all these different cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6583.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't filled, I believe now 29 teachers in the Medford public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6589.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's funding we haven't, we paid for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6591.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have so many dire issues, so many, the fiscal crisis we've been hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6597.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same breath, we're asking to bring in shiny new programs that are new, that are costing the school department $200,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6606.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're talking about a city council that during this financial crisis talked about, did what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6612.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We found $9 million of free cash when they looked at the override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6616.035s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6617.656s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They voted themselves a raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6619.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the SIKU committee now goes from $10,000 to $12,000 up to $22,000, $24,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6626.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor gets an increase three times, three different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6630.436s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I implore all of you who are open-minded thinkers, are you sure we're in a fiscal crisis or are we in a problem with this fiscal mismanagement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6726.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6951.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Councilor Bielsa, in question six, I think we have a firefighters union here that have been involved in the negotiation because there is no limit on question six, truly is no limit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6962.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6964.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, there isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6965.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's wide open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6965.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that if we can maybe have a fire fighters that have been working on this, just to give us an idea of what the process was, the beginning, what we were looking at for a number and how, how much it's dropped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6978.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can understand truly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6984.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=6985.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm sorry, hopefully the firefighters can have an opportunity to express why they want to vote no on this debt exclusion because I think what you asked, there is such fluctuation and what's true, what they needed and what was agreed upon<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7003.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: before the mayor became very angry with the firefighters and then started cutting and cutting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7008.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now we're left with an inferior product that our firemen and women, firefighter men and women said over and over again, that please do not hurt the residents of this community with an inferior station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7020.288s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Don't do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7021.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Wait, maybe down the line, we could rethink this and refocus on what we could do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7025.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But for now, we're saying, let's not hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7028.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So here we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7028.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have teachers that are saying, let's not hurt our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7031.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have firefighters saying, let's not hurt the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7034.929s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The questions you're asking should have been out there for you, Joan, months and months ago, so you could truly understand the impact that you're going to feel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7043.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, this is where we talk about the lack of transparency and why this should be taken off the table and people should vote no, because the bottom line is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7053.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The fear of children, that should be fixed with the $3 million from free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7057.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor said it, we have 18.5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7059.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We could still take 3 million out and do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7061.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll still have enough to keep our bond rating up and look to bond other projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7066.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or maybe we sit together again as a true financial working group, a task force, and say, how do we do this together as a community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7074.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're not gonna look later because there's no guarantees that there won't be another override next year, I promise you that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7080.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because every other community that's gone that way have asked for two and three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7626.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7629.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Isn't this a total microcosm of what we're saying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7633.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what 678 is about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7635.701s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's so much confusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7638.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First of all, we have to understand the feasibility study that was done is what gets us the funding for through procurement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7645.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we know the numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7647.11s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When my fellow council said that this is a city building and firefighters, I don't know what the comment was, that is so irresponsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7654.437s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To understand that this fire department's gonna stand up and say, no, we don't want a new headquarters because it's insufficient and it will hurt our community funding-wise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7665.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we say the needs of the community, we mean proper safe staffing and department and ability to add technical rescue specialist services to our emergency response, which will bring better services to the citizens in every call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7678.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's wrong what they're asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7679.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're asking for a fire stations adequate to help our community grow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7685.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The proposed design does not adequately address the health and safety issues of the fire service regarding cancer exposure mitigations, the privacy concerns which have never been addressed properly by our department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7697.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Adults deserve privacy regardless of the gender.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7700.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't an issue which is female and men.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7703.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you understand the design that was presented has firefighters after a fire showering downstairs<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7709.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: walking upstairs in a towel or a bathrobe, walking down a community hallway to get to their quarters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7716.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: By the way, their quarters did not consist of a locker room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7721.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what we're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7722.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are issues that I can't even believe that we would entertain this with so many questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7728.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is how six, seven, and eight were all done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7730.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They were all done in a bubble that we're supposedly battled over on social media by a leader of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7739.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have the former fire chief here, we have the leaders of our fire department that have openly said, we don't want to hurt our citizenry and putting $30 million, let alone $3 into this because we don't know what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8151.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate my fellow Councilor being in my mind to understand what my plan was, was to get the superintendent to say something she didn't wanna say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8162.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I appreciate the resident who put all of the meetings out on social media because you could say whatever you want about George Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8174.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You could say that he's a liar, but when there are video and documentations with it, simple question to the superintendent was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8182.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Will this money, will it be made whole like Councilor, School Committee Woman Graham mentioned?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8187.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Her simple answer was no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8189.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wasn't trying to have her say anything any different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8191.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as a matter of fact, what we're seeing in the school system after that vote, there were many teachers and many programs that were dismissed and cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8200.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had the band leader who left right away because there were promised things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8204.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had, we had to believe a $200,000 line put in place for City Year, which is a great program,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8210.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a great program, but when you have so many fiscal crises in the city, why are we funding something that's just a shiny nickel right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8217.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many issues with this, my friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8220.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I implore you just to listen to the common sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8224.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Listen to the understanding that you can use free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8227.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a former teacher, and a parent of public school kids, and a coach, I understand, I lived it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8235.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I lived the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8237.981s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but I also understand and how to move forward without hurting our whole community or without dividing our whole community, because this is what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8247.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These override questions are hurting our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8250.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have the information that's out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8253.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not spelled out correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8255.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't truly know, although like Councilor Kelly had said, yeah, it goes to the general fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8260.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know where that money's going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8263.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have teachers positions open with money in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8265.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Remember, there's a lot of money that hasn't been used to date that we can still use, but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8537.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, we went over this again, just to reiterate to people that are new to the room, $37, that's all it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8544.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Coming from people that truly don't understand the impact, because a lot of people here, imagine just $37 a month, what that would do to people sitting in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8552.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Imagine the impact, because that's been overlooked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8555.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but it's not 37.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8556.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about the CPA increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8558.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about the assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8560.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about the excise tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8562.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8563.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not 37.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8563.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The dialogue of fear spins it easily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8567.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, again, I'm gonna say this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8569.89s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The dialogue of fear, we talked about busing now, lead in the water, teacher cuts, roads and sidewalks, because $500,000 is gonna fix road and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8580.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the most important thing I wanna talk about is what's happening in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8584.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if you watch what's happening in social media, the teachers union, the MTA, has never ever, as one person that was on the negotiating team and a former member, has never ever<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8599.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: ruled on or endorsed a candidate or a question, because we knew as union members that our impact's not gonna hurt just, it's not gonna help us, but it's gonna hurt other unions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8611.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they did the right thing by staying neutral.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8616.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And maybe they believe in it, maybe they don't, but they said, let's be, let's stay neutral.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8620.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And shame on this community that have turned their backs on teachers saying, the comments I've been seeing, like this is the teacher's fault?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8628.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't the teacher's fault, this is the administration's fault to set up this fear tactic and set up this negativity to divide us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8636.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's dividing our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8639.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Listen, I want everything we can get for our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8642.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want everything we need for our students and parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8646.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I want everything we need for our firefighters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8649.52s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there's options with new growth as we come down the line, but we can correct it right now without hurting renters, landlords, senior citizens, our people that are most vulnerable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8659.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can use that free cash, make it whole and move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8665.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I implore you, please, think about what you've been hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8669.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's concrete, common sense information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8672.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9184.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, Councilor, to clarify a little something, I think that what I've heard from residents is the chronic misrepresentation and the lack of true transparency<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9198.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is what causes the community to distrust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9203.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what we're seeing right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9205.304s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's truly what we're seeing right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9207.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you hear and see how we got to this point, this is what caused it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9214.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The misinformation, the confusion, the uncertainty for the people that are most vulnerable, our children, our seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9226.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the issue that we should be focusing on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9229.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and thinking that an override is the answer, or, ready for this one, $500,000 are gonna fix our streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9237.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Come on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9239.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So let's look at, now I've heard that 20 times tonight, that $500,000 is gonna fix our streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9244.514s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's look at the big picture of what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9246.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: DPW, the mayor is firing DPW workers hand over fist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9252.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have equipment at DPW that we have members that haven't been trained because they don't know how to be trained on new equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9261.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a mayor that's spending so much money on legal fees and legal settlements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9269.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're using, the mismanagement of funds in this community has hurt us to the point that here we are, that some council is saying, hey, since we haven't done it ever, let's do it, which is wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9283.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I'd love to see us do this the right way from the schools with free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9290.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's go to the table and see what we truly need with a true financial team open to the public that it's shared with everybody's input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9299.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9456.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't understand her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9457.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't hear her question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9466.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, it's very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9467.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll say it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9468.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that when we sat and talked at the meeting in April, May, and June, I came forth with the proposal of a resolution of using free cash of the $25 million that we had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9483.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe it was Councilor, when I brought it forth, it was Councilor Leming that used Rule 21, which froze<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9491.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the future discussions of that proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9494.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then as it went through and you could see in the videos, as we went through that process, they kept using tactics where we couldn't speak or have open forums before we went to a vote in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9506.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, these are issues that when I say<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9511.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what we need to eliminate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9512.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to sit together as a community and say, okay, what do we work with the state and work with our assessor and say, hey, let's understand the impact at an early enough stage so we can be prepared for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9524.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's see if we can look at true exemptions that would help our landlords or senior citizens<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9529.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or our most vulnerable community members, then let's look at it and say, what do we really need and make sure that our children in our schools have everything that they're asking for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9539.373s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that with that process being open, I don't think we wouldn't be able to deny anything, but the way the process has come out and the way that's been spun saying, Councilor Scarpelling wants no because he doesn't want that, that's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9555.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The truth of the matter is the way this process has gone about from 2023 in June till today has been a total farce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9563.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's been a nightmare.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9564.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's been disingenuine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9566.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this council can say what they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9568.839s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These fair tactics are out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9570.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've heard them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9571.52s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not making it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9572.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've heard them all say it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9574.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: whether it's whether it's whether it's streets falling in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9578.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, even the mayor said the other day was sitting on a 200 million dollar time bomb called our water system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9584.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9585.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, if we did our job with ARPA, that's what that money was made for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9590.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not to save your key, sir, because you had no new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9593.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10069.855s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let me say it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10070.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10071.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This councilor has not said once that we should use free cash year after year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10076.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I said right now is eliminate the fear for our senior citizens, our children, our teachers for one time to level fund this and look at other options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10087.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what I said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10087.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know where this keeps coming back and forth and understand an override<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10094.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was said by another financial director in another community, he said to me, George, remember, using an override to do what you're trying to do in Medford, it's like using your credit card to pay for your mortgage or pay for your rent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10105.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's just not feasible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10107.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not a right way to go through the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10109.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We look at the different situations that we talk about and we said, okay, you know, Medford has drastically underfunded so many processes when you look at our receipts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10122.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're seeing that right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10123.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We see that our circuit breaker has increased.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10128.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've seen that we use the Fair Amendment Act for Chapter 70, our increase of $4 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10136.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There is a lot that's out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10138.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a lot of money in the city that we're not using correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10144.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have seen it over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10145.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've talked about, just to have the fact that you have $9 million of free cash at the end of the year, your budget season, to get certified, that just speaks volumes of mismanagement of fiscal funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10159.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Remember, when you sit there and you set that budget, that budget is set, let's say 100 million, and then you only spend 90 million, that means you didn't do something right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10173.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That means you didn't use that money appropriately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10176.673s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's the city's taxpayers' money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10180.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when I say free cash, of course it's not free.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10183.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's our money that we've already paid the year before to balance our budget, to make our city run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10226.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Simon, thank you for coming up tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10229.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm so impressed with you coming to this podium, because there are so many scaredy cat adults, but you have the guts to come up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10235.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I applaud you for that, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10237.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I have family members that might be your teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10241.575s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have children that went through the schools just like you did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10245.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know it's scary right now, because you're listening to grownups talk about, we're gonna cut positions, we're gonna hurt teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10252.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not the intent, my friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10254.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a solution that's easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10257.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can use money that the city has saved, that can fix it right now, instead of going to a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10263.096s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's something that Mr. Scarpelli asked for years, months and months ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10267.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when you come to this point, my friend, you have to understand, we wanna make sure that every single one of your teachers are back next year, because you know why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10276.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You deserve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10278.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for coming up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10950.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10952.01s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To your point, Mr. Rodriguez, I think that this is why question eight, again, this is why these questions are so vague, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10959.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That people are confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10960.885s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because the determination of this $4 million is so we can align the vocational school building with the high school building so we can increase the day, so we can provide programming for both levels, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10974.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So here's something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10977.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It hasn't been negotiated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10978.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It hasn't been discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10980.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So where is the money gonna go when it's not even entertained?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10986.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are the questions people have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10988.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The question that's $4 million, the state expert and former superintendent of Medford, Roy Belson, stated, if during negotiations, that's what we're looking for is to line those bells, then it's negotiations for the high school and vocational school teachers to increase their rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11013.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Realistically, you're looking at $600,000 when you're looking to do that group, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11018.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $4 million for what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11021.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like we've said, more arts programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11024.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have art programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11026.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The issue is aligning the bell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11028.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In programming, we have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11029.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just gotta line the bell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11032.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, it's so wide open to say $4 million to do arts and to align this process with the vocational school and the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11042.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is so vague, how can we even entertain voting on it when we know the ramifications to the rest of the community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11051.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11055.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: hear what was being said tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11057.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many open-ended questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11059.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many issues that people don't know how we got here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11063.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have FOIA requests that show that there was no proper discussions with school department members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11069.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When the school department isn't part of this financial task force for an override, and then a question like question eight comes up, it's so vague.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11077.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we sure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11078.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we sure that we need an override?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11184.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Where does it say that though?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11185.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because that's eloquent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11187.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You would have to look at it if it was presented that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11190.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, it wasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11191.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11192.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11737.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11741.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11743.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I missed most of the question, Bill, but again, like we're saying, we're hearing a systemic issue that's been happening for years, but the way the process, and I'll say again, the way the process has come forth, the way the process has come full circle right now, it's putting so many people, so many residents in flux and fear, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11765.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's the biggest concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11767.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the way that we've moved forward, that this group has moved forward to present an out, that really isn't an out like they've said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11776.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not gonna really help, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11779.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know where the money's going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11780.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Things are still questioned for each question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11783.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not certainties, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11786.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've already heard from everybody that hasn't been part of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11790.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, why continue this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11794.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why keep moving forward and understanding that we're hurting real people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11797.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're hurting real residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11800.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I said, I like, again, I'm talking about the children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11803.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm talking about the seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11804.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm talking about our renters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11805.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm talking about our homeowners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11807.692s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're hurting a lot of people right now for something that quote unquote is so minimal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11814.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the truth of the matter is, this is so minimal and such cause such divide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11819.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're now seeing is, are we truly gonna look at the next question when we really need it properly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11825.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or are we gonna look at it with caution and saying, I'm definitely gonna stand against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11833.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll use a $200 million, $400 million high school down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11838.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Imagine if that process was done, how it would destroy homeowners right now, senior citizens, people on fixed incomes, it would destroy us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11847.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why this process has to be done in a better way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11849.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It shouldn't be done in a vacuum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11852.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11926.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, I think if I can, Mr. President, I think when we've heard parents of the fear, right, that we're going to cut, I believe one school can remember saying it was 55 to 65 teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11938.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then it was now 35 and the pain, the fear is going to be spread all over, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11945.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody's going to feel the pain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11947.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was the comment that's gone out publicly by that school committee remember.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11950.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11951.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think what you're saying to this is saying that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11955.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we gonna cut, a teacher's gonna be cut in January, January 2025, if the override fails in November?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11963.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a question, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11964.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11966.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know because in these questions, these override questions, you didn't say to cover the cost of 55 to 65 teachers that will be cut, not a question seven or question eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11977.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11979.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that again leads to another example of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11985.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we sure we know what we're voting on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11987.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And are we sure we need to move forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11991.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And was this transparent enough?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12003.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So clarity, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12004.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So clarity, everyone, where's Simon?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12007.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Your teachers aren't going to be cut this year, because that's the word going out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12011.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The word was at these meetings now, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12013.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They will not be cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12013.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There'll be no cuts until next fiscal year, next school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12017.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But next fiscal year, we'll have more money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12018.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Next school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12019.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12020.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It'll give us time, because we had an opportunity, Gaston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12023.539s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had an opportunity back in 2023, when we realized that we were using ARPA and ESSER funding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12031.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to balance a budget of operations which you shouldn't that we know that but this council voted on a backroom deal that that's what happened and then they've moved forward with this financial task force so here we are right now<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12042.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 1.7 so all right so this is where we are right now<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12047.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh I apologize... so this is... Thank you, I apologize<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12716.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12717.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First, let's start off by the teachers and compensation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12720.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A good way to make sure they go is scare them with layoffs<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12726.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when you have an avenue to save them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12729.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But with this question, the truth of the matter is, in most communities, it's growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12734.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Growth, growth, growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12736.096s">[Scarpelli]</a>: New growth, smart development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12737.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12739.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what happened in neighboring communities like Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12741.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: During the pandemic, what happened in Everett, what happened in Malden, you saw new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12747.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've heard my council colleagues say that it'll take us five to seven years to see that wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12751.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had three 40B projects that not only would bring in valuable funding through permits and fees, and then the new tax base, but also open up an opportunity for what we lack here is affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12768.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this mayor has voided that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12770.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So like I said, just one project, and I'll say it over and over again, because we've talked to the owner of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12776.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He put in a place for 40B projects, 400 units at the old gold gym site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12781.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $3 to $5 million just in permits would have come right to us, right away, $3 to $5 million for one project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12787.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then you would see an increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12789.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Once that's built, you would then have a tax base of more to $6 to $9 million coming in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12797.115s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now what you saw is the mayor fight that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12800.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: which is a 40B project, which you can't fight and win in court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12803.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know that by law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12804.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She takes it to court, they lost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12806.169s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then she brings it back and she appeals it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12810.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: While we're paying lawyers, we lose the appeal, but at the same time, we now have these developers that have walked away to Medford because now they're in Watertown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12819.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now they're in other neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12821.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this gentleman just lost $5 million by sitting on a property, hoping he could develop Medford the right way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12827.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The other piece we have right now, the mayor is, did everybody hear this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12830.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's an RFP for five spots in Method Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12834.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What's the plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12836.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12837.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is again, lack of transparency and openness in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12840.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13095.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, if I can, I think there's more involved here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13101.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that it's very clear and cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13103.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the communities can see that our firemen and women do not want this override or this debt exclusion because it hurts our citizenry because the design and the building that they're looking to build is not adequate for any of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13117.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We also have a firefighter standing in front of us that, so we all understand why we're in fiscal crisis, why we're in fiscal issues, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13127.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Firefighter Masolino wrote a grant for 11 firefighters<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13131.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: through FEMA, so the FEMA would pay these 11 firefighters for three years, as long as you didn't vary from those 11 firefighters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13142.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor came in and said, at the end, the only caveat is you have to sustain those 11 firefighters to be at minimal level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13150.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor came in and said, no, we'll only fund five or seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13154.247s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just by doing that, guess what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13156.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It voided the 11 firefighters that would have been paid for FEMA for three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13162.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, this council, the mayor had a outside member doing evaluation to come in, and we spent $10,000 to start with this firefighter evaluator to come in and look at the fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13177.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have yet to hear anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13179.272s">[Scarpelli]</a>: From what I hear, that person's been gone now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13181.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No report, no nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13183.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the problem we see, the mismanagement of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13186.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not that we don't have, in certain cases, enough funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13190.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's how you manage those funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13192.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I thank you for everything you do, and we should not vote support this override, because our firefighters are saying, let's not hurt our residents, especially if it's an inferior product.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13206.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We'll stay where we are, even though it's disgusting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13210.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14012.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, and I appreciate the question because I too have a stance on this and it's difficult when your kids are reading posts and saying, hey dad, why are they using you for supporting constituents and residents that feel like they're being not listened to, to racist or a member of KKK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14034.32s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's pretty sad, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14036.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you see these situations of division,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14039.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's because people feel they haven't been heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14043.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I welcome you to look at the videos from our meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14046.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had viable questions in our meetings, and this is where the division started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14050.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you try to bring these questions forward and this council actively shut you down, as a member of this community and a city councilor, to be disrespected like that, opened up so many people's eyes to say, is this something that's been, is it needed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14067.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because there's a group of people, my friend, that aren't being heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14071.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're afraid that no one's listening to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14075.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something that could be corrected, I've said this a thousand times, I never said I didn't want a debt exclusion, or the side, even the All-Method group saying that they didn't want a debt exclusion, all they're saying is, let's have a more open and transparent process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14087.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've heard so many questionable issues tonight, from the firefighters' designs, to question seven and eight, there's so many.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14094.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think the problem right now is you have six councils that really look at something and an issue and they band together, but they leave a whole demographic out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14102.917s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They can say the fluffy words to say that, well, it's divisive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14106.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're saying it's divisive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14107.021s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Words that some people use is divisive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14109.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The bottom line is if it's smell, if it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck, it's a duck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14114.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and people just watch and see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14116.705s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want division either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14118.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's too much division in this whole country, in this whole world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14121.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would love for us to sit together, but as a councilor, when you're trying to share an opinion for a group of constituents that feel that they're not being listened to, that they feel like they're not being listened to, then you bring that forward, and then they actively shut you down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14137.651s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They use council rules against you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14139.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They suspend council rules so you can't speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14142.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14144.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is why the division started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14146.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because people didn't feel like they were properly listened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14149.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They didn't feel like this financial task force was actually transparent and open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14152.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if they were, and the mayor presented all the facts, maybe we'd be in a different place right now, but we're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14160.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we made a lot of mistakes on many sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14989.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that when you left, no one could say this publicly, but we wanna thank you because we know how difficult your job is anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14995.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We understand becoming a chief is very difficult because you have been thrown into the realm of politics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15001.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's sad because I know who you are as a man and I know how much you love being a firefighter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15006.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'll be honest with you, I was sad to hear that you did step away because Medford is worse as a fire department because you're gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15014.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I wanna make sure publicly somebody said that to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15016.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know Danielle doesn't want to say it, but I've heard it over and over again through public, through social media, our leader of the community, through social media, bashing on you, bashing on other fire chiefs, saying it's all them, that they've been part of the design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15032.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I need to know, when you left, were our firefighters involved in that design that we have today?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15340.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15341.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, if I can, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15346.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Clarification, thank you with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15347.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I also know that from what I've heard, it's 1,000 square feet smaller.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15352.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think you want to talk about unity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15354.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You want to talk about doing something correct as a team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15356.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you're talking about firefighters, that their safety with carcinogens aren't being met, I think in unity, we should all say that we do not support this debt exclusion for a fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15367.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's inadequate for our men and women in the fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15370.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what I think we should say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15372.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You want to start in that process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15374.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15375.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But Chief, thank you so much for the clarity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=15377.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I apologize that our firefighters aren't being heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16519.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if I can, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16521.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So very simply put is, I've been saying this for months now, is that it's a one-time correction with the free cash to eliminate any fear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16532.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and disruption to our whole community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16536.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been saying for years that in the last five years, we've had zero new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16542.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you talk about new growth, that is the solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16546.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The solution to any community's investment in finances is their new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16552.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done nothing in the city of Medford to hang our hats on other than a beer hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16560.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't seen anything bring in true funding other than a beer haul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16566.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, I mean, I've been pretty consistent with what I've been saying, but although you don't wanna look at transparency, I think that's the major issue right now is because the word, the information is not getting out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16579.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're voting on something that we've shown so many different reasons why we shouldn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16585.088s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many open questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16586.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many people, actual people that are gonna get hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16591.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that to have a solution is very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16593.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's using free cash once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16596.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People keep saying that I'm saying that we do this all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16600.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We do this once because this community had over $35 million, over $34 million of free cash that we could have used and then sat together in an open process to see what we can do together as a total community to see what we needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16619.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16620.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, new growth and development is so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16625.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We look at the way that our budget was underfunded in certain aspects, but underappreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16633.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we have to look at so many different options in the future, but what we lacked and the reason why we're here is because our mayor and our administration use one-time funding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16647.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to carry her water for the last five and a half years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16652.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why we are where we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=808.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=810.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Larry Lepore,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=813.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: someone we should all celebrate to know and be honored that he was our friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=818.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's been a while since you take that ride down Main Street and you notice his car's gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=826.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At Alexander's, one of his favorite spots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=831.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or the knock on your door and just so he can pat my dog.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=835.512s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or sometimes he would sneak away because he knew Dina was coming with Biscotti.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=844.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he would always be so kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=847.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's what we hear over and over about Larry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=852.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He never let politics get in the way of anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=857.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was just such a good person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=859.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And even if you had a bad day, he'd tell you, he'd lend you that word that you're doing the job that people elected you to do and made you feel that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=874.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: whatever you felt in yourself that it was the right thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=878.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm going to miss him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=882.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm going to miss him so much because I think a lot of us, even though if you didn't know Larry long, it's amazing how you captured his spirit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=895.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Even a night like tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=898.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, he'd look at me and we'd make eye contact with some stupid comment I'd make and I'd feel, oh, I owe him something later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=907.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or when someone would come up and they'd say something silly and he'd look at me with this like, are you kidding me type of face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=915.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But he never did it with disrespect or without honor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=919.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was such a good person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=921.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know the cancer that he fought at the end was very tough, very painful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=929.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And my condolences to his family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=936.274s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2400.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have one councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2402.77s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know you said that if this job, from what I gather, if this, if we don't find a resolution, National Grid walks away and there is ramifications, like you said, could you explain that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2418.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If there is a power outage with this piece being, you know, non-functioning that, that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2425.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What part of the community is going to be affected if that's the case?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2460.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so hypothetically, if we don't move forward with this, there's a power outage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2467.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Parts of South Medford are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2485.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So with that situation, does that then facilitate an emergency service?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2490.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2496.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and then, if, Mr. O'Connor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2503.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What do we pay then?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2525.609s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and then the rule is still up for interpretation, still have to hop the car.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2531.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=587.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=588.336s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=590.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the hard work, but I think that one of the questions that I've been, um, that I've, I've received from the constituents is that when we wrote this RFP, we're getting to the point where, um, the question is down to a rise that is, is that we need to be answered is that when we wrote the RFP and we asked for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=610.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh, in this to be the that were awarded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=613.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We were talking about the process of going into the neighborhoods that our zoning changes would be affected so we can have our citizenry be part of that discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=624.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, are we planning on doing that before we go to a city council final vote as we move<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=631.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: forward because that's something that was um stressed pretty pretty strongly when we discussed it with the prior city council so uh again i appreciate the hard work but i've been waiting uh to ask this question for the simple fact that it's what was intended when we first started the process so thank you thank you so much Councilor i really appreciate that question um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=775.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor as a city council, I have a question and for you to deny that question for city staff is a serious issue, Madam Vice President, because I have a follow up to the question that you asked because I asked a specific question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=789.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The specific question I asked was when we asked to write the RFP and if I'll bring up the minutes, we will<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=796.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we asked that we were going to take this directly to the neighborhoods and have an open discussion in those neighborhoods with open dialogue and meetings to get everybody's input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=807.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not what you just said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=808.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, this council is working on the transparency factor of what you think is correct, not what we decided on as a council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=818.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So don't disrespect me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=821.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wouldn't do that to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=821.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've done it three times tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=823.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=825.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Look at the video.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=870.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Madam Vice President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=877.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=878.231s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that it's important as as make it make it to be clear that I've I've gone to listen to every meeting, gone to every meeting, and this is under the meeting preference that we're waiting on the process that was originally planned and the RFP that this will be taking to the communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=897.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You haven't answered that question yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=899.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We haven't talked about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=900.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You said that we've had open dialogue that we've done this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=903.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=904.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I want to make it clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=906.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This Councilor hasn't brought this forward because I've been waiting for the process to walk through to see when is the plan and to go into the neighborhoods because that was the original discussion, Madam Vice President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=917.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=918.579s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1269.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've talked to the election commissioners and they said that these rules are all posted<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1275.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: at City Hall and the election in the elections office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1277.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if anybody does need some clarity that the election office does have all this information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1283.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1731.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Would you like to read that first, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1930.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And thank you for Mrs. Tomaszczuk bringing forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1931.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know I've talked to a few of our friends in the audience and I think there was some confusion first that people seem to thought it was about the pop-up park, but it's not about the pop-up park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1943.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The issues and concerns are something that we'll hear again later on tonight is that the way we're doing business in Medford is that we're really not getting the community involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1955.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know they wanna say the community gets involved, but the truth of the matter is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1961.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let me ask our seniors if we know that we have valuable land here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1966.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And unfortunately, I think there has to be an understanding that we need some growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1972.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if there was a partnership where we brought the process to the seniors and said, this is how we're going to look at the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1982.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We wanna make sure that all of your concerns are taken care of and get your input so you can share what you're afraid of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1991.716s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and making sure that we fill those gaps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1994.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sure none of you have had that conversation with anybody from the city, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1997.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct me if I'm wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1999.202s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so this is what we're seeing right now in Medford, is that as we're going through our zoning changes, one thing we talked about was really going into the communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2009.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We put that in the RFP actually, about when we rezone, when we look at projects like this, we go into those communities, just like neighbor communities do when they do big projects like Assembly Row,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2019.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and they do big projects like Union Square in Somerville, they actually bring city staff to the neighborhood where people come out and talk to you and you can share your concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2029.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm hoping moving forward by coming to this podium, there is an issue, there is a concern, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2037.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not gonna say that we don't need new growth and development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2040.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not gonna say that, I won't lie to you and tell you that I don't think that we need to use these parcels<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2046.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to make a change to really invest in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2049.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same time, what we need is an understanding and a form of partnership where our seniors can say, okay, if you're going to take this lot, what lot are we going to build<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2064.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and to make sure that it's similar vicinity that our seniors can park and walk across the street or walk next door so we can accommodate all of the programs that you said are so important to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2076.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think moving forward, I think that we have a, you know, I hear you loud and clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2082.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I'm going to advocate to make sure that as we move forward, especially with this RFP and these five parcels I heard that I think it's three, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2090.379s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I also told there was maybe five that are coming down the line that it's going to encompass the whole square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2095.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're going to see drastic changes here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2098.526s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it seems like we're forgetting the most vulnerable people in our community, mostly our seniors, and saying, well, let's just move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2106.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm welcoming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2108.274s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll share my information, my phone number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2110.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you feel fear in any way, give me a call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2113.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let me at least try to be a voice as we go through this process, because unfortunately, it's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2119.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2119.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that it could happen with a partnership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2123.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So everybody's involved to make sure that all the concerns that you have are addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2129.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you're not going to sleep thinking, are we going to lose the grieving program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2132.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to lose the knitting program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2134.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to lose this program because there's nowhere to park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2137.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's going to be important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2138.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just want to share that with you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2141.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that from what I've talked to a few of the seniors offline, and I think after this conversation I shared with them, they felt a little bit better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2151.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that we really need a buy-in from the city administration to work with our seniors, not just bring you cookies and pizza on election week, but really sit down with you and say, hey, what do you really need?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2162.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And making sure that your needs are met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2164.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3221.474s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3221.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just just a point of information maybe some clarity for the planning department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3226.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the question that was reported back to me that part of the RP that the mentioned the mayor mentioned was that it was a looking at 40 spots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3236.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for the new developers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3237.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that doesn't even come close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3239.423s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think this is why having this conversation is a beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3243.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think it's before it gets too late because we're down the line with other projects in the city that our community hasn't been involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3252.514s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I say community, it's having those meetings at the senior center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3258.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when you set a vision of what you want this to look like, what you want Medford Square to look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3262.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is where you bring in the business community, because some business members that were at that chamber meeting, really, they weren't very excited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3269.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's some question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3270.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But that's why you have these meetings open to everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3273.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you sit there with all the department heads, your planning department, your recreation department, your fire department, your police department, because there's so many things that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3282.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when you look at development that have to be considered, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3286.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do we, if we build this many<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3288.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we bring in this many people, are we going to have the infrastructure DPW can carry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3293.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we build it, bring in this many people, are we going to have enough police?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3296.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we going to have fire?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3298.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's so many, so many, and I only speak on this on as, as, as person who does this as a department head in the past, I worked for municipality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3307.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we do is before, before the city came out and just started giving out RFPs and getting the idea of the developers, because that's the problem with Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3317.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we bring the developers in to get their idea first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3319.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Isn't that, that's a shame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3321.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the issue is in other communities what happens is you bring your stakeholders in first with the plans that were were derived that Medford has spent millions of dollars on that dust some of those off and say well these plans say this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3335.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So where do you feel and what do you fit?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3337.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the first thing we see is our senior citizens have already come out and said what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3340.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're scared that we're going to be overlooked and bypassed because one of the basic necessities we have is parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3348.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that could be something that you look at at a meeting like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3352.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm hoping that the mayor really, really readjust and understand the process when it comes to the December proposals that come in, that we reassess again and look at the true process of true development and true input from our community, where we bring the meeting to you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3370.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not somewhere that you have to find one, you have to find where this meeting is and then go out and look for it and then not have the proper people in that can answer the questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3378.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But neighboring communities, what they do is they bring everybody in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3381.947s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So every question is answered right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3384.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So then we could set up a comprehensive plan that involves all the stakeholders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3390.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, that means that not everybody's gonna be happy with some of the decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3395.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but at least they can look at outcomes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3397.157s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know one of the things we talked about in my neighboring community was it was affecting the process for one of our senior areas in Union Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3405.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So part of the deal was that we would have a shuttle system in place that would be built in with the developers that we don't need senior citizens who didn't need the parking in that area for it was identified for a small group, I think it was 50 people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3420.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they looked at how they would shuttle the seniors in, and that was part of the contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3426.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's being creative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3428.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, that's at least giving you an option to give you calm and understand that people are looking out for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3435.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because a friend that came up to the podium said that our seniors are afraid that we're being forgotten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3441.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3443.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've heard that in the last, especially three months in the process, we're seeing what's happening on election day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3449.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We hear you, at least I hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3451.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we need to really put our money where our mouth is and really start opening up the dialogue with the most vulnerable members of our community, unfortunately, which are our seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3460.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Councilor Bearsley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3512.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the concern with that response was that not everybody is getting informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3519.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what I'm hearing from everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3521.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You might just check a box and say, we're having a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3524.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, I understand the comprehensive plans that have been going on for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3526.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We spend millions of dollars on it, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3528.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what we're seeing, what I'm hearing, especially firsthand from our seniors, is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3533.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: people are getting surveyed that then they say there's a survey of people say they've been spoken to people said there were meetings, but no one really knows when it seems like just a certain group understands against this message, because the average person, and you can look at what we have here in the auditorium today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3549.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they're not getting the message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3550.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if that's the case, Council President, we need to do a better job as a community and a leadership in the city is to educate all of our members of our community so they can get involved with these processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=3562.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4591.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4591.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, President Council, let me bring this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4594.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because this is the outside the box thinking that we need to protect that most vulnerable, especially when you talk about the times we're in today so I and I think that Council saying is correct I think that what might help some people that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4606.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, there are some people out there that'll question everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4609.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think the city assessor could really support us by showing how the tax levy is, how many, if we looked at how many veterans needed the support and what that would look like and who would carry the brunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4625.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think if you asked nine out of 10 residents that we can support our seniors, I mean, our veterans,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4635.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and helping them through this process, I think that it would be supported wholeheartedly, but I think it would be good just to see that number, because I don't think it'd be drastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4646.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4808.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4810.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was informed that our, um, the consultant that this body approved its funding, um, has finished their assessment and has presented to the chief and his leadership team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4825.258s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one thing that I found, um, that really struck me is that back in September, um, maybe the fire, um, our partners from the method fight apartment can help us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4838.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4839.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had, I know the mayor spoke on a podcast that mentioned the consultant directly and stating some pretty damaging wordage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4852.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would imagine that that letter<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4855.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is public and is part of this body's purview to overview and use that input to help our residents, especially when they come up to Tuesday's meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4867.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know the Chief's here, and I know that President Marcellino's here from the Firefighters Union, and I know that, I believe the mayor used the consultant's words, she said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4879.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If she didn't fix the culture dysfunction with the fire department that someone could get hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4884.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's something she used to support her efforts, moving against anything to deal with the fire department but I think that that's something that is alarming to me when I heard it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4894.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4896.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the consultant is completed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4898.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One of the biggest issues that we're hearing right now and discrepancies that we're hearing from both the fire, um, firefighters themselves, the fire union who have come out publicly and chief Freeman, who was here the other day that spoke openly about the design of the fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4917.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4919.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know how people want to look at the situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4921.509s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it's one side or the other, I don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4923.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that there should be only one side, and that's what we need in our community for our fire station, the best design possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4930.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that I would imagine that, and correct me if I'm wrong, maybe Chief Evans can come up, that the pot of that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4939.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: discussion must have been around a new design of a headquarters and getting some information out to the public, whether it's a, I know we're very popular with press releases, but really sharing any information that's given through a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4955.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: third party per se.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4956.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not the yes group, it's not the no group, it's a third party that's come into the city and done an evaluation that the mayor has requested that this council has paid for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4965.941s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would hope that we can get that information out before the election on Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4970.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know a lot of people have already gone out and voted, but I think that understanding what a consultant might think of that design might play a huge factor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4978.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now again, if it's the fact that there isn't any information in those documents about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4985.169s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the design, then I stand corrected and we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4990.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think it would be interesting to see if that was part of that consultant's purview to share their opinion when it comes to our main street<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5001.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: fire department and it's designed for a new station because I know that a lot of people right now are in flux whether they're going to support it or not and if it's something that comes out and says no there are some design that he does support what the administration is saying that this is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5018.949s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All perfect and it's ready to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5020.531s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know the chief supported it through the letter that the mayor read in her blog or her report that it's definitely that he supports the design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5031.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that having a party that is an outside specialist, I'd like to see if maybe the chief or anybody from the union has heard anything that can help us get that word out to the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5047.692s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5090.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, it could be released, especially with the election coming up in November about support or not supporting the fire design of the project, that if the consultant had information that we can share before the election day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5133.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's nothing in the design that consultants about their thought of the design?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5142.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I don't know what I'm just saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5144.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If it's not, it's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5144.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm just saying that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5146.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what I would do if we can, um, as well as, uh, appreciate that, that eliminates any, um, any, any thought process of trying to answer some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5156.739s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that if we can, Mr. President, that we do motion that we have, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5162.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if the consultant can come out later on after this as soon as we can to really review all of the findings with this council and if it needs to be to go to executive session that we go to an executive session because I know we as a council had some questions about having the fire department and talking with them about some concerns and maybe opening up executive session for them as well so I would put that in a form of a motion and hopefully we can do that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5190.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: before before the new year if we can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5192.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5204.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now that the chief has answered that, that there's nothing in the report that, you know, I thought that that might be interesting to see if a third party had some initial thoughts on that in the report, but if they don't, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5217.16s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's now we know if they don't, if we could just rephrase that, Mr. President, that we call for a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5223.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: um a meeting uh before the new year it doesn't have to be right away now with the fire department and um the consultant to review their findings thank you got it so i would amend the resolution to um remove the question about the fire headquarters and then change it to requesting to attend a future council meeting to explain the findings perfect thank you mr president got it do you have that amendment mr clerk<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5609.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council Collins for leading our zoning team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5613.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that this is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5615.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: agreed 1000%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5617.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to move it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5618.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we've been looking, looking into this for so many years but I just again, I bring forth the understanding that of course we've had a lot of meetings, we can see that there's been plenty of meetings but one of the things that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5631.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we made sure with the past council that we really made sure that we tried to incorporate the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5639.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now you could say that we've had these meetings been open up to everybody and this is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5644.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not what we talked about when we started the RFP process back<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5648.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: back many many years ago the conversation really was and I hope there's still time to do this is bringing the meetings to those neighborhoods and getting the input from our citizenry and with a comprehensive plan together with all the departments together and getting the vision of what everybody wants to do and making sure that all of the needs are going to be met in that neighborhood<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5672.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I revert to the RFP that was written and the scope of work that it says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5681.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: public outreach the consultant will develop a public outreach strategy designed to inform the community stakeholders and the general public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5689.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The strategy and design was brought up into the fact that what we were doing in Somerville as a department leader that really shined the light and made everybody feel like stakeholders<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5704.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I remember these meetings specifically that we all understood and agreed that going into these meetings, sitting down as a team, looking to see what everybody wants in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5714.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we talked about my process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5716.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about how recreation played a process when we wanted to look at Union Square and how that process was derived and how it was built together with stakeholders at those meetings in their backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5728.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we've had a thousand meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5730.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that people have been informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5732.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but it's not what we asked for as a council a few years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5736.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what part of the RFP was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5738.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I'll state the comment that was made in a meeting when we were deciding this and we were talking about this in March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5746.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli said, he thinks the most important thing in the community's input is community-based meetings, meaning in that zoning community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5755.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, this is something that I'm making up because I wanna be negative or I don't wanna do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5761.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm gonna move forward with it, because I think we need to move forward with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5764.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But in the same vein, we have the whole community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5767.539s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been talking with the people from Salem Street, and they feel the same way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5772.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one's talked to them, no one sat with them in their backyard at the Roberts, like we did in Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5778.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We go right in their yard, go to the Roberts Elementary School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5781.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You bring the neighbors there and say, okay, this is a proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5783.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're looking to redevelop part of Salem Street to 12 stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5788.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, if you ask the people on Salem Street today, no one was really informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5792.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No one really understood the process and no different what we're hearing on Mr. Cav.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5796.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5799.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know we need this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5800.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know we need the reform.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5802.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've supported this from the get-go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5804.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we do need is the truth of what hasn't been done, and that's what was written in the RFP, to have community-based meetings to involve the areas that are being rezoned to get their input and make them feel like they're part of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5817.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not all of a sudden they come in and say, well, there's 12 stories coming up and we really weren't part of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5824.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, no, we've had 36 meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5825.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know we've had 36 meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5827.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I'm telling you again, when we talk about surveys, and I'll use Carr Park as an example, when they did Carr Park over, we talked to Alicia saying that everybody was surveyed in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5839.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I live a few streets away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5840.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I wasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5841.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I asked my neighbors, no, they weren't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5843.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're seeing the same thing as we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5845.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, this is the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5846.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we could still catch this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5849.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But all I implore to my council colleagues<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5853.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to do what was asked in the RFP and I'll make a motion to revisit or ask for the plan that associates must have because it's part of the scope of work of what they viewed envisioned of what the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5868.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the community outreaches because to me, we're not reaching them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5872.427s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, like I said, I'm going to support this because I think it needs to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5876.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But in the same vein, before it gets too into the process, we really need to start having these community meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5882.575s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We really need to start informing our residents more about being part of this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5888.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they're not shocked two years down the line when all of a sudden their neighborhood has changed so drastically that they can't live there anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5896.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6034.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for myself so I can share this with the community is what that breakdown really means for the community input one on ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6043.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, I think that that would be important to Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6045.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, um, I don't think it will be a concern or an issue or a violation to bring the meetings into neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6054.274s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've done this in the past many, many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6056.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, I think that that that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6059.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that wouldn't be a hindrance at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6061.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I appreciate the words, but again, I do think that we should do more, like you said, and maybe outreaching and doing something in their communities, in those neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6073.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7730.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hello?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7732.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it me you're looking for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7733.686s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can you hear that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7736.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Chief, I know that recently I saw, I think it was a Stoneham truck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7755.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's what's great with the fire department in your world that we can reach out to our brothers and sisters from neighboring communities to help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7762.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that my thing is that I know that as we look forward to the capital plan that the mayor put out, we know we have two trucks coming, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7772.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that there were questions last year that we wanted to order two more, but if we didn't do it a certain time, it would be,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7781.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: drastic, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7782.01s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what is I know the two are coming in 20 is it 2026?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7798.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so it looks like we need some band aids to get us through these first two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7803.687s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then I know that do you know when the plan is for the other two was part of our 14 plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7809.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7810.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, that if we can, Mr. President, as part of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7814.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We just get an update on the mayor's capital plan about the I know that we wanted to but waiting for two more fire trucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7821.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think because if we keep we keep band aiding and keep it'll be no different than what we're seeing with the streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7836.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's only so much bubble gum and duct tape that we can purchase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7840.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that these are serious issues and making sure our firefighters have, you know, it'd be funny if everybody jumps into Bobby's oil truck to go fight a fire because we don't have a truck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7853.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I think that I completely understand<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7859.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: where we're going with this and it's if it's needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7863.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand but I have other questions but I yield to my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8312.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8374.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Due to the situation with the override on November 5th, I would invoke rule 21<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8381.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to move this to the next meeting after the override for the fact that without understanding the true emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8398.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would invoke rule 21 and move this to the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8401.487s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8548.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8549.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8551.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can you define paper way so people can understand what that means, because a lot of people like where's paper way in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8558.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we can just explain that a little bit that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8635.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, that's out of necessity, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8637.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because of some structural issues to Joseph's way, is that what I'm?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8683.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I'm looking at it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8686.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It looks pretty dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8687.668s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=938.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: resolution stated that it go to governance committee to discuss COLA raises.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=945.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now it's that, so in essence, this is saying that the city council shouldn't be voting for their own raises and that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=954.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=955.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm just.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1027.617s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if I can, because I received numerous calls, as you can imagine, because the way it read really alarmed a lot of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1036.16s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This has been a very trying week, both on the national level and also in the local level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1043.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And part of the discussions and making sure that the residents know is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1049.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, after such a close vote and half of the community split over the override and so much contention still left in the community to divide the fact that we had elected officials, especially the mayor dancing in celebration that half of the community is going to be in pain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1066.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, to add this, the next day was so, you know, for the next meeting was very, very touching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1072.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1073.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just I don't know where this is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1075.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have our own ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1076.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have our own rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1078.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It seems like the way I read it is someone maybe talked to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1082.351s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Your friends might have talked to you and told you don't do this the day after an override vote because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1088.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this community needs a lot to heal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1091.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And in the process that we went through and the questions we had with the original raise, I don't even understand why this is on there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1097.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would imagine you should rule it out of order, Mr. President, just for the fact that, as you already stated, these are things that we've already had in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1105.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, as as the senior member of this council and understanding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1110.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know historically why people join this council in the past is really being part of the community and looking at this position as a full-time position should never be looked at a full-time not Medford maybe in a major city but in the city of Medford to even look at a salary adjustment in any way to move forward I think it's totally disingenuine especially the week that we had last week so I would um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1135.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My I will know anyway, but I would hope that this would be ruled out of order and disperse because this doesn't say anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1144.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It said something early that really riled the whole community up and then looking for a cola when we have we have departments that haven't gotten a raise in years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1155.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1155.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have city departments that go three years without raises or colds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1160.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that was something that just to let you know, this is what I'm saying this out loud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1164.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the people that are watching because they were very interested in what was being said tonight that to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1171.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to review this isn't, hopefully this isn't asking for any sort of Kohler adjustment like other communities or anything like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1180.59s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Until we take care of our own here, I think that we should stay away from this completely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1184.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Stay away from any money paper when it's talking about funding this council a penny more after fiscal crisis and what we went through on Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1192.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1602.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why would you say that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1603.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not part of any group, I'm a member of many groups, but to say that you use my name in that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1611.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can use the best metrics in so many different ways that this person did, and just embarrass my community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1624.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't send anything out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1626.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So don't use my name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1629.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Use my name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1631.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a meeting, tell them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1672.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The comments that have been said around this oval that we're talking about, these are conversations I've had with people that have reached out to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1680.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what was said, what was written in the original may be changed after someone woke up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1685.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But whereas the Medford School Committee recently went 24 years without a cost of living adjustment, COLA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1692.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now this starts to think, well, what does it say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1695.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're looking for COLA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1696.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are the questions they asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1698.792s">[Scarpelli]</a>: be it resolved that the governance committee take up the ordinance to disallow the city council from passing salary change to affected city officials, and to encourage the city council to consider regular color adjustments for elected officials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1710.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's exactly what it says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1713.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't say it wasn't for next year, but what I'm saying is the phone calls I received and the understanding that I'm trying to explain to my people, and if those people are my people, the ones that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1725.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that the 60,000 that live in this community, those are those people that had those questions after a very contentious election cycle on Tuesday night, and then put this forward the way it was written.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1738.304s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You could spin it any way you want today, but that's how it was written, and that's why there were questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1744.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So any organization to put on email that spun anything anyway, take it for what it's worth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1750.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because this councilor over and over again, whenever I brought anything forward, have backed it up with video or specific instances that all of you have witnessed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1762.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these are makeup things that have been going on here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1766.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5369.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, to follow up with Councilor Collins, these are the initiatives that really show the community that we're really looking out for the best interest to our most vulnerable and our veterans sure are vulnerable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5384.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for putting this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2678.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Leming, I believe there's a resident that has their hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3397.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Chair Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3398.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate all the hard work we're doing, and I know that I sound like a broken record, but I know as we move forward with, I know Director Hunt's on as well,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3409.637s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, I know I read what we tried to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3413.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We originally, when we first started this process with the RFP for, um, zoning consultants and making sure that we brought these, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3424.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: these steps to the neighborhoods and to the communities that were rezoning step-by-step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3431.917s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's something I thought the former council really stressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3435.239s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that it would help with, we can see lately a lot of misinformation going out and making sure that the right information goes out and going into those neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3448.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that one of the biggest concerns that I keep hearing is that, you know, Salem Street,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3453.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is being rezoned for 12 stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3455.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now I know we're, um, you know, we're saying no, but you have people out there that are spinning a dialogue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3463.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have to make sure that, um, you know, I know that one thing that we asked for in the RFP when, and it's, um, applied for it was a comprehensive plan for, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3474.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: meeting with the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3476.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that we've said that we've had multiple meetings with in this setting, and I don't disagree, but again, I really would recommend that we look at that process and bring it to the neighborhoods where the neighborhoods can really share what they want their neighborhood to look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3497.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think like we've talked about when we rezoned<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3501.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: many as a as a department head in Somerville I was directly involved in the rezoning of different areas in the community where we use this example back a few years ago why we thought it was so important um chair Leming that we had um different city departments like recreation police fire um dpw where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3527.23s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as you put these plans out and these zoning reforms out, that people really felt that they were part of the process and they were helping design what their neighborhoods wanted to look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3539.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you can tell me I'm wrong, but I really would stress that we could follow through with that in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3546.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3640.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, that, that's, that's, uh, that's if I can, Mr. No, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3665.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I apologize that I missed the beginning of the meeting, but as a fitting city council play again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3672.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, my import is is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3675.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is, uh, a piece that's coming from our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3678.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I appreciate council beers, uh, for, uh, expanding on those efforts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3684.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's a, that's a great effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3686.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's something that going back to those residents that have reached out to me and let them know that that's coming down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3692.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's going to be super helpful as we move forward to make sure everybody feels like that's part of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3697.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you very much for your leadership on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3838.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3839.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's great information to share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3841.105s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's where my problem comes in, Commissioner Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3845.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, when we did the RFP, we we knew our limitations in your office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3853.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's why we asked to put that in the RFP to bring in the capable staff of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3861.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and it's to come in and work with those communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3865.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I find it disheartening that we knew that this isn't a secret that we don't have enough staff in your office, but this is why we asked to be put in, and this is why it's written in the RFP as a comprehensive<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3881.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: comprehensive plan for outreach for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3884.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate everything you've done way more than what we talked about the last couple of weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3891.34s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3892.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I'm going to implore that we find a way to go into the neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3899.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just don't, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3902.463s">[Scarpelli]</a>: everybody has to have an opportunity to get involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3907.168s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And like I said, I appreciate what Councilor Beaz is doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3909.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate what your response was and how we're trying to get the information out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3915.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But believe it or not, there's still a big gap between the people that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3921.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that would make it that would make an effort to come into their community and to their neighborhoods to talk about what their visions are to share those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3928.666s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again I know our limitations but again I revert back to our RFP where it's it says that it was and we were pretty clear when we started talking about the RFP as a council that this is the vision why and to all due respect um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3948.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We all agreed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3950.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't think one person didn't agree that this is the type of format that we need to go into the neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3955.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I apologize to be a Debbie Downer, especially with some of the good information that we've heard tonight to get the information out, but I'm sorry, I still think that's not, it's not what we asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3969.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=28.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2664.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4264.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4264.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I will not try to match what Councilor Marks has said, because I said this the other night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4272.526s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what a Councilor does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4275.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council Marks was ahead of this before anybody else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4278.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He did his homework.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4279.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was thorough, and when he went to the meeting the other night, I was on that meeting, and I think it would have done a major disservice if I jumped in with what he's already done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4290.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we're lucky to have him spearhead this effort because there are concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4296.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that Councilor Knight also has done his homework, and I wanna leave what he's done to be presented by his expertise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4306.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All I'm really focused on right now is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4310.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, the understanding that I support Councilor Marks and every syllable he mentioned this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4317.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that there is such confusion out there right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4320.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's coming from the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4323.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's coming from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4326.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: different department heads that who can do what, this is the city council's privy, this is the mayor's privy, so we'll clear that up, I believe, this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4335.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I do want to, if I can, there were department heads that were there the other night, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4341.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you know, unfortunately I can't tell, is Tim McGivern or Alicia Hunt on the call right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4355.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4356.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that as Dave Rodriguez, the chief of staff, is he eligible to speak?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4361.261s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I asked him a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4373.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4379.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council Marks already brought this up, but I wanted to make sure that we had someone on the call today that we can implore to them that the biggest call that one of the biggest bothersome issues that came about was something this council has worked hard to do, and that's making sure that everybody is represented, that everybody has a chance to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4399.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, we can go all the way back to the budget hearings last year that we had enough concerns that we didn't show up to a meeting because we wanted to make sure that there was a forum for everybody to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4410.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We worked hard, the council president worked hard with the administration to make sure we have people here that I will bet you a dollar for everyone that they wouldn't have had an opportunity to get on Zoom to express their concerns to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4424.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're in a safe manner, they're socially distancing, they're following through all the rules,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4429.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that brings me to the biggest question, the biggest issue I had with this, is that a department head mentioned that this, we've heard enough community participation and no one else can speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4449.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wanna make sure that the chief of staff and the department heads understand they're running this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4455.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody that'll be there on Thursday,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4458.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know listen, we've been there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4460.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've been the marathon meetings that lasted to one two o'clock in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4464.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is our job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4465.164s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is your job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4467.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is this affects everybody's just because it might not follow the telephone pole in front of your house doesn't mean that you can't listen to every concern of every citizen in our community because it matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4480.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because today it's in front of one person's home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4484.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But like we talked about, they're expecting another 40, 50 who knows how many more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4489.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this scares a lot of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4491.609s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are a lot of questions out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4493.231s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll tell you, it just tells you how great the city of Medford is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4496.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I heard some great dialogue from some brilliant people in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4502.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, the only people that were answering those questions were scientists, or managers, or people involved with Verizon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4510.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Either they work for the construction companies that'll be doing the installation, they weren't directly, one of the questions, do you work with Verizon?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4519.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the answer was, no, I work for this company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4523.142s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, that's the company that puts in the towers for Verizon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4526.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So technically, he's telling the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4529.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But these are the issues that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4532.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And why do we know that when communication can either help or hurt, with the lack of?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4539.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A few years back, a gentleman named Bill Carr Jr.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4543.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: started a committee to build new fields behind Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4547.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what he did was he went out and secured a cell phone tower of over a million dollars to pay for those fields.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4556.98s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he was given every single hurdle to jump over, every single route to run through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4562.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one of the biggest questions those neighbors had in the area, because everybody knows around the Medford High School area, there's absolutely zero cell space there, that no one can pick up a call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4575.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's one of the number one cell areas in the country, we were told.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4581.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we did is we brought in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4583.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Educators and scientists from MIT and Tufts that we didn't pay, they came in on their own, brought in by the community members because they worked at MIT or worked at Tufts, and they brought these professionals in that really helped all the neighbors understand what the scenarios were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4604.264s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that, to be honest with you, it calmed a lot of people down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4608.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're seeing right now, what I'm hearing now with hundreds of emails and phone calls is the lack of representation of an independent person, an independent scientist that are gonna give us a little more insight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4622.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Instead, we heard some great dialogue from people that have done their homework.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4625.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know one gentleman, he had the study from Europe that they don't allow this at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4629.528s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not even a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4632.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, you know, the Board of Health was a member of that committee who voted no, that should speak volumes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4638.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I implore the city administrators that will be running this meeting, whatever department it is, whether it's Alicia Hunt, whether it's Tim McGivern, that they do not stop the process of our residents being able to speak, because this is their forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4659.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is their community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4661.789s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I will tell you, if that does happen Thursday night, I will do everything in my power to make sure they are punished in every way possible through the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4672.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, Councilor Marks, I will not try to delve into what you've already said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4679.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that it was stated perfectly, and I appreciate you standing strong, and I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4686.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're gonna sue our own entity here in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4690.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not afraid to stand up and make sure that our citizens are safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4693.581s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=582.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So as a coach for 32 years at the high school level, you really try to find inspirations for kids to follow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=589.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You, sir, are a true inspiration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=591.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this city is proud of you, Mustang Country's proud of you, and I wanna congratulate you on a job well done, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=597.765s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=598.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Nice job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2402.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2404.008s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To be redundant, I think it's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2405.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I thank Council Marks for bringing up such an important issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2409.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the emails and the phone calls I received, I think the frustration goes more in depth than just what we're seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2418.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The whole lack of information, the fear that's still out there that hasn't been answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2424.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we move forward, I wonder if we can put an amendment that we can have the Acton City Solicitor to see if we can extend that period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2436.041s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the 20th is the date, I believe, so- Yesterday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2441.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yesterday, so if there's a way that we can put a hold, if there's a way that the city can freeze that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2447.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's some issues that if you have,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2450.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: some of the members in the audience where other communities have put a stop to this, there's something to be gained by understanding that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2459.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So having our city solicitor find any loophole that can stop this ASAP until we get the answers that Council Marks has brought up, I think it's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2470.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'd like to make that into an amendment if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5576.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5702.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, President Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5706.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For those who might look at the census as just an irritant piece of mailing that almost every family gets, every household, and then disregarded and thrown away, I assure to spread the main<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5725.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: issues with the census is making sure that Medford gets as due when it comes to funding from the federal government for education, police, fire, and so on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5739.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's important that as the process is now getting underway,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5744.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we get an idea of what our plan for our city administration is to get the word out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5752.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Neighbor communities I'm seeing are starting a ground roots effort where if you see what the census is doing, they're now offering $28 an hour for workers knowing that it's important to get these issues and these numbers verified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5769.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as you can see, Medford is now a very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5773.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: diverse community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5775.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And with that diverse community comes people of questionable residency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5785.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one of the concerns we have are those numbers count.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5791.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those numbers are very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5793.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we've met and I've talked to different census bureau members that have talked to me about this being a federal law and how this cannot hold against anybody whether their documentation is updated or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5808.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it's something that we need to make sure that our administration has a plan in place that will reach all of our families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5817.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we have an opportunity that it's being sent out in a variety of different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5826.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The important thing that I'm finding out is that the census now, seldom are we gonna see paper versions of the census.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5834.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You can now do it on the telephone, you can do it online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5838.928s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are so many different ways to get this information that's so needed in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5843.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'd like to know, I know that from what I've heard that Neil Osborne is going to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5851.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: spearheading this, but I'd really like to know his plan and what we can do as a council to make sure that they're doing everything possible to get the word out and the comfort level to all the residents of this community that this information is vital.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5867.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to make sure we get everything that's due to us and from the federal government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5872.183s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for hearing me out, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=260.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=261.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see that Mr. Miller has all of their paperwork in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=266.272s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will move forward after maybe a brief, just a summarization from our petitioner and any questions from our Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=313.223s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=315.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if you could just give us a brief overview, Mr. Martin, so we can, and we see all your paperwork is in order, but do you want to just give a little few sentences of what this is to explain to the rest of the council what we're doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=393.424s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's great, so thank you, Mr. Martin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=397.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I've put in the American Legion post.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=402.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We appreciate everything you've done for our country and all the members, and I see that you've done everything that's required through our licensing department, so I move forward for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=414.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=415.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1023.267s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you can, is this line, I'm not seeing if it's illuminated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1272.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1273.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, my question was answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1275.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that being consistent with the other signs, I think I would agree with my fellow councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1281.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1529.684s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1530.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, President Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1531.407s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know my concern also falls with the number of signs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1537.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To have one sign that says free vacuums, I think we can all see, we all know the location, we all see the vacuums.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1544.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But to have 13 signs, I'm just a little nervous of what would be added after that on those awnings, or what's hung on those awnings and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1555.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'd like to hear what my fellow councilors have to say, but I just think this might be a little excessive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1564.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5967.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5968.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, just to reiterate, I think that for what the Historical Commission has in front of them, it's a daunting task when you look at our community and its historical values.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5977.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we all, like Councilman Mark said, I think all of us<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5982.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that the situation that we were put in with this situation had a lot to do with maybe the COVID and the opportunity for both parties to meet in a mutual and respectful manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5996.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think both the commission and the homeowner were great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5999.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We appreciate the opportunity to walk through the site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6003.823s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That piece was glaring, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6005.905s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What's important to me is to sit in front of a home, not behind these chambers, but with the people involved, all in front of each other, face to face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6014.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it was something as simple as Council Marks' experience by working on this council for many, many years to just bring up a topic that maybe both parties can speak on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6029.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is what we're seeing, we're seeing the best of the worst case scenario avoided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6035.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I applaud my colleagues and both the historical commission and the homeowner to reach an agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6044.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because we've seen our share of greeted developers in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6050.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think this homeowner was very open and honest with us and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6059.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we'll work now with our commission to make sure that we are going to keep as much as the historical preservation that we can on that site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6071.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I thank my colleagues and I believe that's a good example of good government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6076.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6740.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6742.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6742.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7762.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7764.473s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like Councilor Mock said, I too supported this in 2016, but I will tell you, I think that because the process does take the time that it will take, unfortunately, this isn't something that this council created or this council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7781.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This council delayed, I think I was one of the four councils voted for that in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7785.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think Councilor Knight brings up a very important point that we started our subcommittee meeting with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7791.346s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's so much going on right now in our community that we,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7796.91s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The focus has to be on the bigger things in our community right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7800.814s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that needs to be done down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7803.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that hopefully as you see things turn and people are back in this chamber and we get to move things forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7810.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Kids are back in school and city business is done a little bit differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7815.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I'll go back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7817.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as of tonight, I think there are too many variables and too many issues that our city is dealing with right now to even spend a minute focused on charter review, considering that, like I said, it is a two to three year process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7830.92s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And right now, I think we need to focus on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7835.805s">[Scarpelli]</a>: issues that are in front of us right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7837.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, again, I thank both Councilor Marks and Councilor Knights viewpoints on both, but I will not be supporting this this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7846.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8046.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that there's areas to agree and disagree, but this is something we agree on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8051.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, what we don't agree on is a timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8054.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that as one council who voted for this in the past, and knowing that it's something that needs to be done, like our zoning and many other things, historical issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8065.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that this is important, but I think right now, I think there's so much that supersedes it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8070.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That if it is offered sometime in the next fiscal year, it'll be something that I will totally<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8075.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: support again, so I thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9558.582s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9859.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate Councilman Marks bringing that forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9861.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, what people don't see behind the scenes is the work that Councilman Knight puts in when the camera's not on him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9869.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that all the questions we had during those<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9875.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those meetings and before those meetings, it was always Councilor Knight that was the go-to guy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9880.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that he put in the hours and effort to really make us shine finally and get this through and moving it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9891.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's a lot of good reasons why we need this, whether you believe in it or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9897.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, we appreciate your work, Councilor Knight, and thank you again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11379.821s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpella.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11381.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, I appreciate Councilor Ike bringing this forward and this is a great initiative moving forward because I think Councilor Caraviello is right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11389.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But one thing that we've talked about and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11393.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And in most other communities, if not all of the communities, they have, I know Councilor Marks has mentioned a thousand times, a clerk of works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11402.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That when there is any type of job, it's up to the city to make sure when that job is completed that there is someone there that signs off and then rechecks that in six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11414.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's what we're lacking here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11415.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're lacking that layer of follow through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11419.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11422.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know how we could move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11424.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that as we look as we move forward, and the tight budget's going to be even tighter, but I don't know if there's an avenue that our DPW director or our engineer can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11442.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: look into and find that person that's going to follow through with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11448.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because I know with the short staff that we have, these things fall through the cracks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11455.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I think that as we move forward looking for an effective way of having a clerk of the works that's going to follow through with these is going to be most effective, I think, than anything here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11467.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12373.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12375.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12375.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for my fellow council members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12378.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to send congratulations over to Richie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12380.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, again, whenever there's a fundraiser and there's a young child going through some horrible issue and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12390.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's going to be a party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12392.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Richie's always the first one to call and donate and be there for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12396.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's why he's been around for 15 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12400.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's why he'll be around for the next 15 years, because he's always there when people need him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12411.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not speaking from experience, but the product's not bad either, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12417.702s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for bringing it forward, and congratulations, Rich.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12724.717s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12725.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I appreciate my fellow councilors bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12728.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that everybody said a lot of great things, and I'd like to just reiterate those statements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12735.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you know it's sad, but you know when a family lays and leaves a legacy behind, and that's what Teresa's done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12742.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12744.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: By the way they raise their children and how they conduct themselves in here in our city of Medford and the legacy that they're passing on is so important to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12754.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I thank them for sharing their mother with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12764.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Maloney was one of the best and I think that we send our condolences and prayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12770.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15862.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15951.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16035.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16036.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We reviewed Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16039.401s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Payne's paperwork, everything seemed in order, and has everything that's needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16046.642s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, if you could just give us a brief synopsis, and then hear from our council colleagues and vote this through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16092.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're just turning the permit over?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16097.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To the same location, same business?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16102.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16103.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: OK, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16104.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I move approval, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16106.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16231.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=469.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3143.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3146.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I just wanted to reiterate my thanks to our team at LMH and thank them for always being on the other end of the phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3155.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I'd be remiss to say the backbone of communications, Sam Tarabelski.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3162.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's nice to see Sam back and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3168.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And just reiterate, we have bumpy roads and to have the commitment of a partnership with Lawrence Memorial and Hallmark Health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3179.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And hopefully as we move forward to bigger projects, especially in our backyard up in the heights in the future, that this partnership stays strong and moves forward in a positive light.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3190.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you everyone for all your hard work and we still have some more to go, so I look forward to our future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3196.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3674.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=4264.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Could you just clarify that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=4266.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I thought last time we talked, Mary Ann, you corrected me and said we were in the green, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5202.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5203.563s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mary, could you just reiterate, I know that I don't want people getting nervous if they read this the wrong way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5209.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You said that the way it's read, that if you talk to two students, one is positive, one is negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5216.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not the case, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5227.236s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, so there's only 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5234.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5239.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so one in two students aren't tested positive, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5241.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's just to make sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5243.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5243.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, thanks Marion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5363.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5364.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5366.297s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5367.118s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much, Marion, with all the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5369.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can you just, so where do we stand with youth sports?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5374.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are youth sports participating now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5378.106s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have they been approved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5441.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So LaConte rink is open then?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5445.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: LaConte rink is open?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5465.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one parent is allowed in the rink at a time with a child?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5477.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, and it looks like the kindergarten are back in school with their teachers, so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5485.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5489.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so what I'm getting at, you're seeing a positive trend here moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5495.455s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that I asked the last subcommittee, I mean the committee, the whole meeting we had to give me some bullet points that I can present to you as a guideline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5505.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had a great conversation, thanks to you, with President Asak from the Brockton City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5512.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they enlighten me on some great avenues to take to open up the council chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5518.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She also enlightened me that the good news is we can use our COVID funding to help fund the opening for open meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5529.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: like our city council meeting, so that was great news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5532.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that I have a question later to our city solicitor to answer some of those questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5537.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But now with the numbers that are increasing, I think that there's some pretty good strategies that I'd like to share with you down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5546.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you can help me out with some of those bullets that I could share back with you to open the council chambers to a safe limit and open it to those people that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5558.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: want to come to our meetings in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5561.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my last question is, I think that, where do we stand right now with Halloween?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5567.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that's going around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5569.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Has the mayor and the department talked about, as Halloween's coming soon, what protocols we're going to be reaching for or what that's looking like right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5579.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that something being talked about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6895.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6898.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mary Ann, I know that when we do our programs and we have the same situations where we bring in large crowds and so are you telling me that it's the custodian?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6909.999s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm assuming that anybody that comes into our buildings for contact tracing, we have a log for everybody that comes in through that entrance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6920.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have a name, a phone number, and an email address, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6924.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6924.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6925.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So do we have those logs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6940.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So our custodians have those locks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6943.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who has them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6956.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That frightens me, because we do that with our Board of Health next door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6964.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know how private and shaky some of these organizations are, that they sort of protect each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6972.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I find it amazing that we don't have, as they walk through the doors,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6976.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a simple check-in where we have clean pens, and then we have pens that are put into a separate area to be disinfected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6985.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And everybody comes in and signs that, and we hold on to that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6991.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if anything comes back from that church organization, that we know that we're contacting those people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7000.312s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I find it hard to believe that we trust outside organizations that want to keep that position in our facilities for future programming, that we would allow them to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7014.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope we consider that, because that's frightening to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7021.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7028.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know if Councilmax is done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7104.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7108.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7108.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm hearing it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7109.636s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I, again, I don't, I hope you don't take this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7112.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not, I appreciate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7124.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And don't take this the wrong way, but it seems like there's a double standard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7127.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We met the other day, and you were so adamantly against opening up these chambers because of the fear of overcrowding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7136.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same time, what you just said with these outside organizations, as passive as, as long as they keep six feet apart for 15 minutes, that's acceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7147.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So-.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7207.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, maybe you are, but I'm just, as I'm moving forward, because I'm trying to put two pieces together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7212.47s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You asked me to put a plan in place to find a way to open these chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7217.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm trying to figure out, because I asked help from our office, because I'm not in a public health background.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7223.892s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I asked for just bullet points that can help me with that, and I hope you can maybe sometime during this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7228.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what I'm trying to get at is just, if I present<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7235.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with the president, the rest of the council, a plan in place that has these new guidelines that this now new phase is brought in with what I can Google the partners that we have and that are using our facilities that got approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7251.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't mean to sound as trivial as it's going to sound, but if it's that easy, then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7261.115s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It sounds that easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7263.016s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not being disrespectful in a way just to let other organizations in and then limit this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7288.584s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7297.681s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7300.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, but that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7308.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7309.526s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll get to that later on in the meeting today, but that's a great answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7312.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7314.628s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, that's great, that's a great answer because I think that that piece of the public health side to open this chamber, that's one of the two components we had a crossroads with last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7323.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for enlightening me, and like I said, I'll go forward with Councilor Scanlon with the open meetings issues and concerns that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7334.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7773.985s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12000.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Ken, the petitioner again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12003.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're saying you have these emails?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12006.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can't hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12007.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12008.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're saying you have these emails?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12023.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12026.33s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you have any other emails saying that you were on an agenda?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12059.546s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then if I can, to our commission, are you familiar with this email that he's talking about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12065.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because to me, this is a big issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12068.571s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12098.677s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, so, and your idea that it was never construed that unless demolition is off the table, you're not welcome at a meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12112.462s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, I'd like to see that email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12114.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13258.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Council President, and thank you, Councilor Marks, for co-sponsoring this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13265.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think those residents do a great job with their curb appeal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13270.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They do the best they can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13272.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Every time I drive by, they're out there with their push brooms, knocking all the debris away from their front doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13279.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they're very patient, and we know that our DPWs try valiantly to try to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13285.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: keep up with those potholes and they fill them on a, I think it's a weekly basis, but I think Councilor Mock said it perfectly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13295.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's just, it's too far gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13297.144s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not a huge stretch, but it does affect those homeowners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13301.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And truly in a negative way, especially with the way they live their lives, which is very orderly and very neat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13308.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I hope that we could find a remedy for them and get that completely done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13314.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, like I said, it's not a big area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13318.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's something we could just move in and move out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13319.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13901.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have it in front of me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13902.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Public Works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13904.293s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm the chair, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13905.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It is Max Caraviellole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14805.231s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll second that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14811.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: John.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14812.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, Sam.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14812.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think I have two of Councilor Marks' three amendments, but I'm trying to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14819.139s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The second one I have is that there needs to be discussion of more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14919.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Real quick, I know I appreciate Councilor Bears bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14922.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's important that we do something, especially before the first snow falls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14926.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But Councilor Marksby, I think we all bring up good points and I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14930.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we could, it's ironic that my neighbor knocked on my door today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14935.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And something if we can add that we didn't realize until about seven months ago, the importance of our first responders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14942.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: She was frantic thinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14944.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If this is the way of the world, she might be gone four days out of a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14950.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if that happens during a snowstorm, she could be penalized for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14953.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So as you go through the subcommittee, I know I'm not on it, but just point of discussion is really look at that as an option too, because I know it's tough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14964.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to distinguish what homeowners are first responders, but I think they'll be negatively impacted with this too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14970.06s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So not to say we don't need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14972.44s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that other communities have great programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14974.921s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know the community that I work for, they have four sidewalk trucks and they send those out, like Councilman Mark said, all throughout the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14983.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they open up every main thoroughway and every park and every school and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14990.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to have to put our money where our mouth is again, and give our DPW the tools to put this to fruition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=14998.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because again, it is the safety of our pedestrians that we're asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15003.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15017.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, just be discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15018.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I trust my colleagues to make that a point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15643.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15666.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Paper 20585 and 28586, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15742.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: make a motion to combine, Mr. President, if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15744.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, uh, they're all the same owner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15848.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15849.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is Mr. Kapoor president today?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15875.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, I apologize for the delay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15880.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or shall I believe, it seems like all of these petitions, everything seems in order and all the paperwork is complete, but just a simple question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15893.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are all these hours of business just transferring over?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15900.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With the owner, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15901.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a change of ownership?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15904.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so everything else stays the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15906.272s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the hours on Middlesex is 9 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15912.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to 8 p.m., then we have Salem Street, 5 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15917.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to 11, and then the Felsway site is open 24 hours, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15930.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so strike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15934.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Middlesex, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15937.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a 24-0.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15939.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, that's the one that's 9-8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15944.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's closed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15945.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, I find everything in order, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15949.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15959.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Before I go, I know what I forgot, I thought I had a note.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15963.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we normally, for new owners, we put just a review, especially for the 24 hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15970.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If Councilor Knight can help me, is it a 60 day review?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15973.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 90- We usually do a 30 and a 60.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15975.548s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 30 and a 60 day review if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15978.269s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those are the only restrictions, if we can, just to revisit as they're new owners to check their standing as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15985.636s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15987.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Should I apologize?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15988.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15993.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right, on the Felsway site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16116.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I guess what I'm saying is- Just an information point to the petitioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16134.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Does the petitioner understand that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16231.34s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good luck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16231.74s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16232.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16294.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16296.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just a clarification, it's Dr. Menon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16299.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's one of the partners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16300.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I might have made a typo there for the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16305.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I went back and I watched a few of the Board of Health meetings and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16314.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I find it interesting that we do have a consortium of physicians that work with our Board of Health Director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16323.33s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it would be nice, just like I said, simple as it is, just to get some ideas of what the health professionals that are working with our Board of Health Director in the process as we move forward and putting together a criteria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16337.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Something that will help, I believe,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16339.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The Board of Health Director asked me to put together the plan, so as they move forward, I'd just like their input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16345.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16426.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16430.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I'm going to reiterate this council's energy to reopen the council chambers for the residents that have reached out, not to eliminate Zoom, but just to add another avenue for those people that want to be heard and want an opportunity to come to this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16456.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Talking to my sister colleague from Brockton, one of the things that they asked for with their city solicitor was, as we do here in the chambers, we have a limit of capacity through fire codes during our meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16478.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we relate it to the COVID crisis and we have a set number and posted such, that would be, from what I've been told, might be the avenue that we need to reopen City Hall and making sure we're not violating any open meeting violations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16497.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I ask this to be sent to the city solicitor to get her opinion and, again, to help me put together this protocol that the Board of Health Director has asked me to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16508.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16606.258s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, this is something that at one point I reached out to fellow colleagues that put this on the agenda as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16616.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is very troublesome and I don't want to wait until it's too late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16621.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As you, we had another pedestrian death as you saw, not in Medford, but in neighboring communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16629.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And before we get to this horrifying scene, I'm shocked that we haven't been there yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16636.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All I want to see is our, it's a very simple ask, is just put those raised crosswalks out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16643.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Slow traffic calming measures that we talked about months ago, and I'll revisit this next week as I ask for a committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16650.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We did get some great news today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16654.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As great as it is, I don't trust the speed of this outcome, but I'd like to share with everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16661.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know everybody got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16662.946s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hi, great news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16664.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I got a call today from Mike So-and-so at MassDOT.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16668.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They have identified the intersection of Main Street and South Street as a priority intersection that they would like to partner with us to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16676.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The initial design intersection improvement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16680.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They would hire a consultant to do this work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16682.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in consultation with the city and would like to know if there are any consultants that have been working with us on this intersection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16690.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: While we have previously been told that we would have to pay this initial design phase, they are willing to fund this initial because it is on the top 200 dangerous intersections in the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16703.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And because of this nexus with the shared use path, in particular the south method connector,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16709.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That would intersect Main Street right on the other side, Route 16.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16714.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Therefore, they see it as an important mass trails connection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16718.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mayor, please let me know, blah, blah, blah, Alicia Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16721.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I want to thank Alicia for doing her due diligence to secure this effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16730.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's sad that the reasons why aren't safety, it looks like it's connection, but we're looking at a dangerous intersection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16739.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I still want to move forward to ask our traffic department and our city administration to put the portable raised crosswalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16748.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: on those intersections to slow things down and give some information back to the dot as we proceed with this consultant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16757.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And great news, I know Councilor Marks last night spent the evening with the ever source team on the south street project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16766.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they approved speed bumps, I believe in a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16772.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I wish it was that easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16773.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wish it was ever source to get.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16777.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to make something happen that quickly, because this has been monumental to try to get anything done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16781.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A sign, paint, raise crosswalk, and I don't know what it has to take.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16787.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And maybe, sadly enough, maybe it takes a death to make something happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16793.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But this is something that we talked with with the last administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16796.571s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something we talked with the mayor as she was partnered with us here as councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16800.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now as our leader in our community, I impressed on her to please<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16805.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: put these out there, make this happen now, because I would hate to see something happen between now and the end of this consultant's report and changing that intersection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16815.366s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's finally been identified as a top 200 dangerous intersection in the state of Massachusetts, but we've all known that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16822.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for all your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16824.233s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16825.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is great news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16826.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I still move forward to make sure that we can do that, and I open to my colleagues, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16830.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16974.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Put it as a resolution next week that we call for subcommittee on D O D O T for this exact one, this exact reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16986.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we can set up a schedule and meet with them, bring them face to face with us and our state delegates and, um, and have that instead of, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17012.541s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I amend that we call for a subcommittee with DOT, our state delegates, our traffic department, and our traffic engineer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17024.651s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And Alicia Hunts, I think she was on the forefront of this, to set up a timeline with the DOT to make sure this comes to fruition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17036.295s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we'll try to do that as soon as we can with the Council of Presidents hope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17040.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17042.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17389.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information, if Council March, if you could add one more line to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17394.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that the question I've had is what steps is the city doing for our employees that were violated and are having issues with their personal information?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17410.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What are they doing to support them, if that's okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17415.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2806.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second that motion, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2899.086s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President and thank you for the I appreciate Councilor Marks bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2904.248s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that We've talked to many residents who?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2908.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: felt a little slighted Tim with the taking of those parking spaces and We can understand the biggest the biggest draw for myself as well as the bike lane is the intersection of Ruben Street and High Street and having an identified crosswalk and a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2927.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh an area now that people are going to have to stop the way they're going to reconfigure that area so i think that is a huge plus it's a it's a to me a huge safety issue we have right now um and and with council mox's uh<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2942.814s">[Scarpelli]</a>: remarks with the with the with the turn I think it's very important and I too was I to talk to a few of the neighbors and the Request I appreciate how it's a mark soon as homework and getting chief Buckley to read to consider the parking overnight I think that's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2959.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So Again, it's all the Brooks parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2961.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We we heard you loud and clear It wasn't at any point that we thought that you know, we don't want to move forward with such you know an initiative, but we also have to make sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2973.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They had to know that we got into this game really late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2978.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, once you've clarified the hundred residents that have been informed and have an end product with the taking of the land,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=2990.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the continuation of the bike lane to make it a true bike lane where I too shared Council Mark's concerns with the dangerous situations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3000.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then looking into that evening parking and the configuration of the high movement, I think it's a no-brainer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3008.77s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I too will support this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3011.653s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I thank all the Brooks parents that originally started this years ago, because I don't know if any of the parents that originally started this project are even in, you know, their children still go to the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3024.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I applaud those parents and moving forward with this initiative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3028.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7238.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I agree with Councilor Marksley and Councilor Naidoo, but I remember, you know, Councilor Falco, I remember the tradition, it was the Friday of Father's Day weekend and then the vote of the school committee was that Monday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7252.859s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was that's what the deal was and we didn't like it then and as this as the we started the process as city councilors We didn't like the process either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7261.526s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I I will tell you the reason why I would like to see this information from our department heads Because this is what other communities are doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7269.532s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've sat with my department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7271.273s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've gone through a five percent ten percent twenty percent reduction With a level funded budget from last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7277.238s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it prepares us so we all know we're all frightened of what's going to happen or what could happen<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7282.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at least we're prepared as a department that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7287.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I am the assistant running that department and getting prepared to, as the time runs out and the state is dragging their feet and the federal government hoping for a buyout, I think we need the opportunity to see what's in front of us, to see what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7303.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't think, you know, the fear is there anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7306.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand what Councilman Mark's saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7307.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think it's our privy to come out and say, okay, look at the budget fire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7312.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're going to have to cut 20 people, God forbid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7315.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it's also,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7318.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: understanding what we're going to see in front of us, not at the 12th hour like we have in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7325.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And believe me, I don't blame this administration at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7329.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the hard work they're doing, getting the auditor in front of us and talking to us and giving us forecasts, but I don't see what it will hurt to get this information in front of us right now from all our department heads so we can understand what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7343.188s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The school department's doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7344.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They understand the situation they're in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7346.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're meeting with their department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7348.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're understanding this situation ahead of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7350.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why wouldn't we, as a city, be prepared in the same situation for the same situation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7355.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So like I said, I know of other communities that are doing a 1-12 budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7360.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've already announced that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7362.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know communities doing a quarterly budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7364.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've already announced that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7366.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what we're seeing is at least they're getting minimal information, maximum information that they can receive, so they're prepared to move forward with their thought process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7376.45s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because this isn't going to be easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7378.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We all know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7379.532s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We all know that if this stays status quo, this is going to be a difficult, difficult time for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7386.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And being nervous,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7389.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, as a municipal employee, I'm nervous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7393.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I look at our numbers, I'm nervous that I might be losing my job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7397.264s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it comes with the territory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7399.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think as city councillors, getting that information in front of us is going to be important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7404.207s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's why, you know, I understand, I don't want to put the fear on anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7407.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But unfortunately, sometimes understanding something maybe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7414.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When your back's against the wall, this is when people push to our state delegates and reach out to the governor and reach out to the federal government, reach out so the president can hear us and say, listen, we need maybe not a trillion dollar bailout package, but maybe some kind of a package that we're focusing on our state and local<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7434.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: local governments to support us and what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7437.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So sitting back, I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7439.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just don't think that that, I think we need, I don't think we need to go after it and help and scare people and the sky is falling mentality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7448.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think we need to be prepared as a council to see what shortfalls are coming with each department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7453.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's important to what we have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7455.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I support that initiative, Mr. Councilman Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7459.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7746.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7746.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7747.373s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate Councilor Bears' initiative to try and think outside the box, but I too, I think using an analogy my dad told me is, you know, to pay off your car, remortgage your home, to look at the possibility to pay a $20,000 car loan over 30 years that now it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7768.496s">[Scarpelli]</a>: piles on top of what your bills are, just doesn't, I can't see that this concerning us today, leaving this to our next generation to pay for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7782.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So believe me, I appreciate that maybe there's some other ways that we can think of creating revenue sources and bringing money in and trying to focus on being<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7795.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know being creative and gutsy to go out and do it, but I think bonding our way out of that I just I I can't support that so I just want to make sure I made it public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=173.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=174.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=175.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thanks for bringing this forward, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=178.919s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council President, this is, this is a family that again you have to celebrate because although they owned a successful business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=186.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They were always one of the first businesses get back to the youth of the community so often you go in there, and you'd see a new plaque.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=195.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: express those representing and sponsoring another youth team or activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=199.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I've had the pleasure to know a lot of this Salvato family, and I know that they've done so much for our community, and I would support and second Councilor Knight's motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=213.865s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=473.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=475.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we move forward and we're seeing the uptick with numbers and what we're hearing is that the state isn't really going to look going backwards at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=487.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we move forward and we look at the issues of opening school and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=494.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: opening of the city council for meetings that be interesting to know if there is money that's still needed to the school system and what type of money they've used moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=505.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, and to see if there's, if there's need that we need to address as a council to move some initiatives forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=512.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I put that out as a resolution and hopefully my colleagues agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=587.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=589.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we get closer, we see the unbelievable completion of that beautiful building, our police station, and something we should be very proud of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=599.183s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, it poses a bigger issue once that building is open and the crosswalk where we've been talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=612.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: between south and main issues now with the police station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=617.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's going to be interesting to see what type of plan we have in place, or is there any part of discussion about putting in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=623.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that what was discussed in the past were the rhino lights, the temporary crossing lights that could be installed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=630.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know if that's going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=631.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it was mentioned, and I know that we did call for a meeting, hopefully, talking to Representative Donato.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=638.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're trying to get something for next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=641.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for next Tuesday at 530 just to discuss the top, one of the top 200 most dangerous intersections in the Commonwealth, Maine and South.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=652.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now that we have some money coming from the state and the state DOT now<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=658.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: agrees that this is one of the most dangerous intersections, and we need to move forward as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=664.77s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, with that conversation, to reiterate what I talked about last week, putting in the raised crosswalks as soon as possible to see how that can slow that traffic down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=675.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm hoping we get some answers, and we move forward in a positive light.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=684.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=701.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The hope is that the discussion tonight with this resolution, with the traffic engineer being part of that meeting next week, that'll be something we could draw out all at once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=709.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't want to delay anything else as we're moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=712.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=713.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1197.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: have the traffic engineer on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1956.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1957.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First, let me thank Councilman Knight for bringing up a very major point, a very important point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1962.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that what we're hearing from the state and what's being talked about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1969.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the fiscal damage that we're going to see in a year is going to be pretty damaging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1975.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think it's important that the request that he put forth a while ago that we do meet and really understand where we are, especially with the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1986.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the free cash and where we stand with that, and where we stand with our taxes and our collections and stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1995.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think it's important that we have an idea of where we are as we move forward, because let's not make this a secret.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2002.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Things are going to get really, really, really tough soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2005.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're going to have to make some hard decisions if we're not going to get the support that we need, both in the state and the federal side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2012.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2015.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second, I know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2020.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're looking at the raised crosswalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2023.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a great question, and it's something that was a great solution for the Central Ave location with Morrison-Parkes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2033.107s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because before that pilot program, it was just a speedway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2038.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then it made a huge difference, being on the school committee back then, that that was one of the huge concern with the kids in the neighborhood, and the bus stops, and so on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2051.626s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That is a huge concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2054.929s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But you see in neighbor communities, I know Todd might be familiar with it, I know that on Powder House Boulevard, there was an awful accident and a pedestrian death there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2064.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what they did there is they didn't put<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2067.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a raised sidewalk, but they put a raised roadway with arrows depicting the rise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2074.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it really slows that traffic down in front of that school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2078.289s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I can't see that being a major cost where it's actually, it was put into place very, very quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2087.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were no decorative blocks, but there is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2091.494s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a clear rise that slows down that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2096.037s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that if we can look into that, Todd, I'd love to get an idea if we can even possibly do that in some of the locations, including South Street, Main Street, as we're waiting for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2109.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: get through and see what they can do, but I'm just afraid we're going to get to a situation where there's going to be a death in one of these areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2116.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're going to be telling each other, we told you so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2121.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't want that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2122.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if there's a way that we can look into that and look at some of this money because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2127.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I need some clarity on what we're seeing around the neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2131.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know it might be like the 3,000, the 4,000, 5,000 hits with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2137.869s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if you do it 15 times in the community, it's $50,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2145.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's something that looks temporary all over the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2148.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have light white paint around intersection streets with these white<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2159.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're not cones, they're just sticks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2161.761s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And within the first week that I saw them, especially in South Medford, they were knocked over immediately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2168.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can you explain, is that temporary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2170.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that, how are we going to deal with that when it comes to, the question I had with the raised sidewalk at South and Main during the winter was, well, with plowing, we can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2179.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, with all these sticks all over the place, how are we going to manage that area in that situation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2233.173s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2339.563s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So with that, I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2340.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I really think something like that, where that's more cost efficient, but more importantly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2349.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's long lasting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2352.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you're looking at something that's $10,000, putting in that what they've done on Grove Street and add that to what you can do at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2362.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: at Central Ave, using that example, that would drastically slow down that dangerous roadway by putting those cheaper, more efficient hurdles to slow that traffic down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2377.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But at the same time, not looking at, because I'll tell you the truth, Todd, I appreciate everything you guys are doing, and I appreciate trying these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2383.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when you're looking at putting in ten different areas with this temporary<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2391.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: $4,000 hits here and there, to me, I just think that it's not worth doing it right now until we're doing the full-time piece and using that money to something like the raised roadway in Central and other locations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2410.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's my preference, but that's my concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2414.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I look at equity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2420.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've been talking about Riverside Ave, Todd, for a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2423.486s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I don't see anything here with Riverside Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2426.329s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a major complex with two of the biggest schools in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2432.153s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's been some issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2434.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've had some issues there with both lack of cross lights, with traffic calming measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2441.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And did we entertain anything on Riverside Ave?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2536.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this- And I just want you to know, Todd, you came into a very difficult position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2544.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and I'm not, this is just conversation that I've talked to constituents about, and just to share comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2550.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that you're doing a great job, and we are seeing a drastic difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2554.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think people in our community see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2557.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've committed to traffic calming measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2561.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And other than South and Main, I'm going to be honest with you, throughout the rest of the city, I think we've seen a huge support by your office in this community to say, let's try to find ways to make it happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2573.698s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I really appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2575.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't want to, I'm not, if it sounds negative, I don't, I'm just looking at other avenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=2658.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=195.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh Chair, still in doubt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=196.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, you know, is the legal representation, is Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=201.297s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Scanlon on or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=202.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Mulkey on tonight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=206.045s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because unfortunately I hate to hold our petition up again, but it is a valid question that we needed answered for tonight's meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=214.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe we actually put in the resolution that it was date determined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=220.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was, you know, we were pretty strict about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=223.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're under the assumption that would the chief of staff know any way to, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=232.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: find a way to contact either the city solicitor or Mr. Mulkey to get on the call later on this evening so we don't have to do another night and just table this for later on in the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=245.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=254.107s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=255.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm in total.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=256.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is there a way to reach out to the city solicitor to see if they can answer that question or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=269.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll do that right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=271.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hate to waste the petitioners another week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=274.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that it's a question that's a legitimate question that we need before we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=284.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=287.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: At the table until we get communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=290.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if you could just ask the petitioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=299.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right, just so the petitioner knows, we're just waiting for what we're asking for from the legal department to let us know that we're taking the proper course so that doesn't affect you moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=313.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're just waiting for someone if they can call us before the end of the meeting tonight, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=317.203s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=398.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Knight, for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=399.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I honestly, I thought that if he doesn't mind me adding my name to this resolution, I thought I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=404.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm very close friends, graduated with the sun common.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=408.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and friends with his daughter, Fran.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=411.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Palmisano was bigger than life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=413.584s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was that type of life of the party that worked for years for the Duck Tours and was a legend there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=421.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Always a person to make other people laugh and make other people feel comfortable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=427.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Another member of our community that had a battle of devastating illness and unfortunately,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=437.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: passed on that with the major suffering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=445.911s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's something that, you know, you wish you could take away, but I know that he's not in pain anymore and he's in a better place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=452.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And for his family, you know, Method residents who grew up and loved our community and, you know, raised by his wonderful parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=464.056s">[Scarpelli]</a>: their wonderful parents and Mr. Parmigiano was definitely the anchor of that family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=469.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So some of that will be missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=471.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I condolences to the Parmigiano family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=896.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would second that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=902.516s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=903.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=906.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First, I'd like to thank, I know there's a group of residents that are actively taking a role in making sure that this is presented the right way so it's sent to the state in the most positive light moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=929.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I was first elected, one of my first<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=934.079s">[Scarpelli]</a>: one of my first initiatives was looking at the charter view and making sure that we could revisit something that we haven't seen in so many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=940.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that had changed with me last time we voted, I voted no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=947.268s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the reasons were very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=951.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was so simple that what was asked for was yes or no and move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=958.256s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's important that as you talk about a commission,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=962.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One of the biggest things I think needs some debate is the understanding of ward and precinct representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=969.822s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that sounds so easy for everybody and there are definitely some pros in that aspect of making sure that each ward are represented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=983.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: speaking for myself, working in a municipality in a community that has ward and precinct representation, I see a lot of negative affects of that situation where it becomes a special interest option, special interest groups around the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1001.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I see is a lot of negativity in the sense that you have one community member and one part of the community holding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1011.636s">[Scarpelli]</a>: their colleagues hostage in for what they want their initiatives to move forward not what's greater for their community as a whole, but for their small piece of the community and you could, I saw negative effects, a few times that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1027.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It didn't, it didn't help the community, and, and that's because of that and you know some other options that when you know you get a phone call from someone from South Medford or get a phone call from someone from West Medford or someone from the Walton Glenwood area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1046.548s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I work just as hard as if it was someone in my own backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1050.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it gives people the opportunities to call seven different Councilors to really push an initiative, or a concern that they're not following so I see the benefits there I know that there are benefits to go through with it to look at that but again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1067.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when it was first presented as charter change or charter review, it was cut and dry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1073.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had a great discussion with some members of the committee and talking about having a forum where we could discuss these options, where it's more of a thought process that it's discussed, it's understood, and maybe moving forward, it could be something that as you go forward with the initiative,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1095.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and what you're looking for for charter review, at least.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1099.835s">[Scarpelli]</a>: every piece is broken down and discussed and then thought upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1106.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but I do think these, as we move forward with this initiative, I think that I would support it now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1116.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would move forward, I think, but it's also a lot of questions that I think that we should really meet together with the administration and the committee members that are looking to form this commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1129.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: um meet in the community the whole meeting and iron out any concerns and issues and then bring this forth with the with the solid base so we can move forward with the vote of seven zero to go to um the state house so we have no issues or concerns because i think that was the biggest thing as we move forward in the past it was unanimous<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1150.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: support from a council to the State House saying we all support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1154.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that, you know, making sure that we have all of our questions answered and all of our I's dotted and T's crossed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1163.63s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think moving this to a committee of the whole in a relatively short period of time that we can get all the stakeholders in this room to discuss all the questions and then put this forth to a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1176.094s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And later on they<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1177.814s">[Scarpelli]</a>: next meeting so we can find a way to move forward in a seven zero vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1182.015s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would, I would recommend that tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1184.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's an emotion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2603.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, they're tied up with the family situation right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2607.666s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't wanna waste, I don't wanna have you sitting here wasting the rest of your evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2611.949s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we can ask the clerk to have the answer reported back to the council and have someone from the city solicitor's office on the meeting for next week so we can get this taken care of and the answer that Councilor Knight can move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2628.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You can come forward if you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2630.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2656.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know, but it's a way that the permit process, the way it goes through, it has to be asked the proper way, and the way that it was asked leaves doubt, and not anything that you did, it was- I mean, I'm just an immigrant from Albania coming to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2669.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, no, I know, and we wanna-<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2672.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't, we don't want...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2675.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now you're out of line right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2676.999s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're way out of line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2678.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If that's what you want, you're voting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2679.7s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You won't win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2680.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll tell you what, you're out of line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2682.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm trying to be kind to have you understand the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2684.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This has nothing about you or race.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2686.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For you to say that, you're out of line, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2693.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I move to continue this until next meeting, have a representative from the law department to answer this question that has something simple to do with the process, has nothing to do with you or the permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2708.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It has the process that leaves it in doubt, the way it was presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2712.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all it was, has nothing to do with the existing permit or anything moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2716.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To tell you the truth, I don't think anybody in this, including the question from the council who asked that we're not going to support this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2723.819s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've always supported our business owners, whether you were Italian or Irish or whatnot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2729.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you, there's a question that if we proceed with this, Mr. Abazi, and later we found out we made a mistake, that could affect your business and stop it then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2739.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we don't want that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2740.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's the reason why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2741.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2751.517s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I completely understand, but like I said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2777.889s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2779.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2783.212s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, we're saying that, listen, when we put this out for you last week, we asked the administration to have that answer to us so we can just let you move forward today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2791.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, we don't know where that where that dropped and we're going to as a council, we'll look into that because these are the issues we have, we've been fighting with this council to have legal representation at every single night for issues like this because this puts us in a bad way Mr. Bosley, and it's not you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2806.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So and I apologize for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2809.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will tell you I understand you want to work but I also don't want to approve something then come down the line that we have to then hold your permit and someone comes in from another department the city and say hey wait a second, you can't proceed, and then that affects your business in a way negative in a manner that will hurt you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2825.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: more than you think you're being hurt right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2827.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I apologize if you think you're being singled out or attacked in any way, but this is just a policy procedure that we have to correct that someone made a mistake on, not you, not you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2839.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's somebody that should have answered this question and you should have been gone an hour ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2844.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, we're gonna we're gonna take care of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2846.949s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will tell you, you don't need to be in next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2848.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2849.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council Council night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2850.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You don't have to be in next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3403.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any further discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3409.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3414.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like I said, I worked the storm in Somerville, and I think that I'm one of the first people people talk to when their cars are being towed and ticketed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3424.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So as an administrator there, that's one of my duties while the administrators are on the road working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3431.099s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the signage you're talking about really is put in place after the storms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3436.761s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when they're going to remove the snow mounds up and down the street, the snow emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3442.229s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Some of them luckily has the blinking lights at all the all the the storm alerts that are all the blinking lights, all the street lights that are blinking white light that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3453.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That calls for snow emergency for people to look at what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3457.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They do a reverse 911.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3460.613s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They do a, an email blast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3463.376s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then the last thing they do before they get told is actually the police officers actually traverse the streets with the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3470.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with the tow trucks saying, please move your cars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3473.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's under snow emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3474.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, but I think having the signs out there, if there's a way to keep it, I think that poses a couple of different concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3483.072s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One that we're going to have DPW workers that are going to possibly working, if it's a big storm like that, that are going to be possibly working 24 to 36 hours and having them go out hours early to put up signs or hours after to put up signs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3496.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that it really takes away from what we really need them to be doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3500.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that, you know, maybe working with the communications department to find a way to reach those citizens that reach out to you, that are not getting the notifications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3516.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But, you know, I think the signs might, I don't think they'll work in our community for that fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3523.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just don't think we have the manpower to actually<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3528.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: put those signs out and then if you're talking big snow, they're probably covered within an hour anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3535.079s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just think that there is a way that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3541.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: doing reverse 911 letting everybody know that there's a snow emergency, and what the policy is and which side to park on posting it on on public access television on the loop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3553.939s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then, you know, sending out city wide emails that that people that aren't on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3560.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think a lot of people that don't get notifications, it's just because they haven't been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3565.264s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They haven't been put on the list with communications and we've had thousands of people asked me, and all they really need to do is contact communications department and have their names and phone numbers added to that list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3576.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that if there is a snow emergency, they'll get taxpayer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3581.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, one of the biggest things I have, being that I work in Somerville, I get the same notifications that residents get in Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3588.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'll get an email, I'll get a robo call, and I'll get a text message, you know, throughout the day before a snow emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3596.518s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Once a snow emergency is gonna be declared, letting me know, and I live in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3601.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't think this is a difficult ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3603.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just think that it should be, you know, maybe a little coordinated with the communications director moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3609.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, a little winded,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3611.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3612.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for bringing it forward, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3701.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but maybe looking at the portable digital sign posted in strategic areas that don't really get the information they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3709.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think the sign itself, I just don't see that working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3715.8s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so I agree with you, every which way we can to help to get the word out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=192.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=193.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Brennan, for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=195.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I do see your paperwork is all in order and it's acceptable in my eyes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=202.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we have a few questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=205.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The location being one, I know there's some confusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=207.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It says 177 College Ave, Mr. Brennan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=210.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that located inside?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=213.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: facility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=223.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, and it obviously will be open for the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=228.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And not students that was a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=233.381s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What are the what are the hours of operations you're planning on having.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=254.659s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, and there's, I see everything's in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=257.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that one of the biggest issues in that area is traffic and that has been approved with no hindrances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=263.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=267.249s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I open the floor to my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=269.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=341.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=397.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=399.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=517.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1616.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1616.933s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, there were some concerns earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1620.814s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know there are some limitations, we do have limitations of the information we can give about the person that has already been diagnosed and found to have the virus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1632.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it safe to say or could we say that it has nothing to do with the schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1635.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I think that was one of the concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1636.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I think the kids right now, they're feeling anxiety probably more than anybody right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1643.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So just making sure if we could just say it has no one to do with the schools and we're safe from the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1673.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3421.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There is a suspension in communications from the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3563.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3565.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3566.77s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that you coming up, I know that it's a little nerve wracking when you're coming up to speak, but you did a great job in presenting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3574.374s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we've had some of your student body here before, some of your friends, and they've brought up some great initiatives, and we're so excited that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3584.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: here again, and our goal is really to make Medford beautiful and share what we're truly about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3592.964s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that the four categories you chose for Duggar Park, I think it's a great<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3600.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: way to spread that love.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3602.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think you guys have done a great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3603.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is a great initiative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3605.899s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that my son John is also doing some great things with a great historian, Mr. Ken Krause.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3614.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So everything is nonstop and it's so exciting to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3617.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I fully support this paper and move forward for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4008.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4009.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I talked to the petitioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4011.65s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4013.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm requesting a table till next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4017.373s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Table till next week?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4018.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4511.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, through the chair, to Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4514.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In layman's terms, if people can understand,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4517.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This resolution is really to have the voice of the people heard and not stifled, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4541.875s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And in recent, as we can see, we had some discussions about open meeting laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4549.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that I applaud my fellow Councilor to look at these concerns under transparency to make sure that the people are heard and we're giving them the proper forum where we're not stifled and they're not stifled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4565.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I applaud you with this resolution and I support it wholeheartedly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4570.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5289.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I too applaud Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5293.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that as a municipal worker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5296.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: who's someone who doesn't take sick days, people that are out there might question even with this intent, you know, that this is compromising city funding, but what they make sure they understand the way that it works is when people retire with the bank of sick days, they're then bought out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5317.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you could look at, we're going through that right now where we have a custodian that is battling<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5324.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: cancer, and he has a family of four, and he looks like, thank God, he's going to pull through, but without the sick bank process that we have in the community that I work in, that individual would have lost his home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5338.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these are real issues, and this is what I think what Medford's all about, in helping your neighbor and your<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5346.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm actually shocked that I didn't know that we didn't have it in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5351.22s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I applaud Councilor Knight and I second the resolve, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6052.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, I understand Councilor Marks' hesitation, but I think the meeting we just had in the subcommittee that outlined the limitations we have as a council now that limits our residents to come up and speak, I support this for the fact that being sponsored and having<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6073.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: an avenue to make sure that the constituent has a voice and is on the agenda as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6081.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because I think this is going to be a huge culture change in understanding what we can talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6088.545s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So as Councilman Mark said, I know that the biggest issue we had in subcommittees where in the past a resident would come up, have a concern, a serious concern, but we would support that by having a dialogue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6104.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: by the rule now, that violating the open meeting law, that limits that now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6112.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It eliminates that completely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6114.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We can't talk about it, so Mrs. Jones comes up and talks about some serious issue that we need the police involved in, something that I believe was emergency or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6126.453s">[Scarpelli]</a>: natural disaster that we can speak on at the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6129.799s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it limits different speaking points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6132.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So with this, I support it for the fact that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6136.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If there's an issue, we have a constituent that has a problem, we assign the number to it, we sponsor it as a council, and make sure that that issue is presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6145.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So this is why I feel that it's needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6148.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's all in the same breath.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6149.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we're all looking at making sure that our constituents are heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6155.031s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And understand again that this is going to be a big change for what we're used to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6161.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when doing business, when people come to that podium, because what we were told by ruling of the attorney general is that we can't talk to you as a council in fear of violating the open meeting law on concerns and issues that are brought to that podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6178.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So whether we like it or not, this is the reason why I support Councilor Knight's motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6184.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7992.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, being close friends with both, um, the Morse brothers and understanding that, uh, what Mr. and Mrs. Morse have done left, uh, with, uh, teaching their children, uh, that community is very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8008.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to lose her was a great loss to Dennis and Hank, but I know that we wish them well and share our support with their family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8020.598s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8925.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, I can understand Councilor Knight's presentation, the understanding that we've had some recent, uh, recent concerns, but I, I too, with Council Marks, I know that the Felsway has turned into, um, you know, front yard, um, parking areas and it does take away the appearance of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8948.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think, um, although in good intention, I don't think I can support this either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8953.681s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9043.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please, if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9045.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The motion to suspend the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9058.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9059.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Petitions, presentations, and similar papers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9062.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we've had a petitioner here waiting patiently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9064.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 20-100.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9065.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9066.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9120.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President, and forgive us for...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9125.386s">[Scarpelli]</a>: having you sit so long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9126.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that all the paperwork is in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9130.209s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have everything in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9131.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that this is a Lambert Street location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9136.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have you worked in the field before?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9138.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have you been in the business before?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9139.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9140.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9141.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9142.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what type of food do you bring to this location?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9148.582s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it just pizza or is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9153.563s">[Scarpelli]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9154.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9155.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How many people will be working for you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9159.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9160.489s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hours of operation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9166.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9167.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that falls on the premise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9168.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, I have no other questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9169.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9363.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9365.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just public for the viewing public, I know that I've received some emails from constituents that are totally against this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9372.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, to their understandings that this is something that was voted on in 2016.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9378.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we are required as a city council and a city to provide, I believe, at least three licenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9388.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whether you're for it or against it, I just wanted to reiterate that this is a mandate after the vote that was taken and moving forward with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9399.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that Councilor Knight has already contacted us to move forward quickly and get a resolve and move this petition forward, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2990.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2993.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were some questions that when I asked, it was already taken care of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2996.486s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4149.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Seconded, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4557.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7537.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Point of information, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7544.107s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hate to interrupt, but Mr. Mochi, if let's say my neighbor who has a house that is 80 years old and she's a senior citizen and she needs to redo her windows, we have to now wait and get approval from the historical mission to get approval to get these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7566.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This could be a huge burden, financial burden on our seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7570.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The only reason why I know this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7572.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as my brother-in-law purchased a home, didn't know it was a historical site, and what would have cost him $5,000 for windows turned into over $25,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7582.895s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I find this a little scary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18402.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22055.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22342.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=23657.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1188.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1190.2s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1191.26s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is such a welcoming addition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1196.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that especially when you hear some of the bantering of the negativity of the pop-up park and the parking lot where there's no shade, there's nothing that really attracts<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1208.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: families to that area in the concept that we're seeing here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1212.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think this really fills a gap in Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1216.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is something I'll support 1,000%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1220.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The question I had is I know that we've had residents that made that the chess hub of the world, it seemed, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1228.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know one resident worked very hard<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1233.069s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the tables there, the chest tables and those coverings going to be able to shade those areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1265.382s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, if you can, just if you can reach out to the resident, I'll share his information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1269.544s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sure you know it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1270.425s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1270.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if you can just, you know, even maybe get him involved in saying, okay, as you kind of built this area and really made it when people didn't know what it was going to be used for, he kind of made it a home for families and kids that really needed an area to meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1287.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that it was, it was a great vision and great opportunity for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1291.135s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate all your hard work and I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1293.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is going to be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1294.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2478.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I know, you know, this is such a great gesture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2481.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's exactly your heart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2482.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we appreciate that because you know what it does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2486.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think we'll ever forget Larry, but just a little symbol to keep Larry's light alive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2492.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is a great fitting tribute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2493.609s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for that idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2495.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that if there is something that if we need to make sure that happens and look for some other alternative funding, I think that we as a council should try to find some other avenues to make sure that that happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2507.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that'd be a great gesture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1588.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1673.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1674.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that I appreciate all the hard work everybody's done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1678.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know this has been a long time coming, and there's just a couple of concerns that residents have reached out to me about that couldn't make it to this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1685.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that Commissioner McGiven helped with a lot of those questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1691.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that as honorable and as lucky as we are to have a committee of dedicated members of our community, I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1703.001s">[Scarpelli]</a>: really that there is some fear that having a community group making decisions that affect homeowners left some questions with our residents, but I appreciate the clear questions and definitions from Commissioner McGiven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=1721.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2387.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilors, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2388.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And please forgive me, I was hoping, I know that we might, I guess we had a glitch early in the meeting, so I have to pop out again in a few minutes to shut down a program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2401.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just wanted to, if I can jump in a little bit early, just to give some comments, if that's okay, President Bez.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2406.447s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2409.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate Commissioner McGiven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2411.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's kind of the questions that I had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2414.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Also with former Commissioner Forte, we really had some in-depth conversation with him and his vision with what he saw as the enforcement piece as we moved, especially to the private protection piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2430.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that in my situation, I do think that this is a lot of work and there's a lot of work that was done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2438.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There were so many changes that I hope that we do move on to another meeting with our city department heads because I think it's important that we do do a cost analysis and especially moving into the next budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2451.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with all the new money we have looking into bringing qualified professionals into departments that can handle such a task.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2461.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think what I'm hearing is, and I won't speak for Commissioner McGiven, but it sounds like this will really overwhelm our existing team in comparison to what they're already doing today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2475.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2477.817s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I had a brief discussion with the building commission today was great and he's ready to do everything and anything possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2484.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as you look at the private tree protection, I think 1 of the biggest concerns that we had starting a few years ago is really.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2494.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: um, having government come in and tell residents what they can do on their own property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2500.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, and this isn't this, this doesn't affect thousands of trees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2504.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think this affects many trees, but I think it does affect the quality of life and the expectations of homeowners that might want to, um, you know, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2516.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have some I have to be very careful with my ethics when we talk about solar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2521.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm going to leave that to the side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2523.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But there's some questions the other residents had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2526.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that I think Attorney Stein did put in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2531.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh, some legal pieces when it came into the opinion of subject of challenge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2536.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, if we wrote in an ordinance and making some of these changes to the private, uh, tree protection plan, I think that, uh, that that might be again, that's something we talked about in the past and many, many meetings about being a slippery slope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2550.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the former commissioner, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2555.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh, uh, Forte really had a plan in place that he was willing to share with us that is used in neighboring communities that really didn't affect most members of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2565.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I fully support when we talk about new development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2569.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, I fully support when we have people coming in and flipping houses and taking down trees to, to, uh, find a way to mitigate that with the tree fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2579.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's a superb idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2580.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's something that will really benefit moving forward with, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2585.454s">[Scarpelli]</a>: taking care of our tree canopy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2586.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2587.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But, um, again, I think there are still so many questions when it comes to the price, especially the private piece and the implementation pieces with either the DPW and their tree service team and, um, the building commissioner and his team when it comes to, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2608.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: moving forward with any of these added duties with the tree process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2614.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I apologize for leaving early.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2619.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate you allowing me, Council President, to share the concerns that was offered to me from some residents and historically what we've been talking about for many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2630.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I do wanna see this move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2633.691s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, in any way, try to hold this back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2635.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we have so many great ideas, and I think that, uh, our volunteers did a great job to help design and and craft an ordinance that really has some meat on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2649.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think with a lot of these red line changes, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2653.928s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A lot of people were confused as well in what was happening and we're a little nervous about there'll be a vote tonight, but I do think this is a good piece to, you know, my recommendation, move this to another meeting and bring all the city staff with some, after they've revisited all of these changes and put together a plan on how we could really make this work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2674.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I thank everybody and I apologize for my dismissal, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2717.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, I thank you and I now leave the meeting so you can speed up your half and not waiting on roll calls, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0fZ4E0HakWA&t=2724.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1743.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Ted, for you and your team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1746.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know you guys have been super busy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1749.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I think that questions people ask, usually this is later in the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1753.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would assume that this is tied into what's gonna happen in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1758.769s">[Scarpelli]</a>: which is the increase of the override to people's taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1762.734s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the phone calls I received, should we come to these meetings, can we stop it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1767.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I tried to explain to residents that, you know, so they can understand in layman terms that this is a tax rate that we are not going to put forth and whatever this council decides, plus what the override is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1783.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So someone that's a million dollar home, you'll see, you know, that 7,800, 7,500 a year tax now then increased another, I know one resident<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1794.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: was quoted about $800 for their home for an addition on top of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1799.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think this is why people are asking, why are we doing this meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1803.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's, you know, I want to make sure it's clear that we're doing this so we can, that we give your team enough time to set this rate, then we can move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1812.419s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So in January, everything will be in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1814.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So just to let everybody know, it is happening in January that the override<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1820.929s">[Scarpelli]</a>: increase will be added in top of this, which the rates were, the new assessment, like was said, was assessed from the 2023 sales home sales, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1832.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1833.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's one thing I wanted to make sure that everybody knows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1838.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that, again, to be clear, this is year after year that the override tax doesn't disappear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1845.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This just increases plus two and a half percent, if that so be it, every year to follow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1850.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that's what the questions were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1855.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then the other thing that's confusing people when you talk about new growth, when you hear new growth in communities that have a booming commercial base or you're seeing a new tax revenue coming from new development,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1872.407s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the new growth we haven't seen much in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1875.509s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I want people to understand the new growth that we've been talking about during the override, it's new growth coming from increasing taxes that we see as the levy increases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1888.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I want people to understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1889.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that was very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1892.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was a question that's been brought up saying that, oh no, they've heard from some councils that said that Medford was number one in Massachusetts in new growth, which isn't true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1902.286s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just wanted to make sure that those points were just brought up tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1909.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's a different new growth<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1911.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we talk about new growth and development is very different than what you talked about tonight, and new growth and tax assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1918.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So am I correct with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1919.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to speak for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1946.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1947.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then I think that the last piece is what everybody's asking for now is what Mr. Castagnetti has been saying for years is the owner occupied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1956.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's a slippery slope because it sounds so easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1958.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my neighbor who's 86 years old said, George, if this, if you vote in the tax exemption, I'm living a single family home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1966.969s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I'm if the exemption goes through for homeowners and I get my taxes would be lower than what they were in the previous years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1974.078s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I said that's true, but when you look at the way we look at the big picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1979.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It affects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1981.348s">[Scarpelli]</a>: majority of our residents in a negative way, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1984.631s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Their tax will increase even higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2019.127s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the word is out that Somerville does it, Cambridge does it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2022.048s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why is it beneficial for their communities?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2023.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What do they have that we don't that allows them to do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2040.156s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So typically, communities like that will adopt it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2043.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2044.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2045.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: appreciate all the hard work you guys, your team has done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2048.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's been, uh, I know it's been trying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2050.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that you were on the hot seat a month ago and I apologize for any, any, um, you know, um, uncomfortable questions that were asked, but I know it was, you stood there and did a wonderful job and, and, uh, we, you know, appreciate getting that out the Friday, the week before, so people can get a better understanding of what it looked like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2069.24s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2070.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's why we had such a close vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2073.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was very close because of that fact that people started realizing the true numbers and the effects that we're gonna have on the homeowners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2079.775s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=2081.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3909.351s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're seeing things that, unfortunately, your department<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3914.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been tasked to do things way too late, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3919.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm glad to see my fellow colleagues are now realizing after they supported the override that how the vulnerable community is really gonna hurt now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3929.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're hurting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3930.576s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's something that I welcome the conversation starting earlier now to look at that homeowner exemption because of that demographic that I was screaming about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3944.065s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that bought their homes for $50,000, but now they're worth a million, and they're being priced out with additional override taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3952.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm glad to hear that we're at least understanding it now, and that there's pain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3959.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's going to be something that we should do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3961.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't know if you'll be here in June to do that with us, but we really need to look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3966.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3968.197s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We also have to be alarmed, as some residents have said when we talked about this issue, is that the burden falls on who?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3975.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It falls on the homeowners that have rental properties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3980.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Those are the ones that are going to pick up the burden if the exemption comes into play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3984.649s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the fear now is the talk that was started last year was rent control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3990.553s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that this is something that this community should really pay close attention to because there's a machine that's going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4000.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: there's a system in place and people have to see what's happening with our council in the direction they've been moving to, whether it was, you know, transfer tax, whether it's fees for a registry, whether it's an override, whether it's a homeowner exemption now and looking at rent control possibly in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4020.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a lot that this city is gonna be moving to if people don't realize and get more involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4028.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This administration, like my colleague said has done a, at least from what I gather, she was saying she was saying that they've done a terrible job, really preparing this community, and what avenues we can take to give us the best choices possible, both in a, a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4047.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a speedy override discussion without the input and without the proper timing during the budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4056.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now here we go with the assessment and the levy that we have to look at, look at homeowner exemption as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4065.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I appreciate what my colleagues have said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4069.361s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's something that we can't do anything today, but it's something that we, I think, have to look at early.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4078.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: earlier in the season now, when we get to the budget season to make sure we have enough money in the overlay to make sure that if we have that 49.9% of homeowners that apply for the exemption, that we can cover that cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4091.48s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, thank you for everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4574.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4687.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Motion to not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=414.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=415.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And thank you for my fellow colleagues to add me to this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=419.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it speaks volumes for me as a school team member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=423.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was part of that group that was first initiated with the thought of, hey, there's a program that we really want to start here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=432.969s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's called Crew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=434.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we didn't have a slip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=436.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't have any docks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=438.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't have a boathouse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=439.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't have anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=441.073s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we were borrowing skulls from different<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=444.77s">[Scarpelli]</a>: different colleges and they were donating them to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=447.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it really started so and you know, it's just a fad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=451.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I what you realize is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=455.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: committed young people really drove this when we first started it to where we are today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=460.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think it's so amazing that we have state champions in front of us right now with committed coaches and kids looking to go to the next level, colleges, universities, and participate in crew at that level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=474.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's just amazing feet and see where we've gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=476.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you know what, I'll say it here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=477.827s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've talked to a bunch of parents that I work in recreation and one of the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=481.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the most attractive pieces of our puzzle in Somerville is our boathouse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=490.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we can do, we have summer programs using rowing crew and the different avenues of community that crew really brings to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=501.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll say it publicly, I would love to see the mayor<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=507.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: use our CPA money to look down the line to building us a true boathouse over at home else stadium I think that, to me, would be full circle and look at something that you know we have an avenue, we have a funding mechanism in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=521.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now all we need is a reason for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=524.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you've given us this reason tenfold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=526.105s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I want to congratulate all of you coaches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=529.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that Mr. Maloney was in the forefront years ago when people told him that this wasn't going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=534.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe if maybe some people remember, when we first started, they put a couple of rowing machines<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=542.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in what's now the boys locker basketball locker room in the gym.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=546.723s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it still there do you guys still use that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=549.105s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was like that's all we had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=550.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had four, and people were just taking turns, jumping in so we've gone a long way so I commend all of you for pushing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=559.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's amazing when you listen to other people from different communities, when they talk about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=565.692s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What Medford crew is doing at the regard is and what they're doing at different events, and how you're seeing sportsmanship and and pride in community and this is what it's all about, you know, in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=577.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Traditionally, it was what hockey, football, baseball, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=581.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now you're seeing lifetime sports where you're seeing people using crew to go to the next level in academia, and then taking that to the next level and really promoting something that's really healthy and positive in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=596.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know I'm winded, but I just wanted to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=599.961s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had the vision when this came forth of when this started, when I was on the school committee and seeing where it is today, just amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=608.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I like so much pride with all the medals on our athletes and coaches standing there stoically and I appreciate all this hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=616.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you and congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=816.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Cullohan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1349.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1350.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It truly was the victory, the first time greater Boston League champion since the early 90s.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1358.047s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First time announced tonight, first time we've had a greater Boston League MVP and Justin Marino.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1365.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So many kids now coach Curley and his coaching staff ascending off to play at the next level that you have, and you're talking about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1374.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a group of kids that without football wouldn't have an opportunity to get to the next level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1378.923s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what's amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1381.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I really want to stress is how impressed I am with the football program for what they do for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1389.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you see the wins and Thanksgiving, that's great, touchdowns, and everybody's happy about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1394.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I find more amazing is what they did the week before when they went to the shelter and they<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1402.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They prepared a couple of the, what am I thinking, Zach?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1411.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The food, it wasn't the meals, they were doing the different community centers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1420.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, so they really, the pantry, excuse me, thank you for helping me with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1424.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But they were setting up the food pantries and helping with stock and share and present that to the community members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1433.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You'll see them this winter, delivering, shoveling seniors out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1440.059s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what you're seeing right now is a true champion in the sense that, forget about the wins and losses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1447.99s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Coach for 32 years, you seldom remember those truly what they're going to remember is what they did as a team and as a family as being part of a community and really giving back to the community so I congratulate coach curly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1463.221s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Chris Murphy, who's the President of the Mustang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1467.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: football program and what they do for our community and give them back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1471.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I would love to invite them to our next meeting, if we can, Mr. President, to them and our next guests and the band and really celebrate what they've done, both on the field and off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1483.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's equally important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1484.66s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1830.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll share, I'll share, I'll share with everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2161.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had some phone calls after and I think that the biggest concern was the private process of tree removal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2170.437s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Residents were really concerned with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2172.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: their freedoms and what they have control on their properties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2175.912s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that at the time KP law did say that that could be viewed as taking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2181.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that that's something that will be reviewed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2184.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that as people ask me, this is the process, it's gonna be vetted through the process and we'll get a clearer understanding as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2192.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for that, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2443.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2445.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see, is Mr. Silva here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2447.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2448.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2449.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2451.681s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe this is just a carry over from the previous owner who his family had owned it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2461.543s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The Calais family owned the donut shop for many, many years, a fixture in the Mefford community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2470.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm so happy that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2473.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Silva stepped up and kept this location alive because it is something that I remember when I was a kid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2485.541s">[Scarpelli]</a>: After church, dad would go over to Demet's and pick up the healthy donuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2492.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They weren't the bad ones at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2495.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I appreciate the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2499.169s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Looks like everything, Mr. President, is in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2503.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, I think the only questions we have is, you know, the number of employees, the hours are staying the same, and that would be it on my end, but I don't see anything that would prohibit us to move this forward after my colleagues share any thoughts, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2596.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we just, honestly, if we have any other questions, this is a pretty straightforward petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2603.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everything is in order, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2604.967s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2606.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If Mr. Silva can add anything, maybe reach out to the clerk for a next meeting, but I don't want to hold this up any longer if it's something that's just technical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2635.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It is a change of ownership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2636.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Seems like just a change of ownership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2679.761s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Should ask for an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2795.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just one question to the attorney while we have the hours of operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2800.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you continue those with us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2810.308s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2810.868s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that sometimes when they go outside that I just would like to remind the petitioner that if it's later that that had to go through the process as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2820.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, Mr. President, I see everything in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2824.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm excited that we don't have an empty storefront and we see a responsible owner coming in and taking over and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2834.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And like I said, everything's in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2838.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would move for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2839.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My colleagues have any comments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2277.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2281.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate all your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2285.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that presentation was great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2287.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that I'm going to be the person that people call because they're nervous about what they hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2293.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what's good is that we're having meetings so we can express the rumors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2304.236s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the fact that they're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2306.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: being permitted, we're going to look at zoning for 12 stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2310.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's nice to see that's not going to happen on Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2314.244s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We appreciate all your hard work with that and making sure that that message is out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2319.107s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that when we talk to residents from that corridor, the biggest concern they have, not just the people on the main drag, but on the budding streets, is making sure that we have parking, making sure that they're seeing different<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2335.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: different processes that are happening that are taking parking away from a business district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2341.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's one of the things there, you know, the business owners that I've talked to this weekend, they were really concerned about that because they're all small businesses and it's very important that, although we can hope that it's just gonna be a walkable transit, public transit corridor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2360.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the truth of the matter is that's not necessarily true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2363.367s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So having an open mind when we look at what the total community looks for, I appreciate my colleagues doing a better job, I think, and getting the word out, but I will share with you that there is still the need to put that comprehensive plan that we asked for in the RFP to go into the Salem Street neighborhood and have those neighbors that can't come here or join us on Zoom<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2386.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that want to really get involved and understand what happens in that quarter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2391.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that you're seeing this, you're seeing fractions of the community right now where neighborhoods are rallying and creating neighborhood groups and getting attorneys and fighting zoning everywhere because the truth of the matter is there isn't enough, there is enough information that's out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2413.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's nice to say that there are people getting it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2416.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: there are a lot of people that aren't getting information on what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2419.172s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, I mean, I try to do my best and I'll share this information for the people that have reached out to me and said, George, we're concerned 12 stories on Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2428.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, this is easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2429.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's no such thing as 12 stories on Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2432.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but you know, it's nice to see that looking at pieces like the MBTA area where maybe redeveloping that area where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2444.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it made Salem Street look like such an eyesore as a, you know, gateway to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2450.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I think that that's when you see successful zoning changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2454.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You see neighbor communities really using the gateway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2457.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the communities is really enhancing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2459.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that we have some limitations for businesses that are there, but I'm glad to see that we're looking at, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2471.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: being responsible to our neighbors and our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2474.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm excited to see a change on Salem Street where we have mixed-use areas and we're seeing more storefronts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2482.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're seeing more families walking that corridor and looking at, you know, having little pockets of, you know, sitting areas with fountains and, you know, but I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2493.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now that we've seen it, and we know all the hard work that we put forward with this, is that really getting the true message out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2500.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's all I'm saying, because I'm saying that, you know, in other situations that we're seeing in the community, where there is concerns that they're going to an extreme, you're seeing some pretty extreme things happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2512.362s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is so good and so new that I think we really have to find other avenues to reach<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2520.962s">[Scarpelli]</a>: more of our residents in that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2523.584s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whatever we have to do, I know that, you know, I know Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2526.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hunt you've explained and it's tough that other communities have big, big departments and we have a small department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2532.731s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2533.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why when we talked with the last council, we really stressed the fact that no matter what it took in the mayor's office for the city to put that into the RFP where our zoning partners can come in and bring teams in just like neighboring communities have done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2548.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like I said, as we're moving forward, I love the clarity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2552.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see it, but I think that there are a lot of people that don't see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2556.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's the biggest concern right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2559.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because it's great if everybody rallies around this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2561.98s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It makes everything a lot smoother, believe me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2565.722s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate your work, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1605.862s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, thank you, uh, uh, gentlemen chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1608.743s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate first your assistance and these endeavors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1612.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that, uh, to be clear, I think that not to confuse everybody, but this is, this is what the conjunction with the, um, the charter committee that's been working so hard throughout the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1623.709s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't, I know that I had a question with, uh, just a text that the message text message saying, is this different?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1629.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I said, no, it's, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1631.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is all conjunction, so this is a big team effort and making sure that we're putting the best product out and making sure that we have the best information moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1640.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we send this off to the state house that we're all in 1 breath.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1644.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, I just wanted to clarify that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1647.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, and then, uh, if I can having the gentleman at the podium this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1653.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Frank Wright, one of the most well-respected city auditors that I've ever worked with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1658.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I really appreciate his presence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1660.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then Frank, if you need a job, Method's looking for a city solicitor and we could do anything you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1667.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=2599.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3191.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Madam Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3193.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate all the hard work and a lot of the questions that I really have is really based on just the information that I'm getting from residents and there are some that are very easy for me to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3208.041s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh explained to to eliminate some fear and and and and rumors that were going around and I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3216.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was wondering if if our friends from Ennis can just have you ever been given a request because a resident asked and I said I I would reach out<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3225.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh for for city councilors and for uh people that have been educated when it talks about zoning and it's it's easy to follow but have have you ever been requested from a community that you've worked with to try to maybe simplify some of these definitions and maybe a bullet point<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3246.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: type of report where where this meeting when they we talk about parking and understanding the offsets when it you know the biggest fear i'm here i give you a good example is the situation that we're dealing with and with tufts university and a 10-story building and how it affects residential homes and it's it's it's clearly defined in this process when we see the the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3275.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the changes that we're looking at and how the residential area, we won't see those types of drastic changes where some residents are fearful for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3292.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So have you ever been requested, and this would be my request, that after a report is given like we've put together tonight, very thorough, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3303.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to without embarrassing or disrespecting anyone, have you ever been asked to put together a bullet point that really simplifies what was discussed today so just the average person can read and understand the basic points that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3321.318s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have gone through because I, I think this is where it's overwhelming and this is where people I know council beers and council vice president and our director have put together an extensive plan to make sure that we're reaching our communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3336.488s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I've been standing on my soapbox and really saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3340.41s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, bringing our meetings to the neighborhoods where people can ask these simplified questions, because I think a lot of people that have reached out to me are a little intimidated by the language and this format, which I believe we can all agree to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3354.519s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, again, if there's any way that we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3358.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: some sort of a format that can be simplified so people can understand what the major changes are and what the processes are, I think would be super helpful if you can help with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3371.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3414.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think the diagrams have been super helpful that because that's one thing that is really simplified that I hate to say it, but to show people pictures with what the changes will be made it very simple to explain to some people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3429.534s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I appreciate that council vice president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3606.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cCFTFy23gjY&t=761.948s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=796.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=798.297s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when you talk about, imagine doing anything for 40 years, how impressive that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=804.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what Barbara has endured for 40 years at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=810.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The beginning is a library, it's running a library and then a subpar library, then a failing library with ceilings caving in and then going through the process of a new library and maintaining an opportunity in pilot libraries across the city and working together with former City Council President Caraviello to bring to fruition a new library in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=838.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a cornerstone now, a great piece of our Medford Square entrance, and to see what Barbara has given to our community, something needs to be commended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=850.851s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, if I could, I would recommend, Council President, that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=854.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have Barbara here at one of our upcoming meetings so we can present her with a citation with appreciation for all of our hard work for the citizens and the residents of Medford and working at our Medford Public Library for 40 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=869.805s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Very impressive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=870.526s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Barbara, for all your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1154.494s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I found them in the order of approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1784.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1785.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1786.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm glad that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1791.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would welcome that we go, we revert this to a committee of the whole meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1795.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that when you're talking something about in the process of a $25 million project, I think this is where we need to sit down before we vote on anything and just look into the finances and what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1807.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: where we're going in our community and where we are since the override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1811.278s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that there are big questions out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1814.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What are we still doing with the fire department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1816.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What are we doing with the new high school if that comes down the line?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1819.563s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How much money will we be able to bond?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1821.504s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it'll be interesting to get those questions answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1823.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to approve $5 million not knowing, with some clarity for the other $20 million, I think that would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1829.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that would be irresponsible for us to move that forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1833.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would recommend that we move this completely to a committee of the whole meeting so we can look at the different options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1839.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know there's been some talk that there's been some money freed up from ARPA due to the override success.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1846.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it'd be interesting to see if we can use other avenues to look into possible ways to fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1853.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know it's needed, not saying that I wouldn't support it, but I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1858.768s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for one council, and we're talking about being stewards of our budgetary process, I think it's important that we sit down and evaluate the whole financial process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1868.634s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's nice that the school committee voted 7-0 because they should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1873.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They want everything fixed, but they don't control the budgetary process, and I think it's important that this council really understands our whole, because I believe we talked about this too, Council President, is understanding our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1887.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: capital plan and understanding where we're going with that capital plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1891.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would recommend, I appreciate your thoughts and your leadership, but I would recommend we go directly to community to the whole with this process from beginning to end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1901.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2552.29s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2553.05s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can you hear me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2554.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2555.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can just see social media today saying, quote, Councilor Scarpelli doesn't want to keep the kids warm and the teachers cool in the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2562.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So let's be realistic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2565.737s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's number one priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2567.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We all know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2568.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we also want to make sure that when I taught there 15 years ago, we had the same issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2574.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we understand that have to get done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2575.903s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what I'm saying is I don't see a few weeks<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2579.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to track back and really understand the total process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2582.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, all due respect, Tom, thank you for your presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2585.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't even know who you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2585.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we paying you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2587.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like we don't, there's processes like, you know, how is the procurement process look?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2593.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How are we going to, has issues with the MSBA been approved yet for 25 million?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2600.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2600.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: have we looked at other avenues do we look at the trajectory of our city's finances when we're looking to how we're going to bomb this so i think that this is this isn't something that we're saying at least this council saying that i don't want this this is council wants to just bring it back and look at this in totality not because the city school committee voted seven nothing because we have issues like the air condition is not going to work in august<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2625.196s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a few weeks that we slow things down and go through the process the correct way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2629.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's to see the full health of our financial future here in the city of Medford because I'd like to know, there might be more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2637.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There might be more that we don't know about because this is coming up<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2641.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we have to look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2641.803s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have to look at what's relatively new and how quick this is and how much it's going to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2644.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Where as we look forward, there might be more that the mayor has has planned, but we don't know about that says, Well, there's another five million that we have to look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2652.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the kids can go into a safe school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2654.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe something's wrong with the doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2656.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know yet because we haven't been discussing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2659.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All we received is this this motion for a loan order and to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2669.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: my council vice president bring that forward and was seconded, but I won't be supporting it for the fact that I'd rather have the meeting before we put five, move $5 million that we can start the process before we know truly what our fiscal overview looks like in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2685.664s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Cause that's something that's been questioned multiple times in the last few months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2690.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4190.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Can we hear papers 24-518, 24-519 please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4218.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4219.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't say just it's been on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4306.621s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4308.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thanks for allowing this to go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4309.922s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that as we've spoken about in the past, I think that with the passing of the override, I think every dollar that is going to come through the city coffers I'm going to bring forward because of the lack of transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4325.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You'll see that there's a trend tonight as we look at different resolutions that lack of transparency or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4336.027s">[Scarpelli]</a>: lack of information for our residents to understand the process as we move forward have been a big issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4343.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that understanding phone calls I received as soon as we get the news that the superintendent's contract has just been bought out, and mutually, by the way, I don't know what that means, but when you have someone for a contract,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4361.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: so especially someone that's worked so hard for the community you'd want to see that to the end and i think that not knowing what that that number is that dollar number is and how much these ramifications are going to hit our community i think it's important when you have all these questions about the override and where the money's going where it's truly going and as the mayor said she would have a transparent process i'm just moving this forward to ask that we get a detailed report from the mayor's office<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4388.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, uh, describing the cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4392.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um impact that's going to hit this city by paying off a superintendent, um, to go home now and, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4403.399s">[Scarpelli]</a>: collective paycheck to do nothing while we're now moving an assistant superintendent forward an interim role and what that cost will be in the trickle down effect to costs that are going to have to now pick up her slack financially in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4417.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4419.005s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't a secret.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4421.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hope no one here is offended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4422.987s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I told everybody here I will question every single penny moving forward, especially after the override vote and anything that would be a little questionable when it comes to processes that as soon as the override is passed, we settle a buyout for a superintendent to move her out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4442.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that is going to be super important that we have that, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4447.339s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I request that from our administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4451.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The second is I'm glad to hear that Mia did respond back to us about our bond rating for Moody's that people didn't know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4462.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we were taken off the bond rating by Moody's, one of our investment companies that give us our bond rating because of some technical issues with filing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4474.78s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe I was told, I'm not sure, but I think that we're here that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4480.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that is back on, we're back on top and our bond rating has been restored.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4484.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's also good to know that we truly don't use Moody's too often or if any, when we look at our bonds, but I think it's important that when something goes out, especially when we're talking about what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4496.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: financial mismanagement, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4498.801s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what do we hear?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4499.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All of a sudden, Moody's has dropped Medford because of A, B and C. So I appreciate the mayor's response today, letting us know that that has been restored.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4510.692s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I would amend this paper, if we could, to ask a report to be presented to the City Council on the reasoning why<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4518.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we would lose a bond rating, because I think that's more alarming in totality to not just getting the bond back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4527.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think, yay, we got it back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4528.855s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think what's important, we talk about the issues we had, especially during the time of the override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4533.959s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about mismanagement of our city's finances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4536.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that we need to see if we can, Mr. President, to amend the paper to ask for that report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4545.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4547.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Next is to be resolved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4549.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The city administration cease and desist the use of private investigators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4553.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was told that we have had multiple employees that under contract are being followed by private investigators, and this is getting to be a real problem because what's happening in our community, whether you want to see it or not,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4570.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our community is being divided in so many different levels, and the administration is the catalyst behind this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4576.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're seeing practices of following hard-working members of our community off of rumors to follow them around the Commonwealth to see if they're doing something wrong during their contractual sick days, and that's wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4594.085s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sure everybody here has said and they fight for unions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4596.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if you truly fight for unions, I hope you stand with me to get a true indication of where our tax dollars are going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4603.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if these rumors again, the reason why we hear the mayor is sent out private investigators because of rumors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4610.73s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I as one Councilor, if we're going to play that game, I am now responding to rumors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4617.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that I want to report back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4618.983s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If this is a practice, I need an update and understand the cost that's attributed to these these, um, these private investigators and where what line item they're coming from and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4633.241s">[Scarpelli]</a>: want a full report, what this practice, how much it's cost us from the beginning to the end, and if they have found anything dealing with any private investigators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4642.427s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that, you know, we have one DPW member that's now gone, that has settled for a big number, that's, he's home now, counting his money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4651.953s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that was one of the instances that, looking back, I'd love to see what it's cost us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4657.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I'm gonna bring it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4660.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had an override, $500,000 to fix all of our streets and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4665.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, let's see where this money is going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4667.459s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think this is important that we see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4669.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And last but not least, what I heard the other day, I find it appalling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4673.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that this is, again, another example of the division of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4680.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody wants that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4681.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What do we have the other day?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4682.993s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have DPW members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4684.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We were commending DPW members because of their hard work and their commitment to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4690.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But in the same breath, we're gonna hear that in this resolution that just the other day, I was informed that I believe 45 DPW members, staff members were brought in to do drug testing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4707.742s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's a blatant<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4709.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: blatant problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4712.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my question that I can ask right now is how much did it cost us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4716.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what do we find with these these these processes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4721.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I think it's important that we need to know because these members that are here are the people that get up every day and go to work without any question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4729.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now they're understaffed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4731.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're underpaid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4733.266s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are the people that, remember, we plotted because, what, while everybody was sleeping and doors were shut and everything was buckled down during the pandemic?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4742.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, they were fired, there were police, and there were DPW workers that were killing themselves every single day for this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4748.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know the mayor talks about the pandemic, and we want to talk about it when it sounds good, but these men and women, what happened last week, that's a serious problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4756.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And for one member of this leadership team in this city, I think that we have to have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4762.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: emotion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4763.079s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have to have information that stops this from happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4766.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Enough is enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4768.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our city is damaged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4769.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our state is damaged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4770.788s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our nation is damaged as it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4772.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't need any more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4775.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that there is a representative here from the Teamsters that's represented the union that could explain some important information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4781.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I welcome that when it's time, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4784.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I think it's important for this council right now to understand this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4789.158s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we all know that, you know, we can't come from the city because of personnel issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4793.319s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I will tell you what I can ask for is what the funding what it costs this this community by I believe it was drug testing and alcohol testing, I believe, for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4805.783s">[Scarpelli]</a>: all of the city employees that were, by the way, working on our streets, in our schools, in our parks, on our sidewalks, that were called back to the yard, that had to sit in a room and then be embarrassed and disgraced to get drug tested for no reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4825.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, Mr. President, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4948.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4948.603s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, Clarity, you're saying the mayor says that so to ask for a a report from the school department, is she is she saying that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4959.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are we going to get a report financially so we can understand the ramifications financially for buying out the superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4966.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that you have nothing to do with it, but did she give you any indication?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4969.298s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because to me it sounds like, you know, go pound sand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4972.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're moving on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4981.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As the budgetary stewards of this community that vote on that budget,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4986.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm demanding a report, Council President, if you may, to the mayor to break down the financial ramifications of the buyout to the superintendent and what that means to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4998.744s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5079.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5079.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't want to get the tip of tap, but as the mayor just said in her response, when you hear a rumor, she takes up full responsibility to make sure we know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5090.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As fiscal stewards of this community, when the city council, when the school committee mutually ends a contract, and yes, there is a bio with it, there is a financial<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5103.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a financial responsibility to the city by the superintendent leaving early.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5108.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why I'm asking for the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5110.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why I'm asking the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5111.971s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not asking for anything bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5113.032s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not saying anybody did anything wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5114.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All I'm asking for is a report so we can see what the financial ramifications are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5120.655s">[Scarpelli]</a>: by having this buyout, not just with the superintendent, whatever it costs us, if it costs us anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5125.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They come back and say it costs us nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5127.718s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what is it going to cost us for an interim?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5130.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What's that increase?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5132.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What is the trickle-down effect?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5133.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who's going to take up those responsibilities?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5135.201s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who's going to pay those people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5137.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Are they going to get paid?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5138.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't think this is something that's very confusing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5141.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This, believe me, this is pretty clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5144.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when I asked for a resolution, the resolution doesn't seem to be too dumbfounding, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5149.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's pretty self-explanatory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5151.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All this council is asking for, ladies and gentlemen, is just a report on the breakdown of the mutual buyout or the mutual dismissal of the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5161.093s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5165.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not trying to make this more than it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5370.223s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just think that, I think I'll say it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5372.725s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I, and I, for what this community has just gone through in November,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5378.331s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's important that we do question everything because everybody's asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5384.873s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So either it's on the city side, school side, it comes, it's coming out of our city's budget and there are questions that aren't being asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5393.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when residents come to me and say, what are the implications financially, especially after an override, it just doesn't smell right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5401.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why I'm saying these are the, these are the important things that all that is, is just,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5405.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: showing the information, understanding the information moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5409.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we talk about accountability, don't you think it's about time that the mayor is held accountable?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5414.953s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, don't we think that this administration is held accountable?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5419.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5421.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So she's getting a free pass by hiding behind different levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5427.28s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the bottom line is enough is enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5429.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to fix this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5431.643s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6874.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, Mr. President, I think that if I can have the representative from local 25<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6882.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that part of this process, I think that there was a clear trend in meaning behind my resolutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6891.92s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know it was something that's horrible and it's something that would be vetted out properly in the courts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6900.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that what was clear is making sure that our community understood a few things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6908.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is one, we get a report that breaks down the funding mechanism and how money's being spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6914.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the first thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6916.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The second thing is that understanding the process that our leadership in this community in the mayor's office is lacking and it's causing a huge divide in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6927.335s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, we've talked about the police today, 900 days without a contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6931.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're talking about the firefighters having some serious issues right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6936.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, and then right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6937.864s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what we're talking about right now is what I need to know is how much just this one is an issue cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6945.166s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then you brought up a good point, Mr. Hatch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6946.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You said that, you know, how many communities do you work with?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6950.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you can, can you, what, what are they?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6952.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you can, do you know what, what communities...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6978.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, I think that the question I need to ask you, you've obviously represented those communities and you've had leaders in those communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6988.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is it an anomaly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6990.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is this a trend that we're seeing just because we're in Medford, we're isolated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=6993.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know by working in a municipality for the last 18 years, I see the difference, but most people don't understand that some people actually come to the city of Medford say, this is the norm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7005.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what a mayor is supposed to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7007.475s">[Scarpelli]</a>: can you just shed just a little light on your experience and your other communities?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7013.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you see the same trends and do you see the same financial impact to their communities that we're seeing here in Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7083.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: OK, so that's my final question is this, because this is what the point is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7088.168s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The amount of money we spent on drug testing and breathalyzers for these employees is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7094.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wanna see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7096.191s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I would love to see the cost that to the Teamsters, because we're not getting the true indication of what the city is paying for our attorneys, because we don't have a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7105.635s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would like, if you can, if you could report back to the council and just give us an idea of what the Teamsters pay, their council,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7114.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and fighting method issues, because that will at least give us a true indication that in the last five and a half years, we've seen that the teams have paid X amount of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7126.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And from what I gather, it should be pretty equivalent to see where our money is going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7131.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I'm bringing this forward to the community so we can understand a major impact to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7137.281s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I bring up the override every time because we talk about mismanagement of funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7142.569s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when we have the representatives of 14 other communities, and we hear that this doesn't happen anywhere else, that's a red flag.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7151.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I know what was happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7153.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't like it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7155.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We stand against it 1,000% as human beings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7158.762s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But truly, the intent for this resolution is really to understand, A, the financial impact that we're seeing in all of my other resolutions I put in place, and then B, again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7171.696s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the lack of true transparency and true leadership with the mayor of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7177.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7179.579s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I apologize that things are getting heated again, but I know it's something that's very emotional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7186.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I talked to at least 10 DPW workers that call me directly that I've grown up with, I've been friends with, that were absolutely appalled and embarrassed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7194.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Their wives called me and said, this is a disgrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7197.647s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What my husband had to endure today was a disgrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7201.776s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I can't speak to that more than I can, or I wish I could because I would have called the city solicitor and asked him how far I can go with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7210.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I know that you have put forth the civil rights lawsuit, I believe against the mayor and against the city, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7217.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's going to be interesting to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7219.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, another financial impact to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7223.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7236.752s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That'll be interesting, because I know that this administration, what they love to do is they like to come back and say, oh, in Everett, they pay this much, and in Malden, they pay this much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7246.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'd like to see is what you pay out to fight issues legally with Everett, with Melrose,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7255.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Chelsea with Cambridge, just to get a true indication how poorly mismanaged this community is when it comes to fiscal transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7428.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's talking about when we talk about when you're voting on funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7433.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't a financial paper voting on funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7436.538s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a resolution asking for financial documents that are spent by the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7441.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're not asking for spending money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7443.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's a negative way to get out of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7446.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I tell you, I'm embarrassed that that just happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7486.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't a finance paper, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7489.058s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a resolution asking for not to fund a finance paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7494.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's to ask, inquire of how much was funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7498.586s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That has nothing to do with financial intent for the rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7502.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And you know what it is, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7504.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I don't know why we're doing this on a phone show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7506.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're smarter than this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7507.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Don't embarrass this council like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7509.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is nothing to do about calling for rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7513.487s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're talking about moving money forward in a financial resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7518.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is not the intent of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7519.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Please don't do this again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7546.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7886.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It seems like it's kind of a no-win scenario for the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8437.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Villes isn't wrong that the line item for the legal department is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8442.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the warrant articles that we have, I'll give you an example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8445.638s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have them all right here because I have them ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8448.82s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And from month to month, I could break it down with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8452.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm coming with you tomorrow, Mr. Jones, and I'll show you, I'll give you an example right off the bat, which was alarming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8457.187s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In June of 2023,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8460.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the city of method paid KP law through the warrant articles, not in the law, not in the law item in different, different departments over $230,000 just for that one month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8471.317s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will come and I'll share this information with you just to see council bears isn't wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8476.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The line item for the legal department isn't, they take exactly what they're supposed to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8480.084s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8481.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the Warren articles that we get month to month, you could see the breakdown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8485.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You could see the expenditures to KP law for different departments for hundreds of thousands of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8612.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But he said rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8613.211s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8613.811s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm glad you figured out what you made a mistake by when I invoked rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8623.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8624.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8913.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If that would help to get the information that we're looking for, I would be amenable to changing the language so we can get some information through the administration to see if these are the practices and if they are where we stand as a council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8929.518s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would be willing to make those amendments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9310.657s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you want to look at this process and make sure that the wording is correct, just to get some information, the truth of the matter is just understanding the cost impact on drug tests for DPW employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9336.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and report back what our drug policies are for all city employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9340.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9447.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9448.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think the union representative was very clear in the process and the policies when to be drug tested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9454.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, regardless what the federal laws are, but there are agreements and laws that were made, uh, in, in negotiation to make sure that these weren't violated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9465.58s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that the mayor has that, uh, to be honest with you, that would be very clear and understandable for everybody here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9472.883s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Cause she definitely violated that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9616.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Council asked for when we had the the chief chief Evans here when we talked about the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9627.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the report then was presented to the deputies and the chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9631.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we were waiting on a meeting to inform the council of what their findings were with that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9647.922s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9656.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they would be included in that executive session because you're bringing them in to discuss personal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9662.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They have to be there for talking about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9663.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's the intent of executive session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9698.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9701.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the second piece, Council President, if you want to leave it open-ended, after consulting the legal team, that we then have the ability to go to executive sessions so they see fit, or they deem it approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9778.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that the process that this council's totality voted to fund this report and having an open forum, having the report presented to the public and then go to executive session through open meeting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9798.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but as a committee, a committee, a meeting with all the, all the members of this council, because they think that committee of the whole versus the public health and safety committee, I'd rather, I'd rather that if that was the option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9834.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9834.521s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=9835.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10022.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that I know that had a great discussion with our director, that there were some questions with the process of notification in our processes through the city council, whether they were done legally, and they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10043.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unfortunately, the software that we have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10045.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When the resolution is opened and moves forward, it's not written out in totality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10051.045s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So people didn't see that tonight's would be the final vote for Mystic Ave rezoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10059.672s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're informed that the process was done correctly and that if there is a way that we can look in the future to try to share that information to make sure that there aren't any questions moving forward, I think that'll be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10647.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's in height, not stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10652.432s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the recommended is height though, and best practice is height?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10664.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it shows both?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10672.681s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10770.285s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just, I know that we've been, I'm going to be redundant and I know that this is my, my cry from the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10776.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, and I know the director has tried and we've, we've talked about this and informing the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10782.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we've done, um, you know, what you feel is due diligence, but I'm going to stick with what, what this council prior really wanted to see was really bringing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10794.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: these meetings to the neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10796.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I did talk to residents of the corridor and business owners, and I know that you've corrected me a few times and said, George, we put it in the water bill, we've gone directly to the businesses, but the members that have reached out to me, the neighbors that I've talked to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10816.451s">[Scarpelli]</a>: truly don't understand the process still.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10818.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that there are some restrictions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10820.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, when you look at our zoning process, we still, we're only Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10824.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that really hurts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10826.296s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So people really can't get involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10828.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think, again, I think this is my biggest battle is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10835.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we're moving forward, I really would like to see us go into the neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10838.474s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know Innes said they would look to see if it's possible to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10841.736s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that that was part of the RFP that I read that we looked at back in the day when we first started this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10846.818s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I just think that's important, especially when you're making these changes that we haven't done in 100 years, that residents feel like they've been listened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10856.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we've done a lot of listening sessions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10859.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've had a lot of meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10860.843s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I think that that last piece, I feel, is a big void.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10864.878s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we need to go to the neighborhood, and I'm gonna stand on my soapbox to the end with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10870.121s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12381.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're gonna be sick of hearing me tonight, but we see everything in its order, Mr. Rafferty, and I really drove by today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12388.483s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The front door looks amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12390.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's really inviting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12391.565s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm so happy that you're gonna have Saria A games there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12395.087s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's so funny that- Yes, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12396.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12397.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12398.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I see everything, so I move approval as long as my fellow colleagues have no other questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13225.876s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13226.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First, I want to thank Barry and Marie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13232.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: having a conversation and really having an open dialogue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13236.168s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that we expressed a lot of information about this ordinance and having my support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13243.353s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that my biggest concern are two basic issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13247.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one thing I'll ask is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13250.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as I get started is I'd like to see this to be tabled so we can sit with the chief because I don't think that we've had a conversation with the chief and understand the impacts with the police department when we make an ordinance and how it could conflict with the city ordinance and what his job requires him to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13269.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that he, you know, I think that that's, you know, the understanding that the ACLU, the support and the involvement of the ACLU has left some residents questioning, you know, their beliefs in what policing is and what this means with this ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13287.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13290.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the understanding the slippery slopes when we talk about, we talk about this, this ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13296.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I've talked to the chief and I've talked to city officials, when chief Sacco put together the federal immigration enforcement plan and really put this in place, you know, they shared that, you know, the number one priority is our community safety and comfort of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13312.131s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think it's important because I think this is very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13315.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think I can sit here<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13320.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and attest that as a city councilor, I've sat in a house, I've stood in a house with six ICE agents and a family of undocumented members of a community and, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13332.6s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know the fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13333.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13334.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I also think that when we move something toward an ordinance, I think we need to do our due diligence and make sure that we really have the information and we're all coming into this as a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13345.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I talked to the chief and the chief has been part of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13350.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a very important piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13351.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that having the chief of police sit down with our body and say, what are some limitations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13359.322s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What are some concerns?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13360.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How do we fix that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13361.763s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How do we express it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13363.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: How do we bring it forward so we can move forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13366.145s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That hasn't been done yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13367.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13368.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think before we move forward, I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13370.607s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that table moving into a meeting to sit with the chief and understand that this is a process so we can all understand what the ramification is as a law enforcement officer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13380.591s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because we don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13381.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're doing something that means well, and we want to do something to protect people, which is good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13387.213s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think we're talking about an ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13388.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we need all the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13390.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think we have done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13390.914s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the other piece, and I would also like to invite the administration, the financial director, for the other impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13400.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: it is gonna be a different time in a few weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13406.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we've seen it openly discussed how communities that put ordinances or rules in place like this, that the national agenda is to harm us financially with federal funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13421.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we need to also understand that platform.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13424.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, it's not something that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13429.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this council is not supporting for the good reasons, but I think it's important that we get all the information out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13434.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's goodwill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13436.299s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It feels good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13437.02s">[Scarpelli]</a>: People have done some great work and really put a lot of passion into this, and I commend them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13442.665s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I can't support this unless we do our due diligence and sit down with the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13448.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: probably the most important person in this community, the person that actually does our policing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13453.007s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he's always been involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13455.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He's always been welcoming to come sit down with us and share his opinion and see what our police department and what those impacts means when you talk about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13466.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: changing an ordinance to what they do every day by law and how that might be intertwined in a negative fashion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13473.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's something that I'm going to stand with and I hope my colleagues can understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13479.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13782.837s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, I would request that at least you not waive the three readings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13788.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would hate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13791.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just, I, again, I think that I talked to the chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13797.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that it'd be something that it would be fruitful for us to understand the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13802.813s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13803.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, with the last administration, both the house and the Senate now fall<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13810.071s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with one party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13810.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, there's going to be a that's something that when I've talked to my my contacts at the higher level, this is what the fair is now is understanding that there isn't an option to stop the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16976.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16977.253s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you recall, this process was very well vetted by the chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16986.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And there were so many concerns that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16989.136s">[Scarpelli]</a>: he talked about with public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16991.917s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know this was in subcommittee, and we're coming right to the floor with this and understanding that this is clearly politics over public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17004.683s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is frightening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17007.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a process without having the chief involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17010.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's where you're stepping overbound, because I remember those days, he was heavily involved, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17017.907s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to hear that he wasn't part of this because these are some of the things he definitely talked about that helped him keep our residents safe and our community safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17027.554s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I remember that specifically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17029.936s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And him not being here and us just pushing these through, I just think it's wrong right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17035.62s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I wish that you would table this to sit with the chief and have him review this to see the impacts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17042.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, we're seeing what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17043.391s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I, you know, I've talked to neighboring communities and understanding that, you know, I understand the process and the understanding where, um, how it can affect people in a negative way, but the pros outweigh the cons in so many ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17060.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, look how they look, look how they found the murder, the gentleman who killed the, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17068.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in New York City.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17069.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was all by surveillance camera, by following him around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17072.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They took a murder off the street that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17075.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're looking to put into action policies that take away that ability for our police and our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17085.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just think this is stepping over a line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17088.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that, you know, we just don't do this at 12 o'clock at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17094.756s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know, but to do it at 12 o'clock at night and not have the process over just a subcommittee meeting where everybody wasn't privy to it and then come to here today and start moving these ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18492.907s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I too talked to Rocco DiRico.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18494.388s">[Scarpelli]</a>: First, I think we're very fortunate both between Barbara and Rocco and having liaisons from Tufts University that pick up the phone the minute we call them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18503.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's a huge benefit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18506.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I truly believe what our neighbors are saying when you talk about, you know, these different corridors and you look at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18516.383s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, 12 stories, and how frightening that is, and Tufts even conceding to 10 stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18524.387s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I've seen all the concessions that Tufts made, and I've been fortunate enough to be involved with a mayor that was directly involved with Tufts University.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18535.913s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he allowed me to watch him be a partner, but make sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18544.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: his community was present and getting the best with that community needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18549.703s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what's frightening to me is what we see, and I'm gonna be critical and I could care less if anybody cares or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18557.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's 1215, so who cares?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18560.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But when we are talking about this mayor and the process that's been happening since August, and all of a sudden she comes out now, well, she should have been present from the beginning when you talk about our neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18574.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and their impact of the quality of life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18577.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're seeing it all over the community, by the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18580.186s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why the community is now focused on creating groups and paying attorneys and fighting because they don't believe that this administration can fight for their rights and their beliefs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18597.03s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18599.958s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I too disagree with the size of this dormitory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18606.019s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the fact that everybody is focused on housing and how important it is, but I truly don't think it's going to impact the housing like people think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18619.142s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have two kids in college, and the first thing they wanted to do is get out of a dorm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18628.682s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wish that it's gonna open up some housing around that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18632.845s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just don't see it happening, but I also see the impact that this is gonna make for residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18639.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, but again, I did see and had discussions with Mr. DeRico and understanding the information that was put out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18655.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and how many people they touched to make sure that everybody knew about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18658.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One thing you knew in that neighborhood, people knew that Tufts was putting forth this development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18665.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And people were talking about it, but it seemed like nobody was listening until the 12th hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18669.858s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now all of a sudden, we're scrambling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18671.619s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I think the truth of the matter is, if you talk to Tufts University and you said, as much as we love our environmental plan,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18680.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe some concessions would have been made to alleviate some of those big ticket items that could have supported maybe dropping it down to eight stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18691.363s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it wouldn't affected a quarter of the shading for the neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18696.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But there were no discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18698.33s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're coming in right now and hoping that people do the right thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18703.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, when it comes time, I think this community should really wake up and understand what has this administration done in the last five and a half years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18716.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And are you willing to give these people another two years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18719.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because it's not working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18722.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That office is not working for this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18725.487s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20544.537s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20545.518s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, as we start this process, you know, we're now seeing that we're now delving into more residential neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20554.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my request and recommendation would be to hold our next public meeting at the Roberts Elementary School, where it could be a process for all the people that feel that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20568.109s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they haven't been heard, or they feel that they haven't been able to come to these meetings, that we put this meeting into their backyard as requested back when we wrote the RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20579.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I know we've been trying our best to be more transparent and give more people an opportunity to share and be part of the process, but I would truly recommend as a motion that we ask to move<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20595.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: one of the final meetings to the neighborhood directly so we can hear from the neighbors in their backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20604.849s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I would make that as a form of motion if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20611.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20619.796s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whichever, I know that we have, when is that next?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20624.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right after CD, if we can, after that, if we can come back and get some input from the neighbors that we can present that the CB, their ideas and their input, and then really get the neighbors' involvement and at least be part of that final solution and the changes that are gonna be made there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/92ZcNcBM_Nk&t=830.761s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=976.52s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=977.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President for allowing me the opportunity to speak on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=983.061s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh, true legend here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=985.022s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, when we know that Mr. Granada has been fighting a good fight for some time now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=990.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, but when, uh, we sure when God came calling this past week, um, we knew he now has one of the best people Medford ever had to offer to sit by his side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1004.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, Mr. Granada was so entrenched in our community and had so much love and passion for the city that I remember the time when I first started<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1012.759s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the option of running for school committee, I had to go sit with Mr. Granara to get his blessing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1021.082s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not for the fact that he was the God, but it was so important to get his blessing so he can talk to you and explain to you what it truly meant to be an elected official in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1035.646s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He made me understand that the reason why we become elected officials<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1039.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is the work that you are doing for the community, for the residents of the city, not for yourself, not for yourself, anything to gain any self-worth or for you personally, but what's best for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1053.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that when you first hear some of the things, I know that people don't know this, but Mr. Granara was a major factor in the Middlesex Sheriff's Offices and Trevor Katushin<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1065.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: wrote this past week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1066.218s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It is with a heavy heart that I must inform you all the former Special Sheriff John Granara Esquire has passed away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1074.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our thoughts and prayers are with his entire Granara family during this difficult time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1077.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A graduate of Matanon High School, Boston College, Suffolk University Law School, John Granara served the MSO with distinction in the highest levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1086.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He began as the MSO's Chief Legal Counsel in March 1997, serving until 2009 of August.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1093.874s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when he was appointed as Special Sheriff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1096.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Following the passing of the Sheriff Jimmy DePaulo in November of 2010, Special Sheriff Granara ably ran this agency until the appointment of Sheriff Katushin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1107.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Providing leadership at the pivotal time for the Middlesex Sheriff's Office, he was an invaluable source of knowledge, leadership, and friendship to me and many others throughout his tenure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1117.182s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was our great privilege to have him remain as a Special Sheriff until August of 2011.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1122.389s">[Scarpelli]</a>: John's legacy is public service included his time in the method school committee from 74 to 77 and his election to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 76 representing his beloved hometown of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1136.578s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In his memory, the half the flags in Middlesex jails were all lowered to half staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1142.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, I know I read council bears read a few things that Mr. Granada did, but he did every<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1148.223s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He did more than people even knew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1149.724s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There was a lot of things, whether it's a celebration parade in Medford, whether it's supporting different programs that no one knew about, it was Mr. Granauer that did the work behind the scenes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1162.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And he kept a tradition that I thought was so valuable and so needed for our veterans that I believe it was, I said Memorial Day, but I believe it's Memorial Day, not Veterans Day, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1175.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that working together with the members of the American Legion and the Elks, they would have our presentation and he would set a day of remembrance that you had to be there, you couldn't miss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1192.232s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So he was a special individual and someone that this city will miss, but if you've known John Granara, please share a story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1201.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Don't let his,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1204.522s">[Scarpelli]</a>: his work fade away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1207.064s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let that name stick with you, because this is what the city is lacking today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1212.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The reason why you see such divide is because people like John Granara aren't here to bring these groups together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1218.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to the Granara family, we send our deepest condolences, and I'd love to, if we can, leave this meeting in his honor, Mr. President, and thank you for the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1269.34s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1270.761s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Another long time battle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1274.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Evangelista fought hard to be there for his loving wife and his two daughters, like he's always been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1281.524s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And unfortunately,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1283.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: He was taken from us and hopefully is resting in peace now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1289.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the Evangelista family worked so hard, especially Julianne and Lisa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1294.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We all know Lisa, who's worked for the city for many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1298.456s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'd like to say she ran the city while Mike McGlynn was the mayor for those many, many years, and then moved over to the school department for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1308.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and I know that he will be missed and we just share our condolences with Evangelista family, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1330.957s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I found them in the ordering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2299.794s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2301.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you for this initiative I so excited to see this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2304.176s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I can't wait for the involvement of our parents and, and, and really pick your brain and then as a program developer for parks and recreation department, and a neighboring community that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2316.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: is focusing on the enhancement and the growth of our adaptive programming for after school, before school, and during the summers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2325.511s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that during the vacation weeks, I'm so excited that, you know, that we have a group of parents that can kickstart something here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2333.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know I've worked very closely with Kevin and also the directors in Belmont and also in Malden because we find it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2340.641s">[Scarpelli]</a>: very difficult to get programs that were bringing enough enough participants to make it sustainable in the sense not that it's, you know, we've offered to do special programming with, you know, with as free programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2355.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've looked into providing free transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2359.097s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're really excited and looking into trying to do things collaboratively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2362.979s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why I'm so excited tonight to see this, that our parents can share some information that I would love to work with Kevin directly with Somerville and saying, hey, this is a great collaboration where there'll be no boundaries, there'll be no limitations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2378.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I remember we worked closely with, at one time, the only thing that was offered for our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2383.951s">[Scarpelli]</a>: special needs and adaptive families back in the day when I first started as a developer was the top soccer program and it was such an important program and I remember talking to parents as we ran that program through and it was so important for the parents to feel that they want to be soccer moms and dads as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2403.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was just important for the whole family to have these programs and I'm so excited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2407.847s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've worked with Adaptive Sports New England in trying to bring programs to Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2414.529s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One program we're looking to start this coming year is looking to use Dillboy Stadium for our wheelchair accessible track program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2425.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: One thing that I'm working closely with the Special Needs Department and Somerville in trying to find a true partnership that we can really sustain it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2433.159s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that when we've had a program during the summer, and it's an adaptive parks and recreation program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2441.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we would offer that after our students would leave the summer program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2446.209s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it was very accessible, and we made sure we supported in every which way with transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2454.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we found it at times that the numbers weren't there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2457.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that really having a group that can advocate that we can turn to both Kevin and I personally, because I think it'll be a huge success if we collaborate and work together with neighboring communities so we can really help it grow it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2472.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm excited for the fact I've given, I've been given that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2476.721s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that permission from our director in Somerville, that we can really enhance our, our adaptive programming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2484.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so I, again, I could talk a buzz it off me wagon because I'm really excited about this, but I'd love to hear what our parents have to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2491.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, and if there's a way that we can meet after to try to set something up together, that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2496.471s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2498.292s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Hey, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3649.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3649.698s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm so passionate about this because what we're seeing, what I see in a day-to-day situation in my profession<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3658.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I hear it from our parents today and what we're hearing is the the difficult of having something in your own town and I know it's difficult I'd love to do more in the town that I work in the city working but it's sometimes you don't get the numbers that you need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3675.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's why the conversation with Director Levine in Malden and Director Bailey here in Medford, we've been talking about trying to find a collaboration between the triangle, the three of us, and trying to find a way to pool all the assets that we have together so we can have something that parents don't have to drive to Watertown or Burlington or Brookline<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3698.612s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but they stay right in this room and we can offer something and that that's that's something that our kids and families would love.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3708.062s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we have someone here right now that i'll come to the carpet we we've been very fortunate to have the teamsters as part of our family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3716.408s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll be honest with you, whenever I need anything, I would go to the Teamsters organization who works so hard for artistic community, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3723.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they run the artistic gala to help us support programs and they've always done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3728.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So Steve, I'll be calling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3730.575s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that looking as a collaboration, maybe having Mayor Lungo-Koehn and working with Mayor Christensen and working with Mayor Ballantyne and saying, hey, maybe there's somewhere we can go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3742.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It wouldn't be great, something like the Heckner Center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3745.422s">[Scarpelli]</a>: having a central site for our adaptive programming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3750.465s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Park right next door that's enclosed and safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3754.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, we can even across the street, we have St.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3757.268s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Francis has a gymnasium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3759.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we have access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3761.091s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have great people that have worked with our most vulnerable for many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3765.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Ron Giovino has done an amazing job with the Challenger program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3769.938s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And imagine using that to enhance that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3771.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that we have an adaptive physical education teacher at Method High School, and Kala Andre, and she's doing amazing things with the Challenger program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3780.227s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And imagine bringing that to an after school program, bringing that in a Saturday program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3786.115s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think there's so much we can do as a city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3790.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the avenues that we already have and the partners that we already have, I don't think this is a reach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3796.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that what you hear, everybody loves to hear inclusionary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3799.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Oh, we're inclusionary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3801.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I was fortunate enough to start the summer program at the former Columbus, now the Mr. Tuck School, one of the issues is making sure that our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3813.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: special needs community had an avenue for a summer program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3817.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we really, at the time, Superintendent Belson made it a priority that it was open for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3825.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I also understand that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3828.812s">[Scarpelli]</a>: all inclusionary sometimes in some communities mean that all you're doing is saying we're covering you, but really not doing anything for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3836.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm excited just from what I hear and maybe if I could be added to any of the future meetings and maybe bring in Kevin Bailey, we can reach out to Joe Levine over in Malden and see if there's a true collaboration that we can use that, you know, maybe we're doing the basketball program here<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3856.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: at the recreation center, but maybe we're doing our soccer program over at Dillboy Stadium, or maybe we're doing our track program over at McDonald Stadium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3867.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's not that far of a drive, but it's sustainable enough that we can bring families together and have a true program that we can really be proud of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3878.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I find it so difficult to try to run the program in Somerville because it's our number one initiative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3884.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we just not getting the numbers because we have, we have, we have hundreds of parents have hundreds of kids but unfortunately, some can only do some after school here, some can don't have transportation there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3896.604s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Some don't have this will maybe if there's a vibrant program that we have multiple offerings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3903.16s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that maybe we can do something great and I'm excited about moving forward and helping this community and I and I, you know, Medford high did something that's very different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3914.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Most communities don't have an adaptive physical education teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3919.077s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What they do is is a physical education teacher who studied the adaptive program<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3925.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you can cover some because of your experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3928.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But Medford has a teacher that does that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3930.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll be honest with you, Carla ran our summer program for a few years and she was amazing for our recreation program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3936.968s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But there's opportunities there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3939.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So like, again, I'm excited about the process and I agree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3944.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think this is, no one's gonna walk away from this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3947.757s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think this is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3948.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you so much for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4425.343s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4426.123s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, as I said earlier, I thought the presentation was amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4430.325s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand the need as a former teacher, my colleagues, relatives of teaching, family members that are in the schools, we understand that this is a definite need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4441.33s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will be voting no for the simple fact that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4444.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: part of the first reading I asked for a breakdown of our capital plan this is going to be a 20 possibly 27 million dollar project and what I asked for the meeting from the mayor's office was a meeting to discuss our capital capital projects that are in in line also talked about what the future looks like and how this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4466.793s">[Scarpelli]</a>: looking to see how it would affect the renovation or the new high school project moving forward when you're looking for 20 bonding $27 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4474.879s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, you know, the other pieces, the whole, we still need a main street fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4480.562s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there was so many pieces involved with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4482.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I asked to have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4484.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We didn't get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4485.265s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No council beers has tried.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4487.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that he's still having, we will be hopefully having a meeting soon, but, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4492.535s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the hard work that everybody has done, but I'll be voting no because I have not gotten the information to make sure that our community understands the financial impact in totality once we vote this through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4505.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4935.314s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, as I stated in the first meeting, I think it's very important when we started this project, as Councilor Collins mentioned years ago, the police chief and the police department were very involved in helping us craft this ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4951.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For the fact that the police chief was not involved in this process, I will not be supporting this endeavor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4957.444s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4958.924s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Any further discussion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5332.35s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5333.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that I was the friends from Method People Power.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5337.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate the conversation and the respect given in the conversation that we did have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5342.195s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, in discussions with the chief of police and our police department, some of these initiatives can hamper our police department to do their jobs and contradicts some of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5358.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the ordinances that are being put in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5360.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, without the police chief's involvement in this directly, I could not support this for the fact that it might hurt the community more than people think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5372.498s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's something that's already in place in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5376.842s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When I've talked to the chief, I believe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5378.824s">[Scarpelli]</a>: in the years that he's been here, he's always been proactive and involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5382.846s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think he's had interaction with ICE once in the many years, but he thinks, he shared that he wasn't involved in this craft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5394.011s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it might leave us into some questionable findings later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5398.373s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will not be supporting this initiative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5400.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6772.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know this is so people realize Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6774.558s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Lerner has called me a racist for many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6777.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm a first-generation American.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6780.501s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My parents are immigrants from Italy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6782.622s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They came across legally and did exactly what had to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6788.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They love this country, and they raised a proud American.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6793.089s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I worked in a community that's very diverse, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6797.372s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Unlike Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6797.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Lerner, I've sat in a living room with an ICE agent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6802.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and a family of illegal members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6807.713s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I understand the situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6810.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we just had two human rights members just say what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6814.754s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They've worked with the chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6816.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've had the existing plan in place for five and a half years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6819.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's worked amazingly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6821.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what was mentioned last time where people are missing, when Mr. Lerner's talking about money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6829.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My fear at the time was understanding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6832.128s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with the city of Medford and where we are financially, is what are the financial ramifications if there is negative feedback from the federal government?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6843.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if they take money away from Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6847.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, in Cambridge, in Boston, in Somerville, they can survive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6851.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In Medford, I question if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6854.782s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's our basic necessities, police, fire, school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6860.485s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That was my concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6862.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So to sit there and publicly embarrass me, she's already called me racist many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6871.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's uncalled for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6876.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I will share with you the process as I met with many members of these organizations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6883.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would never ever, in the spirit of any of these ordinances, they're very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6891.328s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as a city councilor, we have to weigh many different factors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6897.052s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And because I've done that, I'm labeled a racist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6902.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So shame on you, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6903.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Lerner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6904.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've given my life to this community and the people of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6908.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No matter what color, what race, it doesn't matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6913.342s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it's about time people stand up to the ignorance we just heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=6916.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8468.25s">[Scarpelli]</a>: responses over the last year as we continually struggle to effectively fund our priorities, especially our school priorities due to the cost of inflation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8476.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our administration has continued the process of reviewing department overtime budgets and procedures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8482.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Since February 2024 especially, I've been focusing on OT even more and working with all department heads that have OT line items in their budget to make sure all public funds are being used the best way possible and to make sure there is not misuse or overuse of such funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8501.289s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The city's obligation to fund overtime is necessary to ensure the general public's safety, fulfill contractual obligations, and for the efficient operations of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8510.872s">[Scarpelli]</a>: However, we must be strategic in how the staffing is deployed as the funding resources are extremely limited and there are critical needs throughout our school district and city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8521.155s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Overtime is a crucial component<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8523.075s">[Scarpelli]</a>: of every municipality's budget and operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8526.096s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need DPW crews out on the streets plowing snow, removing trees that block roadways, and other critical tasks to keep our roadways accessible and safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8535.039s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Police and fire OT for several reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8537.5s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In some circumstances, we need building inspectors to be able to visit homes and make determinations on living conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8545.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we need to manage how overtime is allocated so we don't create a situation<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8550.424s">[Scarpelli]</a>: where we're spending taxpayers' money unnecessarily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8554.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's why we're working with the department heads to develop a policy that enables them to manage their time to their team effectively and implement the overtime procedures that meets the needs of our constituency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8566.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The police department has done a much better job curbing overtime and has lowered the police overtime budget from about $2 million in 2018<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8576.71s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to an average number of 1.2 million for the past four years, a reduction of over 35%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8582.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The fire chief and mayor's office, the human resources director, are working diligently on accountability as it relates to OT.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8589.0s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As one example, 28 letters have been issued to staff putting them on notice that their sick time use, which causes the need for overtime, seems excessive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8597.827s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Within the DPW, we hired DPW commissioners to help manage the department, specifically the OT budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8604.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The topic on the agenda is how overtime is managed in our building department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8608.844s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We cannot have a union member fielding calls and assigning overtime shifts to themselves and their fellow employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8615.786s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That presents a conflict that we made this change over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8619.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This did find to be necessary change, especially when almost $50,000 was paid out to overtime during the period my chief of staff was out on maternity leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8630.715s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Our current building commissioner fields the calls from dispatch as part of department responses hierarchy and works within the written protocol to determine the immediate life safety status situations in an effort to determine the need for an inspector on scene.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8646.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If the situation does not present an urgent need to respond, the commissioner will decline to send an inspector.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8652.999s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The address is tracked and scheduled for follow-up by an inspector the next day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8658.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In instances where our commissioner is unavailable, our former commissioner is contacted and makes a determination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8664.764s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The former commission has received less than a handful of calls over the last year and has paid $60 per call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8670.648s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The building department continues to develop protocol and the training to fine tune the best possible responses of the concerns and staff welcome construction feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8680.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mayor Kern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8681.594s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8682.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, what I've been hearing is nothing what was just read.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8688.632s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're seeing right now is practice that we've seen that I believe that our building department, by law, if you indulge me, Mr. President, by law, Mass Amendments Building Codes, Section 116.1 Unsafe Structures,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8712.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm hearing that we have concerns with protocol that's now been lifted because of said overtime, as the mayor has stated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8722.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're seeing right now, I don't believe is true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8726.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I'm seeing right now is that our building inspectors who historically have gone out and not used the overtime that's been stated for overuse or misuse,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8739.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but because it's standard and it's practice and it's making sure our constituents are safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8745.706s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When a structure is put in crisis, whether it's be fire or water or some kind of accident that maybe a car hits a home and it's after hours, our inspectors are called and they're the governing body that comes in to deem that facility safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8768.004s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're being told now is that we have a protocol in place where, because of financial reasons, we have, that's another question, we have the former director, the former commissioner of the building department still on staff being paid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8784.394s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It says that he's paid $60 when he's called, but I would like to know what he is paid by still being on the books.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8792.839s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because if we're hurting for money, there's a question there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8797.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What I've been told is that if the building department isn't called, then the fire department, the deputy on call, will make that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8809.324s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That is dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8811.427s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're not the governing body or the body that deems a structure safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8817.006s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that is a huge liability and huge safety issue and concern for our residents and our homeowners and our constituents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8826.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're seeing some very, very questionable practices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8832.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I find it very difficult that this mayor is putting this into place with other questionable reasons as we're moving forward, and I'll get to those later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8839.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But we have our fire department that is thin as it is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8845.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that if no building department is called for an overtime, which is minimal, by the way, to come in and clear that, there is a trickle down effect financially that harms our community even more than any overtime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8860.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're asking for our firefighters to come down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8863.555s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're asking for possible detail from the fire department to sit there possibly for four, eight hours in overtime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8870.099s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then you're possibly leaving our community in crisis<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8875.583s">[Scarpelli]</a>: by the ability not to have an engine back to where it should be, where it's needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8880.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Instead, it could be possibly at that site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8884.629s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that I don't understand why it's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8888.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that I find it very difficult to understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8892.254s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't an organization, a group of people that have worked very hard for this community for many, many years and done so much for us and really just do their job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8903.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're seeing some tactics by this mayor that it's very glaring against the working men and women of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8912.316s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It seems like it's very petty, and it seems like it's very vindictive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8919.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been told that our building department now has had practice on Wednesday nights, the late evening, that they would have a working dinner as a group<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8928.78s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with the commissioner for many years, this commissioner, the past commissioners, that they would come in and they would have dinner together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8937.107s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that practice has stopped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8938.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What reason?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8940.79s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8943.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But for the ability to have your commissioners there, when a constituent comes in and has the ability to talk to any one of the building inspectors that they're working with on site, that's a relief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8958.018s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now you're told that these people have to now maybe, they can leave, they can go out for the half hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8964.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now you have constituents that are accustomed to have someone there no matter what.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8968.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now that's gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8970.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8972.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Could it be that the evening before that this rule was put in place, that the union member was called into the commissioner's office to tell them<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8983.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that this practice will stop, that they can't have dinner in a common area together, that this practice stop the day after the mayor opened the door and informed these members that if they do not stop a lawsuit that we've been given and we've seen from the Teamsters, that she's gonna go public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9007.245s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This to me doesn't seem anything to do with overtime and our mayor taking care of this community financially, because that's a joke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9016.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're seeing over and over again is the working men and women in this community being treated unfairly and disrespected by this mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9025.599s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Whether it's the DPW being drug tested, whether it's our DPW members of firefighters being followed by private investigators,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9036.747s">[Scarpelli]</a>: or what we hear today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9039.548s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is a disgrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9040.708s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is why our community is a mess because our mayor is childish and our mayor is putting her feelings in front of what's right in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9052.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, excuse me, but this is enough is enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9055.251s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We need to stop this practice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9057.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's causing the city to lose thousands and thousands of valuable dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9063.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know we have building inspectors here this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9066.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have other members that are directly affected in this community that have expressed concerns, because there are some serious concerns here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9076.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because what I'm told, if no one else in the building department or the commissioners don't come out, and again, a commissioner that I don't understand why we're still paying, considering he's the assistant commissioner in Brockton.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9087.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why we have a sitting commissioner that's in his office today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9091.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why are we paying that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9092.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're so worried about financial issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9095.228s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why is it a problem?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9096.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But regardless, let's move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9099.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Let's say nobody comes out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9102.092s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Do you know who makes that call?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9103.994s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The deputy chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9106.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, I know we have one deputy chief here tonight that will tell you, I hope, that he shares that this is a huge liability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9113.76s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something they're not legally authorized to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9119.024s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you're gonna see a practice of what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9121.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Sorry, structure inhabitable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9125.449s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Shut it down overtime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9127.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not because what was said that we're giving people overtime because her rules, her ridiculous rules are forcing our members to waste our city's finances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9144.323s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, Mr. President, this has to stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9148.146s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This petty, vindictive, ego-driven negativity has to stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9154.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It has to stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9157.208s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The morale in this community from our workers are a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9163.509s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Go up and down, go through the hallways, talk to the rank and file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9167.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, all of you, all of us have been endorsed by unions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9171.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All of us have said that we support union labor workers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9175.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what we said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9177.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When is enough enough?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9178.559s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When do we all stand together and say this is enough?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9182.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because we've heard it over and over again from the Teamsters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9187.542s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've seen it over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9188.963s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've been in meetings that we've been informed that we're paying out thousands and thousands of dollars because she is being sued and the city's being sued and they're losing case after case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9201.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When are we gonna wake up and realize, hey, maybe we didn't need an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=9205.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Maybe we just need a leader that manages our finances correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10224.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10225.186s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that I have a bunch of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10227.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that starting with, I believe, Mr. Brinch, is he still on, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10248.887s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I have talked to the rank and file, and I've talked to many, many members of our union, and I've talked to these members, and the understanding that the fear that they have to speak because of retaliation is evident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10266.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The mayor has spoken over and over again how she has come to the City Hall to clean up City Hall as if this is the Wild West.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10276.563s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's said we've seen good people hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10280.147s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we can go all the way back because we were part of those meetings where we see how much money that have been settled on many, many occasions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10290.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we understand that we are losing money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10292.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's a reason why these union members that have the right to file grievances because they feel that they're being treated unfairly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10302.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when it goes through the process, the reason why we're losing so much money is because this administration has over and over again gone after our union workers without true facts,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10318.829s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and true understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10320.55s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is why we're losing thousands of dollars, both in legal fees for lawyers to represent the mayor and for settlements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10332.94s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we talk about this letter that was read by the assistant commissioner, the deputy commissioner, my question to him real quick, he started saying things that this was done, this action was taken,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10348.894s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with lining up our employees and going into a drug truck, testing truck, like a herd of animals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10359.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because they got calls from their wives, not them, how disgusted they were that they were treated that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10366.028s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's protocols in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10367.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There are laws in place when you talk about drug use in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10372.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, you hit the great buzzwords and how you're there to protect and make sure that our city's safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10378.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Or are we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10379.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It says in your own letter that it was put forth to the HR department and yourself months ahead of time that there was some concerns about drug use and drug issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10390.484s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What was done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10392.804s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then when it came to this syringe, when it came to this one syringe, you're talking about a public bathroom that's used by everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10402.327s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe the protocol that's in place by law and by statute<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10407.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and by union rules, is that the two administrators in that department have to identify employees that might be under the influence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10416.536s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then that gives them the course to go to get drug tested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10420.379s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not what we saw.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10422.84s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Instead, we saw, we heard and witnessed that our employees vindictively were taken out of the streets that were working,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10437.114s">[Scarpelli]</a>: lined up and given drug tests and alcohol tests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10441.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So these are interesting questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10442.976s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But more importantly, we have members that that are here tonight that aren't afraid to come here and shed the truth of why this resolution came up and why I had to share this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10455.439s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because the mayor talks about public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10458.54s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Public safety is in the changes you've just made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10463.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll have other questions too, why Mr. Foti is even still working for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10470.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if I can, I'd rather yield to the podium, Mr. President, because we have union members that can answer a lot of these questions, because what the mayor said isn't true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10482.47s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10483.151s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These members have told me over and over again, different members, some afraid to come to this podium, some are here right now that can answer those questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10490.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10511.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They said that months before they were identified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10738.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10739.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that one person that was identified then with past, was it similar and was that employee the same person?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10749.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because it would be interesting to see that that one person that was, it could have been carried over because what we hear is, what I've been told by the union members themselves, something they weren't afraid to tell me, that not one person<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10764.362s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that were drug tested that day tested positive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10767.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Everybody was negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10769.165s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's something they told me that I can openly disclose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10775.368s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not one person tested positive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10817.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So with that being said, I think it's important that we understand this policies and protocol, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10822.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That the DPW director and his deputy, if it's found that there's drug or alcohol use, they are trained to first observe those people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10834.193s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and then move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10836.794s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that day when we had 35 members in a line to get drug tested, in your professional opinion, did you identify them to be under the influence?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10867.859s">[Scarpelli]</a>: on this issue, and I don't wanna be the dead horse, but again, we have a bathroom that's used not just with employees, but as said by the commissioner, that is also open for contractors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10880.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We also realize that there are other avenues why people use syringes, whether it be diabetics, whether it be any other medical issues that were legitimate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10891.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's the reason why protocols are put in place that the leadership of that department,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10897.302s">[Scarpelli]</a>: are trained to identify any drug use or alcohol use and then have right and course to move forward and what I've heard and what I've seen it's not didn't happen didn't happen that way and instead we put ourselves out there for another lawsuit and the attorneys that I've talked to because I can't talk to attorneys because we don't have a city solicitor the attorneys that I've talked to and when when the the the the um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10926.75s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the legal document that I showed them to see where we're going to be later in life with this issue, we're in trouble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10935.717s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, that's just one issue, again, of the way we're treating our union members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10940.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate that, Mr. President, but I do know that the issue in hand that was brought forth in this resolution was really about the overtime and the fear of public safety with the building inspectors not being able to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10957.159s">[Scarpelli]</a>: do their job as the governing body that's by law that should be doing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=10963.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if I can, Mr. President, if my colleagues don't have any questions, I know that deputy chief has been waiting patiently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11193.43s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It would be interesting to see if there is a common trend with the person that has identified as having been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11208.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: caught with being tested positive and the prior incidents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11212.179s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That'll be interesting to know because if our HR department didn't do that due diligence when it was identified months ahead of time, I think that's a bigger problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11220.781s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11222.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, the issue at hand is about the overtime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11228.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the question that you bring forth over and over again is the overtime funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11233.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and not spending the money wisely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11236.893s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, you haven't answered the question, why the former commissioner?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11241.174s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I'm sure he's not doing it for $60.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11244.435s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sure he's still being paid just to be still on call for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11251.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because no one in all my years, that'll be interesting to know the truth, because it's just not $60 when he's called.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11286.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, so he's not getting a stipend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11289.33s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not getting a stipend for being on call or being part of the city workforce still?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11297.492s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, he's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11298.772s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, careful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11369.989s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's not something that's locked, I know for sure, because I went the other day, it's an open bathroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11378.434s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So there's a lot of questions here, but more importantly, back to the original issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11386.479s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're paying the assistant director commissioner of buildings from another community to come in and pay him even a dollar<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11399.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: while we have union employees that have done this over and over again for years, but haven't gotten a contract for over three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11410.621s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I find this very, very difficult to take when it's something so simple as you're projecting that this is just me trying to save the city money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11421.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I'd like to ask you the question,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11423.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The evening when you walked in and you saw your employees sitting around a working table where they were working while they were eating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11433.038s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they were told to please stop the lawsuit or else you'll go public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11437.561s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Was that made up too, Madam Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11438.821s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I need to know this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11667.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: In response, Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11670.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You make it sound so simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11674.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But if it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, it's a duck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11678.163s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have seen the way the firefighters have been treated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11682.424s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have seen the way the DPW members have been treated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11685.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now the building inspectors that have been treated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11688.527s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All of them with legitimate issues, because your administration<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11692.515s">[Scarpelli]</a>: has done a poor job in following the rules and the guidelines of the union contracts that was set forth as the law of this community and our employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11704.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So you can say you didn't know anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11706.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You could say that it's one person being vindictive, but there's a common denominator with all of these unions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11713.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a common denominator with all of these concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11716.526s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's a common denominator with all of this money being spent for attorneys and fees and settlements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11721.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's you, Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11723.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the quicker the city realizes it, the better the city will be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11728.063s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because you are dividing this community and you're pointing at the hottest working people that make this city run, not you, Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=11737.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So shame on you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12451.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is about truth and understanding public safety, Mr. President, so I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12465.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, so again, this is concerning because, again, if the protocol is the commissioner, and then the former commissioner, and then somebody doesn't, they don't both don't answer, then our deputy chiefs are told that's their purview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12480.057s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So moving forward to that if it is their purview, and we are concerned about finances, the understanding if we have a fire<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12488.112s">[Scarpelli]</a>: firefighter, a deputy chief that doesn't have the bandwidth to call a structure habitable and has to leave it inhabitable, then they have to then do what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12500.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They have to bring in someone, a firefighter for overtime, and then possibly leave an engine at that site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12507.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So from what I gather, I'd like to know the information, how many times so far that our building inspector didn't pick up the phone, and then our former building inspector, who by the way, doesn't live in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12521.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it'll be interesting to see what that path leads when Mr. Young comes back up, because that's going to be interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12528.815s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I like to know the financial impact, and I like to know how many times both people were called<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12534.739s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and nobody responded back to our deputies when they've reached out, because I think that's more concerning, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12541.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12594.85s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So the question is, haven't we had issues with the corporate commission, the private commission, the task commission, that we've had issues that no one did not make?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12604.472s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then who's left to make that decision?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12608.533s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And are you qualified?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12609.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12612.033s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that alone, for one time, is enough to stop this movement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12948.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would make a recommendation if we can as a form of a motion that we meet with the mayor and her administration to figure out the protocol.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12961.413s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So public safety is paramount in this situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12965.676s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But in the meantime, we reinstate the policy that the building inspectors that have been on call for years dealing with what their<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12976.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: charged to do by mass law, that we go back to that practice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12982.101s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That would be my recommendation, Mr. President, if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12984.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that an amendment to the resolution?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12986.926s">[Scarpelli]</a>: An amendment to the resolution, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12988.468s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13191.223s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would not yield my paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13193.345s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If my councilors want to vote no on that, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13195.906s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think right now, public safety is imminent right now, waiting for a report to later<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13202.409s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we might be regretting that, and I don't want that ever to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13204.952s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for putting that forth, but I would not take place of my amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13220.066s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We understand, but I think where I'm asking for a vote is that this council asked the mayor to please implement what has been done in past practice to assure public safety immediately until we hear what Councilor Collins just mentioned as a very viable second option or follow-up option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13239.055s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that would be my recommendation, but we'll leave it to the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13243.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13260.806s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With the presentation of the mayor and her staff to answer all these questions, that would be fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13266.189s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13267.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14034.138s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14039.3s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sorry, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14053.365s">[Scarpelli]</a>: of our community have been clear and precise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14057.306s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think we definitely have some issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14059.427s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe that Councilor Collins has put together a great format that we need to follow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14065.029s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But as a council, now that we've heard this from the professionals, that right now there is serious issues and people are watching this, that God forbid if anything happens and this council didn't follow through with the correct motion<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14081.795s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for liability and safety of our citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14085.557s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a slippery slope, my friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14087.798s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I implore you to please, let's collectively as a group, let the mayor figure this out, but in the meantime, put the qualified people in place to make these decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14102.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because from what we've heard, if there was a fire tonight, and we have the two authorities, both the commissioner and the former commissioner not answering,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14111.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't have a professional that's going to deem a home habitable or safe, which then would lead to something very dangerous and very serious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14121.797s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So please, Mr. President, I implore my colleagues that this is so important that what we've heard already, we're not professionals at this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14132.963s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We heard from the professionals how serious it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14137.206s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I implore you to please listen and then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14141.852s">[Scarpelli]</a>: vote to tell the mayor unanimously that we support, we bring them back to whole right now until we figure out the proper protocol.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14152.125s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14152.986s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't us against you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14155.068s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is common sense right in front of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14671.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, what I said was, when the commissioner and the former commissioner are not available, the fire department members are not qualified to say that a structure is safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14686.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what I said to correct what you said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14689.747s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the other piece that I want to follow up real quick with what was said is that I'd like to know, and part of this may be added on,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14701.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as a C paper, that I think people might be misunderstanding that this might be hundreds of thousands of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14709.149s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14710.73s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14711.711s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The overtime that our building inspectors are getting for overtime isn't a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14718.616s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So we're not talking about saving a teacher's job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14721.217s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You're talking about minimal money to make sure that public safety is paramount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14727.982s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14728.942s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14993.268s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand, I thought that was my thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14995.33s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's not, can you just hold it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15112.861s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah, I met with the building department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15116.243s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We had in depth conversation the two biggest things with size and illumination if it would affect any residents in the area, and the second would be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15125.129s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that if the sign, the special permit would be a hindrance for public safety in that corner area, and I was informed that both are fine, so I would move approval for the sign change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15293.051s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15293.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I apologize for the delay that we should have moved you forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15296.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So if I could take it back, I would, but we see everything is in order for the, the change of business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15304.036s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I believe it's the former porch is now the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15311.615s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the establishment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15312.735s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and I believe that everything is in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15315.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I did see that the times that you're requesting fall in the parameters that do not need a special vote yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15322.438s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If you extend those hours, we'd welcome a motion through the clerk's office to help in any way we can to make sure that we can help your business thrive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15333.601s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's the fear that the community heard was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15337.882s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that an establishment being left open and I'm so glad that that the establishment is now moving in and I see nothing to hold back Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15347.808s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would move approval after my colleagues have any questions or concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15482.338s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, we'll be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15616.741s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15617.902s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15618.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15618.523s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15619.417s">[Scarpelli]</a>: drop the, delay the papers 25-011, 25-012 till our next meeting, or if I have to dispose of it, I will bring it back up at a later date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2179.421s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2181.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, my question was from the beginning of the presentation, but Paul, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2186.666s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, you could see the hard work in the presentation, and there is a lot of excitement with some of these opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2195.712s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think that I'd be remiss to say that, you know, we're seeing some we're seeing the impacts of, um, the lack of communication again to really get the word out to the neighborhoods and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2209.681s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, I know that in the last few weeks we've done, we've tried to do the best we can and we're doing more than we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2216.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think we were seeing it now with so many questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2221.406s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as we're getting to the end of the Salem Street district and the neighborhoods rallying<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2228.728s">[Scarpelli]</a>: um, and really not feeling like they've been part of the part of the process or have been given the questions answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2237.756s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, and there's a lot of fear and a lot of questions going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2241.219s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, um, as tonight started, I received a few emails from, um, residents from Lawrence Estates, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2251.773s">[Scarpelli]</a>: letting me know that they just found out that there's some sort of a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2255.034s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Uh, and I think we I know that I've shown you the date from when the last council really focused on implementing a more robust process and communications and bringing these meetings to the neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2272.017s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know it's not it wasn't written in the R. F. P. I know Councilor President Bears informed us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2278.838s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2280.738s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we move forward, we really need to find a better way, even if it's a reverse 911, letting the neighborhoods know that these meetings are happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2292.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I know we've had up to almost 20 meetings now discussing this process, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2300.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I implore all of us to understand that there is groundswell starting in a negative undertone when it doesn't have to be for the fact that even the Salem Street situation, a lot of these, the questions that the fair, a lot of them could be answered in the meeting with the simple sentence or two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2320.824s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2322.833s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think again, uh, if we when we move forward, I see our schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2327.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The schedule looks great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2328.836s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're at the beginning phases of this process, this new process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2333.539s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, um, I just don't want to be in the same place we are with the Salem Street<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2337.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: uh quarter and what we're hearing now and the displeasure and the the anger and the discourse and this divide now and it's it's it's something that I think we need to find a way that this council this uh city administration needs to really we we have so many avenues a communications director we have um we have different avenues that we can tap into I mean it's we really need to find a way if we can to please<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2368.997s">[Scarpelli]</a>: set the schedule, alert people when we're going to be talking about their neighborhoods so they can be present or at least to be told that we've done A, B and C. I just don't think people have heard us and they truly don't know the impacts that are being created in their neighborhoods until it's time to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2394.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to the end product, which we're seeing Salem Street getting really close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2398.717s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And, um, and I'm sure everybody there is heard the negative undertone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2404.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I hate to be the Debbie Downer every time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2408.443s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, you come to come to us for for meeting because of all the hard work you've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2414.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I just had to share that with you as we move forward with this next process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2418.608s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2419.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Vice President, for allowing me to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2495.886s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=486.133s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know one of the key pieces I was asking for is the mayor's plan for capital plans and projects that are slated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=494.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that from what I hear and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=497.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: from the state, Metro wasn't on the list of 10 so far for the MSBA for the new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=508.426s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But it'd be interesting to see before we vote on such a large money order and understanding what the MSBA has already shared and what's coming down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=520.355s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that's not pressing, but again, I requested a report<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=525.704s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I haven't seen anything, if you can enlighten me, but I haven't seen anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=543.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We talked about adding this project, the scope of this project, in front of this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=551.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's important that we know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=554.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what's ahead of us and how we're planning on funding all of these projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=559.067s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's a little disheartening as well, Mr. President, I know that we talked last week and when I conferred with an attorney, it's nothing illegal to ask for a financial breakdown of the process with the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=575.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it's a little disingenuine when you come here in front of this council and it's a $5 million, but when you ask for a simple question,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=583.556s">[Scarpelli]</a>: for a breakdown of financial matters that happen in the school department and we hear nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=589.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So those are the two big things that I'm a little curious about before we move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=593.563s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I move on to thinking about influence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=594.944s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=1995.966s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=1997.487s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you so much for the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=1999.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is very thorough, and I think that this is something that's needed, no doubt about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2004.774s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, the so-called new schools, I was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2007.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: on what was called the 18 when we first started in elementary school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2012.881s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I must have slipped in by accident as a teacher back in the day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2016.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So it was definitely needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2019.003s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know I've talked to a lot of parents and teachers, former colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2024.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know it's very important, but for one Councilor, like I said, I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2029.026s">[Scarpelli]</a>: my apprehension is really and the structure of the way that our administration is informing us and where we are, at least this one Councilor, where we are financially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2037.853s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, if I, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2039.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Cushing, forgive me if I'm wrong, but this first five million, this is something that we'll be bonding as well, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2047.16s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2047.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2048.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then the bigger number is the one that comes later and obviously it's going to follow if we approve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2053.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's something I totally want to support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2056.587s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But unfortunately,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2058.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not getting the information back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2059.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not gonna halt it by rule 21 or section 22 of this project tonight, because I hear what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2066.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think there is a timeline, but I think to the president and to the mayor to understand as we move forward with these bigger projects, I think having more robust discussion of what our financial outlook is in the whole community and what's coming down the line, which I think is very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2084.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think it's something that I will be using.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2087.749s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I won't hold this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2089.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know how the timeline is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2091.311s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not going to hold it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2092.352s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can't support it because it's against what I feel is my position here as a city councilor, and that is being the steward of our finances and understanding what the big picture is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2104.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it could be something very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2105.828s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's just that I haven't had any communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2107.669s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've asked that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2108.209s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know you were here last meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2109.95s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's something I asked for from the administration that we, part of this meeting, we talk about what the implications are as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2116.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We look at different projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2118.354s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Like I know that the override was failed with the fire station, but there are still needs there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2125.458s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're also talking about what's happening for the new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2128.279s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's something that I wanna support a thousand percent, but we still don't know what the impact will be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2134.663s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If we try to, you know, reach out and try to either bond or ask for an override in or debt exclusion for that project so there are so many pieces you know we're also talking about so many new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2147.739s">[Scarpelli]</a>: zoning implications that are hitting us pretty soon and and wanted to see what what kind of growth the city will use these new zoning rules and how that can grow help us grow so there's so much involved and I think that uh again for one council who understands and wants to support this because of the need and I won't I won't hold it back but that's the reason why I can't I can't support it fundamentally I can't I have a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2175.271s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For some odd reason, the communication with this councilor and the city administration is zero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2180.932s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think something simple as asking for a breakdown of the superintendent's buyout, which is not fraudulent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2186.974s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not saying anything that was illegal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2188.414s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not saying it was wrong or bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2190.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what it's called in the terms when you settle on a mutual buyout and just asking for that financial implication so we can understand the process and getting answers back saying that it's a school committee purview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2204.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We know that's wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2205.378s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I spoke to my attorney that will speak to me that is very well versed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2211.36s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is, it's a basic request from a city councilor, especially when it's funding that's ultimately signed off by, for one of the votes by this councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2222.104s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I hope you understand why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2224.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But again, I appreciate the thorough breakdown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2228.025s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is obviously something you've<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2230.402s">[Scarpelli]</a>: done so so much work on and it's great to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2233.385s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm sure we have plans for moving all the summer programs because they know how important they are out of those two buildings and I know that's going to be daunting so but I also I love the fact that we're already planning for that so these are a lot of great you hear a lot of great things and I appreciate the hard work that you've done so and thank you for hearing me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2657.351s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1809.235s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, President Villes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1811.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Um, I know that, um, when you look at the financial impacts to resurface, um, um, place that I know that our high school team uses that, uh, those courts and if<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1828.984s">[Scarpelli]</a>: those courts are not playable like in my profession where we've lost our courts for our high school team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1836.291s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We then have to bus our high school teams off site to support their practices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1844.658s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that I know the high school uses it during the spring season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1849.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that Kevin does use it a lot with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1853.688s">[Scarpelli]</a>: with outside groups or with recreation groups that bring in funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1858.469s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think it's important that, especially as we're seeing pickleball grow, keeping tennis-only courts, especially when you're looking for a facility that is what placed it is, having, I believe, four courts, three or four courts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1877.547s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you know, the programming to be dedicated to tennis and it doesn't, it's not interrupted like what you see at over at Duggar Park, which is a huge benefit, but it also has to, has to be shared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1891.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that's a huge piece to take in consideration, the money that's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1899.848s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that's saved in the trickle down effect back to our budget when it comes down time to vote every little penny counts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1906.57s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know that that's a huge benefit for our high school athletic program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1912.111s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2049.891s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2051.152s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm so happy to see this on the agenda that we're going to entertain this because I think that safety is the biggest concern, especially what we're seeing for activities at the Shell, not just for shows or entertainment, but for our farmers market and the ability to light that area, I think is so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2073.65s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think when you look at that, the other piece that you see is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2078.453s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As a recreation employee, as soon as we went to to Moscow lighting, we realized the cost savings that directly came back to our city and our department because of the fact that with the old system of lighting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2098.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 1, it was archaic and to the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2103.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: understanding of someone sending somebody down to flick a switch and then come back later to flick the switch again would cost you four hours in overtime and that adds up believe it or not so musco lighting has been a godsend to municipalities so i think that it really saves<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2124.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: when you look at finances and a hidden cost that really pays off at the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2130.042s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I'm glad to see this and I would support it as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2133.707s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2466.585s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, I apologize, Mr. President, it's left up, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2677.568s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. President, I'm sorry, my hand was up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2679.31s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2682.305s">[Scarpelli]</a>: no i apologize i put it up and down so many times i just wanted to make sure that miss dupont just uh just share with the public i know that we've had some questions in the past and i had an email today just that people were questioning whether um how does this fit as if it's not a city facility this is something that i support as a historical building in our community and trying to enhance that and make sure we we provide assistance any way we can to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2711.21s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to make sure the Shallow Baptist and I believe the Unitarian Church as well that people understand that there are criteria that we follow that but legally we can use our CPA funds to assist in projects like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2731.4s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that the question that I had today was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2735.122s">[Scarpelli]</a>: they weren't against any of these uh the the churches personally but the question was if the tax money is uh is it going to a city owned facility that's what they were confused in so i know that i know if miss dupont can expand expand on that a little bit i know that there are some legalities that show that it absolutely fits into this um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2758.124s">[Scarpelli]</a>: this criteria and we're not violating any legal issues, but I just wanted to make sure we had clarification on that because I want to make sure that there's no negativity behind any of these projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2772.216s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think they're all worthwhile and in my mind fit the scope of historical and I would support it a thousand percent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2781.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But just for that fact,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2783.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: if we can share any information that would help clear some questions some residents that have asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2790.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2905.915s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2906.716s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that there really weren't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2907.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It wasn't about just the facility that it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2910.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was a church.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2911.141s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It was that focus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2912.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The question was that if it's not a city facility, but I appreciate that answer being that defining that a community exactly what the title title is about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2922.493s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you for clarifying that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2924.415s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I hope that residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2927.518s">[Scarpelli]</a>: feel that that's adequate because I think it sure fits the purpose that I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2935.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3726.442s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=697.204s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=699.595s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=700.596s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I first want to acknowledge the fact that as one councilor, I was, when I first started my journey as a city councilor, I was firmly behind the charter change charter review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=712.965s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as we started moving forward and we started seeing some of the changes and what it can impact, my biggest<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=719.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The piece that really turned me around to vote against the charter review at the time was really looking at ward representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=727.792s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think it's because of working in a community that has ward representation and really having some situations where you saw<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=739.04s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the input of ward representation being looked at in some cases as special interests from section of the city to section of the city, but not what's best for the whole community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=750.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I found myself being very stubborn and stuck on my beliefs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=755.644s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And what I think I needed to do was take a step back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=759.065s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know that reading all the information that Mr. McDonald's team has done with the charter review and talking to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=767.884s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Jovino and different members of the committee and then reaching out to different colleagues from neighboring communities that have ward representation and truly understanding the positive impacts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=780.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that I was so narrow-minded, my thinking at the time was so narrow-minded that I really need to expand and really look at the greater picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=789.47s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as I see this presentation, I realized that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=795.255s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, if I could turn the clock back and if I could have helped by moving this forward back a few years ago when the commitment for the council was needed, I think I would do that today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=808.685s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But what I see in place is so impressive in the fact that we have people that were committed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=816.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that reached out to probably one of the greatest support teams with the Collins Center and someone who I respect in the world of municipalities, former alderman in Melrose and former city solicitor Frank Wright and listening and answering, listening to how he's answering the questions and his team and I think that this is a great<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=838.65s">[Scarpelli]</a>: great situation right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=840.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I love what we have, what we've crafted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=843.134s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have some reservations as well, but I know my colleagues have shared some, and I think that the biggest takeaway from this is I'm a huge advocate now for 11 councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=856.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm a huge advocate for ward representation for all eight wards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=862.009s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You realize as I talk to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=864.503s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as I talk to people, even in the city of Medford, and we talk about getting people involved in the election process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=870.727s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as I sit with marginalized people and they say, George, you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=873.729s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's easy for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=875.13s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You have a base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=876.571s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when you run at large, it's easy for you to raise $20,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=879.973s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's easy for you to say you represent everybody, because I think I've done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=884.636s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wouldn't ever take away that I represented everybody in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=889.079s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And if I ever ran, if it was the time that I ran, I probably would run at large just for the fact that I enjoy<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=894.428s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the whole community, that whole battle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=897.15s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But talking to my fellow colleagues in neighboring communities, you understand how important it is for mostly marginalized people that have been underrepresented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=906.955s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And right now there's a battle going on in another room talking about zoning reform at Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=913.198s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as a person who grew up off of Salem Street, my former neighbors have called me and said, George, why wouldn't you want ward representation with every ward considering<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=924.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Shame on you, because we didn't hear from you at Salem Street when it came to the ward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=928.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We felt like we weren't listened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=930.9s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is why now it's a battle with the Salem Street zoning situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=935.282s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And we're seeing that in pockets all over the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=938.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're seeing at Tufts University with the 10-story building, how it's affecting that community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=942.625s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I've talked to friends and neighbors there at St.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=944.326s">[Scarpelli]</a>: George.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=944.606s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Here we go again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=945.747s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The charter review is important because if we had a representative that we can go into in our own backyard that we see every day at the coffee shop,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=953.785s">[Scarpelli]</a>: then it wouldn't, the information wouldn't have been getting out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=956.767s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one of the biggest things I've had, the negative pieces I've had is a lack of information that's going out to the community because the lack of a written newspaper, the lack of true communication across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=968.293s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one piece that I found that made me feel secure in my process as I go forward with this is the thought process saying, you know what, we might not have a newspaper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=979.277s">[Scarpelli]</a>: but everybody in every small pocket of our community now will have someone that they feel like they can call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=985.262s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And so there are so many things I've learned, and like, again, I'm a big boy now, and I've learned a lot, good and bad, and I wish I could turn back the clock on some of the decisions I made, but when I see the information that's in front of us,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1003.417s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm really excited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1004.539s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm really excited and I commend all of you for all the hard work that you've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1008.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, if you've ever felt that I was an enemy to the cause,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1018.956s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't think I was educated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1020.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't educate myself to the cost because I was stubborn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1022.597s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So what I see in front of me right now, I can't wait to get this through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1027.478s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can't wait to get this to the legislature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1029.178s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I can't wait to come back so we can get this on the ballot and see all these great changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1034.639s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think we see a lot of things that aren't working in Medford and the divide in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1040.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: A lot of it's because we haven't done this, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1046.482s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you're seeing how important word representation is across the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1050.624s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's time to, like I said to, my wife and I were talking, I said, Jesus, Dina, she says, it's time for me to grow up and put my big boy pants on and say, hey, listen, this is a great proposal and let's do everything we can to move it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1064.909s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I commend your charter review team and our friends from the Collins Center, they've done so much work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1074.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: are the actual experts in this field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1078.834s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think guided this platform to a very robust discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1084.199s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, so I could talk a buzzard off a meat wagon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1088.162s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I just thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1089.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1494.464s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1494.824s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Council Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1495.605s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that as I went through my notes, I did have a note.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1500.506s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And correct me if we'll go back to this again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1502.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was a little preoccupied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1506.39s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As we started looking into composition of terms of office and eligibility, I wanted to ask the Collins Center, I think that one of the constituents, people that have read this and called and asked opinions, with the mayor's four-year term, and the council too, and school committee too, the question they brought up, I said, well, let me ask if it's common,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1534.457s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you see that two years really sometimes prohibits true government because you see that it's so short that you're finding that you're always politicking instead of doing what's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1546.341s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the question is, has that been entertained?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1548.662s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have you seen other communities do a three-year term where it's a two-year for school committee, three-year term for the council, and then four-year term for the mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1558.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's just something that was asked of me, and I just wanted to get your opinion on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1609.07s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's great input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1611.61s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1613.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I see what they mean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1614.67s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I understand what the two-year term is difficult, because it seems like you really, once you get going,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1623.857s">[Scarpelli]</a>: as an elected official, then all of a sudden you have people that you've promised so much to and they've come to you and said, now it feels like you truly are looking at times at the greater picture of an elected official.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1637.167s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's what's the greater good of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1638.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I appreciate the input and that's something I'll share with them if they're not watching tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1642.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2557.592s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2559.972s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2561.013s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Before I move on, if anybody wants any information about my glasses, it's a new, very expensive company that I can share with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2573.215s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's called Broke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2575.095s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's called Half Glass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2576.175s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's called Broke Cheats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2578.916s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I apologize for that, because I know my wife's watching right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2582.237s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And when I come home tonight, she's going to smash me with one of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2585.362s">[Scarpelli]</a>: the 15 pairs I have at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2586.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But the question I had was, I know that as we talked about this, I had a question that a resident asked, and I know it's by ordinance, but when we have boards and commissions, have you ever seen a charter, a part of the charter be put in more, anything that would recommend the concerns of residency requirements for different boards and commissions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2611.47s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that something that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2613.154s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we would put in our charter or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2617.236s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2617.416s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I, if I could, that'd be something that I don't see it in front of me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2622.119s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that where we can fit that, I think that that's been a concern where we've had commissions or boards of commissions in the city that residents might've been living here and we can understand if they moved out that they finished the term, but we're seeing a lot of people that, that we see people that have been on boards of commissions that don't even live in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2643.577s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think that, you know, finding that language and seeing if that's something we should visit, if that, we could see anything pertaining to that would be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2653.623s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2664.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, just make a motion to request friends from the Collins Senate to see if they can draft any,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2673.867s">[Scarpelli]</a>: information that might be prudent for us to look at and maybe vote on for the possibility of resident requirements for boards and commissions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3087.692s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you and appreciate constantly has bringing us forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3089.733s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that, um and the spirit of what I've seen with this administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3094.897s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think having that majority vote in my opinion is isn't robust enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3100.08s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3108.88s">[Scarpelli]</a>: some authority and more openness and transparency when it comes to positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3114.044s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I know that one of the biggest things we've seen over the last couple of years is that the positions that are created that this council doesn't even vote for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3122.931s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's happened multiple times, not just with this council, but previous councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3130.357s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think lessening that and giving the mayor's office more of autonomy to make these decisions<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3138.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: without a more weighted process that really makes it accountable for the position that she's presenting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3155.589s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think I would rather see the two-thirds vote for the fact that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3162.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That meat is needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3209.771s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just wanted to note that we... I'm reading the red line as I'm reading the original, so... Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3214.652s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3216.113s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I withdraw.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3216.693s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3738.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: If I can, I think that with the professionals from the Collins Center, 40% sounds like a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3747.257s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What would you recommend?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3749.398s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What have you seen that really works and where that middle ground where the, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3756.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: extra one-on-one elections that might cost the city money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3784.748s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3788.349s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3788.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's my fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3791.371s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're seeing what's coming out in local elections recently in Medford, you know, with 60,000 residents and 40,000, 35,000, 40,000 voters and only 13,000, 14,000, 15,000 coming out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3798.333s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that would pose a problem for the process, you know, going any higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5509.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5511.791s">[Scarpelli]</a>: As I, like I said, I really focused on really looking into this process because it was one of the pieces that really limited me from moving forward with the chattel review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5525.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And now as we're seeing the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5530.777s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The body that has worked on this, the professionals that have worked on this, and the committee that's gone out to the city and the community and worked diligently with the community have drafted a proposal that I think is what the community is asking for, the residents are asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5547.567s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think I mentioned the key pieces that I think understanding the representation for all of our wards is so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5557.116s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think when we talked about the ability for someone that's marginalized that might not have the opportunity to run at large.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5571.294s">[Scarpelli]</a>: having a better chance running an award, even running in the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5574.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So having a better representation, maybe seeing a council that looks a little different than we see today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5580.081s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's what I've heard from council, from community members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5583.784s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that when we look at this and I looked across the state, I believe there's only three out of the whole state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5590.81s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I believe there's only three, correct me if I'm wrong, but there's only three that have a seven body council when you look at this format.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5599.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think what you see is a council of ward representation and at-large members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5605.321s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that's a huge involvement and openness and form of transparency, communication, and reachability to every corner of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5621.922s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think what the Charter Review Committee has put forth with the 11 members, I think it's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5629.307s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I think that that's something that I think the, tell me if I'm wrong, but the majority of the community has said to me, and this is why I know so much about it, because I was against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5639.935s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I was against ward representation completely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5641.996s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So now when you sit and talk and the understanding of every single ward, imagine telling one ward they're not represented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5647.841s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Okay, but no, no, the district, but it's not the ward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5651.97s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is what we're seeing right now because we're the divide in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5655.953s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We do have a huge divide in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5657.854s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And one of those divides is people feeling that they don't, they're not listened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5662.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They're not, they don't have anybody that they feel they can go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5666.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And especially when you see the demographic method now, we have a lot of new method residents coming in that have grown up in communities that have ward representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5673.745s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that comfort level is gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5674.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they've eliminated themselves of being part of that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5678.397s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I think we're seeing so many pieces that this fits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5685.678s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And changing what is put forth I think would be a frightening thought because here's the piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5693.38s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We saw with the override question that this community was divided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5699.461s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we're seeing right now, what I'm hearing from both sides saying that this is something they like, it fits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5706.102s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's something that you meet, you can really go and I think this would be something that they could support and move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5711.246s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I will tell you the comments that I've heard from residents saying if we go to seven, doesn't that sound like and against conspiracy theory but unfortunately this community runs on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5722.12s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Doesn't this sound like it's just an organization wanting to keep the numbers down so they can control this council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5728.103s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm not saying that it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5729.925s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm saying that this is the perception that goes out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5733.347s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is where, when it comes down to a vote of charter change, charter review, and a vote, this is where we won't get the support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5740.491s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, again, I say this publicly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5743.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't believe in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5744.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But these are the questions that have been brought up that said, when we go to the vote,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5748.991s">[Scarpelli]</a>: let's give the city what they've been asking for, what the professionals have brought forward, what the committee that has worked so hard to go to every corner of the city and draft this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5761.497s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that that's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5764.898s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we look at the different compensation piece, I know we've held that off and we're gonna revisit that again, but I've listened to some community members that had said, you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5777.143s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're in fiscal crisis, we're having financial difficulties in Medford, even with 11 people, how would you correct it and say, well, you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5783.525s">[Scarpelli]</a>: By moving toward representation, your schedule isn't as busy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5789.126s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not reaching out to every corner of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5792.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So maybe the compensation could be lowered because it would be less work in theory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5798.549s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I mean, there's so many pieces that you look at this and say, well, this is, it fits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5804.675s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because ultimately what we want is we want this community to vote for it and support it and move forward to change what we need in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5811.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is just a piece that I think is very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5814.301s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You know, we've said it a thousand times, and every member here, I've heard it and I've seen it on the campaign trail, that really having a representation of a more diverse council, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5828.309s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What could support a more diverse council but getting people that are marginalized, giving them the opportunity<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5834.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to really control the opportunity to win a seat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5841.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Not a bigger district, not a bigger community at large, but looking at a ward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5846.512s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's achievable for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5849.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know I joked with Councilor Beaz earlier, but we're hearing it, you know, you wouldn't really have in our revolutions text Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5861.263s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I did get an email that they asked if I can read it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5863.826s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is something that our revolution members put forth that many people voted for them because of this and that's what was said was our revolution metric advocates for transitions methods current at large electoral system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5879.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: to award-based representation model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5881.375s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This change aims to ensure that each neighborhood has direct representation and the city government promoting equitable participation and addressing the unique needs of diverse communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5891.937s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And their 2023-24 method people platform, ORM, our revolution method, emphasizes the importance of the city charter reform to implement ward representation, therefore enhancing the inclusivity,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5908.552s">[Scarpelli]</a>: inclusivity and responsiveness of local governance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5912.395s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I remind my colleagues that this is what you ran on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5915.117s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is your platform that you ran on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5917.699s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And to come in today, this is what leaves the city divided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5922.242s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what then comes in and says, you know what, then I know this committee did great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5926.726s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We want to see some change, but you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5929.311s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It seems disingenuous, to be honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5931.513s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So they sit back and say, what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5932.753s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm not gonna vote for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5933.934s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm gonna tell my families that are saying, well, instead of voting for the change of charter, why jeopardize this with something that works?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5941.099s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And maybe the call in Senate can prove me wrong, but there's a reason why we do 11, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5947.023s">[Scarpelli]</a>: There's eight members, every ward is represented, and then the three at large.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5952.807s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And correct me if I'm wrong, the majority, if not,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5957.988s">[Scarpelli]</a>: most of the state that has the ward representation has this form, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5966.83s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, like I said, I thought there's only three that have such a limited district process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5974.732s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So, and again, I urge my colleagues to follow the advice of the professionals, follow the advice of the people that have been in the streets in Medford, not nationally,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5986.611s">[Scarpelli]</a>: not different parts of the country, but in Medford, what they've done for their work to reach every corner of Medford that came out and said, let's do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5996.922s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that I feel strongly about, and I think that we should support this and leave it as it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6001.627s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So thank you, Mr. President, I mean, Mr. Chairperson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7051.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7334.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7335.877s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, I look at this presentation as something very important for the goal of this initiative being strong enough that the voters will pass and support what we bring forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7354.433s">[Scarpelli]</a>: What we've done is we've had the opportunity for a group of people to go out and get the information from the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7362.505s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Then we brought in the professionals from the Collins Center to support and guide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7369.509s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is what's come out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7372.53s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've heard some of my colleagues look at this, and I've got to be very honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7377.252s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We say it's not political, but I hear a lot of double talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7381.495s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm actually sitting back shocked that I'm saying, I can't believe that I'm saying what I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7386.977s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'm hearing this from the people on your own platform<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7390.908s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that you've said, quote unquote, like directly, that the importance of a city charter reform is implementing award representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7404.035s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm just confused because it seems like a lot of you are backpedaling for the platform that you were elected to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7410.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And at the same time, when it fit that dialogue, you've also said, well, these are the people that I knocked on their doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7418.56s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And those people, I have to support them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7421.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I have to push that agenda through, even though sometimes it's not best for the whole community, but these are the people that helped you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7427.392s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You've said it and elected you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7429.014s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now, maybe you could say it's not true, but I'll say it over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7432.679s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The power of video is amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7437.396s">[Scarpelli]</a>: These are things you've said and done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7438.697s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't pull this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7439.418s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I had a member of the revolution send this to me who didn't want to jeopardize their name or their friendship with some of you that said that they're very difficult to see this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7450.566s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I have some counsel saying that the difficult about this is really running the meeting and being organized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7458.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, that's not the charter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7460.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's our city council rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7463.098s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's our policies we can change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7464.618s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'll tell you one, and I can go to the meeting video as well, that when the council voted five to two to eliminate meetings every Tuesday night, and Councilor Caraviello and myself voted against it, the councilor that's here tonight mentioned that if we see it's not working, then we'll go back to the every Tuesday meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7483.481s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because I hear that as a problem, because the meetings are running longer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7487.334s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it seems like the message is being muddied, or it's taking too long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7493.499s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, that's a city council rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7495.661s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's not a charter rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7498.403s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've heard a councilor tonight talk about, well, imagine this, some of the wards are too small, so they don't need representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7507.551s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Wow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7509.132s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, a fellow councilor said that there are some of the wards, we could play it back, but some of the wards are so small,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7516.998s">[Scarpelli]</a>: that we maybe might not need ward representation in such small wards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7521.86s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I wrote it by word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7524.441s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then you hear, we're looking from the improvement, it's better than what we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7531.083s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm hearing council say it's better what we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7533.184s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Is that what we're here to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7534.645s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Just to get better or fix what's been wrong here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7539.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And again, this is coming from a place where I was against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7544.356s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now I feel like I'm standing on an island saying, am I hearing myself?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7550.359s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We've been praising Mrs. McDonald and her group and how hard they've been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7554.821s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And they've gone, they went out and talked to Medford residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7558.223s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They want to see Medford results.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7560.564s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They want to see this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7562.405s">[Scarpelli]</a>: The professionals at Collins Center said, this is what works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7565.787s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then we have Councilors bringing up numbers from Wyoming and California showing us numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7573.233s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Who cares?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7574.593s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We don't know their breakdown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7577.614s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm worried about Medford, Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7579.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And from what I gather, there are only three communities in the state of Massachusetts with this form of government that only look at district representation or such a small representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7592.259s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And then the biggest piece that we've said over and over again, and it sounds like because it doesn't fit the narrative, we're avoiding it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7600.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This will give us a more diverse community council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7604.802s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Of course it will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7606.943s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, we have a slow turnout.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7608.863s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, imagine if we have an award representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7613.224s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have we seen, maybe the Collins Center can help us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7616.205s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When you see organizations go from at large to award representations, I'm assuming that voter turnout will be larger because now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7627.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: you have people that are identifying certain groups and certain people that will then run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7632.181s">[Scarpelli]</a>: With the ward representation being that you don't have to encompass yourself throughout the whole community, time-wise, or raise enough money to run at large, we're giving our, or even a district, we're giving our residents an opportunity to be part of this great option and be a voice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7650.913s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know it sounds critical and maybe I'm attacking, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7655.222s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't anything that my fellow councils haven't said in meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7660.046s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And here I am coming back and saying, am I in a bizarro world?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7665.751s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I'll say this again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7667.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We're trying to pass a piece of legislation here that will go out that the city is gonna vote on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7677.901s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that's popular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7680.043s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is something that everybody I talked to on both sides, it didn't matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7686.049s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They appreciate the ward representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7687.809s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They appreciate that all eight wards will be represented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7692.47s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's something they can go to the election booth in November and vote in support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7700.992s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Why would we now finally get to the finish line and try to honestly look like you're trying to control it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7708.654s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Because that's what it sounds like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7709.674s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Look, this is what it sounds like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7711.214s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It sounds like you want seven people so you can control it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7714.602s">[Scarpelli]</a>: because when you open it to 11 people, maybe you don't, you lose the majority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7721.226s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So that's the disrespect that happens time and time with this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7725.369s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Listen, there are things that I don't, I don't like my fellow council say, but I would never disrespect and openly laugh like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7732.053s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7733.194s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is what we have at this council day after evening after evening when, when my fellow council is the chair of this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7739.698s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7740.896s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't anything that I made up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7743.476s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just explained what my fellow Councilors just said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7748.337s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just reiterated what my fellow Councilors have said in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7751.778s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just read a passage from the people's platform of our revolution that this council all ran on a slate, that they preached and ran on ward representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7761.72s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I didn't make this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7764.68s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know you're angry because it doesn't fit what you just presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7771.09s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and it might not go your way, but let's look at the big picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7776.393s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We want this passed now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7779.575s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And as one council that understands, and you look at the full picture now and do your homework and understand it and really not be angry at what I've lived through and say, have an open mind and look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7793.384s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I've had that open mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7794.404s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's allowed me to talk to a lot of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7797.927s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the eight wards being represented with the three out loud members is something that I would support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7805.633s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's something that the professionals from the call center support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7809.275s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And it's what the people that have gone meeting after meeting throughout the whole community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7815.46s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I know because they've called me a thousand times getting input from neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7824.448s">[Scarpelli]</a>: When we talk about let the people speak, I think the people, it was clear, it's right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7830.192s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Now this is being put forth by a Councilor for truly, I'll be honest with you, I don't see the weight in your presentation of why seven or district representation has been more beneficial than a true ward representation of all of our whole community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8905.185s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Mr. Chair, to my colleague that referenced the Council that got up and walked out while she was speaking, I want to apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8913.187s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I've been sick, so I ran out of water and I felt a little faint, so I had to go get water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8920.27s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I apologize if I disrespected any member of the council to get water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8924.871s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I apologize for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8927.412s">[Scarpelli]</a>: For my colleagues that seem to be offended that I'm bringing politics into politics, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8935.514s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But I don't align with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8939.755s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You are a slate of six that vote in tow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8943.456s">[Scarpelli]</a>: You usually vote in tow, but you all vote together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8946.975s">[Scarpelli]</a>: on your agendas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8948.276s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And that's known.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8949.137s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's nothing that's a secret.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8950.918s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm trying to attack anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8953.02s">[Scarpelli]</a>: But my position as a city councilor is to be the voice that people call or express a concern or the way they feel or they want to be represented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8964.689s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when I bring a topic forward, if it hurts your feelings, I'll do respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8969.332s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I don't care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8971.794s">[Scarpelli]</a>: My goal is to make sure that everybody's view is represented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8978.14s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So I know my council colleagues are upset or feel hurt or the reason that I disrespected them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8987.446s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I'm just sharing what has been brought to my attention by constituents that I'm expressing it night after night, because it seems like I'm the only one because some people just aren't listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9000.315s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And this is why our community is in flux right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9003.978s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So when we look at this situation right now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9006.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: where we are right now, the council brought up some changes and supported it, some with facts, some with his own beliefs, his belief system, which I respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9020.233s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's his belief system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9022.574s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's his due diligence looking forward in his decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9025.816s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Myself, I looked at it totally opposite, but I will not, I will not apologize to share<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9036.96s">[Scarpelli]</a>: what has been asked of me by constituents, maybe constituents that don't even vote for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9044.825s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So my personal opinion and my motion is we stay with the original presentation by the Charter Review Committee with the 11 representatives, eight board, three at large, and again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9064.588s">[Scarpelli]</a>: we can look back at this tape and listen to what everybody has said and what I expressed from what they said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9071.93s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't made up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9074.831s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't a dialogue to make this like some kind of a clown show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9080.012s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is an expression of one council's view in comparison to six others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9087.074s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I will not apologize for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9090.756s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And unfortunately, my friends,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9093.452s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is politics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9095.794s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This isn't, hey, kumbaya, let's all sit together and say, let's all do this, let's run together and let's have one vision and make Medford what we believe in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9104.1s">[Scarpelli]</a>: No, because that's not how it works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9105.681s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's a very different complex world we live in in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9110.225s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And the thing that people come back for over and over again is they feel that this council isn't listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9118.651s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And all I'm saying is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9120.758s">[Scarpelli]</a>: We have a committee that's worked their tails off months after months, night after night, getting the information that presented to the professionals and that presented to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9133.949s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And all I'm saying is the belief of a council making a change and my beliefs from what I've heard from constituents or my personal belief and understanding is that the ward representation of all eight wards are represented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9153.297s">[Scarpelli]</a>: and to throw in pieces like, well, you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9156.358s">[Scarpelli]</a>: They'll be there forever, or not enough people will come out in that ward, 2,500 people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9164.502s">[Scarpelli]</a>: That's the way of the world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9165.963s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This is how we work through things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9168.344s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To say that we won't have enough people, not enough people come out and vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9171.445s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Well, maybe these are the changes that will bring our constituents out to vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9174.866s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Make them feel like they're part of the solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9177.247s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Have them feel vested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9179.168s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Make them feel part of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9185.17s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, thank you for allowing me to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=15408.508s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Again, I urge this council to listen to the comments from the Collins Center that delaying this because Councilor Callahan and Councilor Leming haven't been heard, I think they've been heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=15421.694s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I mean, they were here, they were part of the discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=15425.573s">[Scarpelli]</a>: It's not like they haven't been here, they weren't here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=15428.856s">[Scarpelli]</a>: To now move this to another meeting and then to a meeting to vote, let's make a decision, let's move forward so we're not stalling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=15440.284s">[Scarpelli]</a>: This has to go to a vote, to the legislation, this has to go to the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=15444.667s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I just think that we keep kicking this can down the road and we're gonna be exactly where we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=15449.411s">[Scarpelli]</a>: So again, I think we entrusted<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=15456.002s">[Scarpelli]</a>: a group of citizens to do the work for this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=15461.467s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I think that it's been loud and clear what they've shared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=15467.572s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And I would be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=15469.907s">[Scarpelli]</a>: I would disagree with what motions of forward and put forth my motion to move forward with this vote with the ward representation of eight and then the three at large.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=15482.49s">[Scarpelli]</a>: And let's get this process moving so we can move method forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=15485.37s">[Scarpelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>
