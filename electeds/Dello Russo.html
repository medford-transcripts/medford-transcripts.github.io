    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=77.672s">[Dello Russo]</a>: I agree with that 100%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=82.341s">[Dello Russo]</a>: uh, chiming in here is because Medford street was mentioned, uh, which seems to be more of a gravel path these days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=90.924s">[Dello Russo]</a>: And I'm wondering if, uh, if the council wouldn't mind me amending this to include that the DPW commissioner, uh, uh, examine ways that we can perhaps resurface Medford street on the motion of council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=158.281s">[Dello Russo]</a>: It's completely germane to the Green Line project and would greatly enhance quality of life visitors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=165.767s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Even if you look at the quality of some of the sidewalks in that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=172.121s">[Dello Russo]</a>: I don't like to be critical, but I mean, a lot of them are just lacking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=176.503s">[Dello Russo]</a>: And it needs to be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=178.865s">[Dello Russo]</a>: We also, I'm sure we all received the same email this weekend that I know a group of neighbors up there had done really tremendous work in addressing some sanitation and rodent issues up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=194.573s">[Dello Russo]</a>: And we've seen additional infractions happening on the other side of the border.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=201.681s">[Dello Russo]</a>: you know, this is an area that a neighborhood that needs attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=206.905s">[Dello Russo]</a>: And I know a lot of the side streets up there have gotten some over the past couple of years as far as resurfacing, resurfacing, new pipes, sidewalks, and I'd love to see that continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=318.946s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=319.767s">[Dello Russo]</a>: So there's some time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=323.431s">[Dello Russo]</a>: I didn't mean to interrupt either one of you, but, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=326.502s">[Dello Russo]</a>: I do have to point out that even though, and I agree the crosswalks are faded and in need of attention, but you know, throughout the summer season, the staff at the Tufts pool does a wonderful job at putting up barriers and cones and really bringing attention and focus on the pedestrian traffic in that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=348.554s">[Dello Russo]</a>: So this can only help their efforts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1124.229s">[Dello Russo]</a>: I just want to commend Councilor Caraviello in suggesting that a committee be appointed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1129.473s">[Dello Russo]</a>: That's a wonderful thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1130.213s">[Dello Russo]</a>: You know, I spoke tonight up at the pool when we were examining that and the need to encourage opportunities when the pool is restored for people to participate in that as far as exercising leadership in the maintenance and operation of the pool facility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1149.056s">[Dello Russo]</a>: And again, because those oftentimes bring out the best in people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1154.463s">[Dello Russo]</a>: And having enthusiasts for dogs and pets to participate in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1162.142s">[Dello Russo]</a>: uh, establishing this, uh, new facility in the city, uh, for, for the dogs and, and for them to have their exercise and ability to, uh, uh, perhaps live, uh, in a more unrestrained way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1175.046s">[Dello Russo]</a>: I think it's wonderful opportunity for people to be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1177.527s">[Dello Russo]</a>: So I thank you, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1179.608s">[Dello Russo]</a>: And, uh, I lend my support to this, uh, uh, motion, Mr. President on the motion as amended when a roll call vote on the roll, Mr. Clark.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1750.091s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Just a point of information, Mr. President, and maybe Councilor Penta could refresh my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1756.735s">[Dello Russo]</a>: When was the Judge Jackson report issued?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1767.26s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Penta, through the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3501.579s">[Dello Russo]</a>: That's a thing of the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3502.78s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. President, point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3504.161s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3505.602s">[Dello Russo]</a>: still the contracted auditor for the City of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3511.725s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4580.531s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Vice president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4581.792s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you, uh, Mr. President and council along the current, uh, uh, presents a, uh, a very worthwhile resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4589.518s">[Dello Russo]</a>: We, uh, maybe,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4592.281s">[Dello Russo]</a>: I don't know if it was Mrs. Burke or in Baker, our auditor, prepared annually for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4602.567s">[Dello Russo]</a>: I think maybe Stephanie always used to ask for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4606.43s">[Dello Russo]</a>: It was a sheet that showed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4609.258s">[Dello Russo]</a>: all the bond indebtedness that we had, but it rolled out 30 years, and it showed us when something was going to end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4617.972s">[Dello Russo]</a>: It was a very helpful tool for us to examine everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4624.594s">[Dello Russo]</a>: It had big items on there that we're still paying off, some of the schools and all that type of stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4629.839s">[Dello Russo]</a>: And then some smaller, bigger items, like every time we have to drop several hundred thousand dollars on a new fire truck, things that we'd bond maybe for a shorter term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4640.51s">[Dello Russo]</a>: So, I think it would be very helpful in us looking at that, and I agree with Councilor Penter in the sense that we need to be updated on where we are with the city yard, what's going on with that, and most especially with the police station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4657.916s">[Dello Russo]</a>: The last meeting we had on that several months ago, it was still called out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4663.839s">[Dello Russo]</a>: And we're waiting for an update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4666.567s">[Dello Russo]</a>: And I know sometimes getting engineer studies and soil samples and all that kind of stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4671.497s">[Dello Russo]</a>: It takes time to compile and pull together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4674.578s">[Dello Russo]</a>: But, you know, the scenario, tentative scenario that was laid out for us for the police station wasn't something that was pleasing to me, I must say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4684.621s">[Dello Russo]</a>: And I'd really like to see where we are with that before we get too far in something that maybe more than one of us will find disagreeable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4698.024s">[Dello Russo]</a>: I think Councilor Lungo-Koehn is right in asking for this update as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4706.188s">[Dello Russo]</a>: We do have aspects of the pool that are time sensitive, and I know access issues are very important to an awful lot of us, but that doesn't mean we can't proceed while examining, straightening that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4724.304s">[Dello Russo]</a>: So I'm grateful for all of that, and I hope that we can make progress on this, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5264.578s">[Dello Russo]</a>: If I could, through the chair, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5267.239s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Rosen,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5270.894s">[Dello Russo]</a>: So you pointed out a way of presenting budget and analyzing how each department finishes out each year, how it spent its money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5285.542s">[Dello Russo]</a>: And oftentimes when we get to the end of the year, we do so without doing so in that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5295.424s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Department X has $30,000 left over that it didn't spend, and it's the last week in June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5302.827s">[Dello Russo]</a>: So we're going to take that money and throw it into Department Y, who overspent $60,000, and hope let's try to find the other 30 somewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5316.792s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Vis-a-vis the whole capital improvement program, which I think is built into our budget as far as our indebtedness,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5325.01s">[Dello Russo]</a>: throughout the S.Y.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5325.75s">[Dello Russo]</a>: debt service each year is budgeted, because we know that's going to be what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5332.912s">[Dello Russo]</a>: How do you think we can then better improve the budget process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5464.031s">[Dello Russo]</a>: So starting out with the budget, because I sit on a board for the non-profit, and when we go through our annual budget, we do a projection that we know we're going to have this to work with, X. And then we build to that goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5480.843s">[Dello Russo]</a>: And part of that goal in the non-profit is an aspect of fundraising for operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5485.426s">[Dello Russo]</a>: But nonetheless, we meet that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5489.614s">[Dello Russo]</a>: And I think I've often thought that that might be a more helpful way of doing what we do here, though it's tough because there's so much unknown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5500.518s">[Dello Russo]</a>: However, I think that sort of a, and we had talked about this as a group, and I'm sure you remember as far as when we've, several years ago, when we got up to the point of this capital improvement program,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5519.216s">[Dello Russo]</a>: that as a council we had envisioned a visioning process that would be collaborative and something that would have open communication, clarity in goals that we then come to agreement on and reach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5541.587s">[Dello Russo]</a>: I think to a degree, we did that without going through that process, because the way government communicates in Medford isn't what one may describe as healthy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5557.539s">[Dello Russo]</a>: But we're doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5558.96s">[Dello Russo]</a>: And I think what you're trying to say, or what you are saying, is, well, then let's do that in a healthy, transparent way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5569.87s">[Dello Russo]</a>: involves participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8225.599s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. President, this gentleman, whose resume we've seen in the past, is a great citizen, a great patriot, and a great financier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8238.801s">[Dello Russo]</a>: I second the approval offered by Councilor Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8273.328s">[Dello Russo]</a>: By point of information, remind the Councilors that we have in the past been in receipt of his resume.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=1.246s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Council will come to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=6080.488s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8405.689s">[Dello Russo]</a>: As a sign of her support, I believe the mayor allocated funds for this in the legislative budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8631.737s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8632.757s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Councilor Dello Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8633.698s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Motion to accept the committee report, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8946.489s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. President, I was under the impression that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8949.472s">[Dello Russo]</a>: It was not the mayor nor the council that set water rates and fees, but it was that of the Water and Sewer Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9051.245s">[Dello Russo]</a>: I have no recollection of the council proposing or issuing a tax on the people of Medford on this matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9063.003s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Remember that we've discussed in the past 30 days a fee that has been initiated by the Water and Sewer Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=620.782s">[Dello Russo]</a>: remain open to residents only after a grant was received.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=624.625s">[Dello Russo]</a>: And the solicitor will... I don't quite understand the semantics of the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=630.569s">[Dello Russo]</a>: And I don't know if we should base our... We are waiting for an opinion from the solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=1098.441s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Councilor Dello Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=1099.702s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. President, I resent the fact that South Medford has been singled out as a place for rats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=1106.208s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Secondly, I want to thank always the Department of Public Health, which has been proactive over the years in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=1117.017s">[Dello Russo]</a>: an urban area where rats are part of the landscape, but that does not mean we have to suffer their incursions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=1125.145s">[Dello Russo]</a>: So thank you to the Board of Health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=1127.807s">[Dello Russo]</a>: We've suffered an uptick in their activity over the summer months because of some of the work done on the Green Line Extension Project, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=1138.717s">[Dello Russo]</a>: It is no doubt that the work done in the Wellington area has certainly moved some of them, and that may be exacerbated as we're entering the winter months and our little furry friends are looking for a place to bed down for the winter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=1153.824s">[Dello Russo]</a>: So I hope that the Board of Health will not only exercise their own discretion in this matter, but urge the contractors in the area who are required<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=1165.349s">[Dello Russo]</a>: to bait and monitor to step up their efforts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=1169.59s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1292.232s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. President, are we talking about, uh, item number 17 7 1 1 or 1 1 at the moment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1295.896s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1296.137s">[Dello Russo]</a>: And the vote is to, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1304.537s">[Dello Russo]</a>: remain open to residents only after a grant was received.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1373.688s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1375.118s">[Dello Russo]</a>: 7 in the affirmative, none in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1808.983s">[Dello Russo]</a>: So thank you to the Board of Health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1811.645s">[Dello Russo]</a>: We've suffered an uptick in their activity over the summer months because of some of the work done on the Green Line Extension Project, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1822.552s">[Dello Russo]</a>: It is no doubt that the work done in the Wellington area has certainly moved some of them, and that may be exacerbated as we're entering the winter months and our little furry friends are looking for a place to bed down for the winter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1853.403s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=647.196s">[Dello Russo]</a>: I have a little R after my name, so I'm the last person that wants to see people taxed, especially when they get taxed that come up from behind them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=659.019s">[Dello Russo]</a>: So this could be construed at that, but I would want to hear an explanation about this from either the treasurer or Aleesha Nunley on what our expenses are and how this is something that can, if not,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=676.317s">[Dello Russo]</a>: I wouldn't want to see people pay $50 every just to pay a bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=680.861s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Um, but I certainly, uh, uh, know that at some point, uh, to provide that, uh, so I support this, but I'd like it, uh, uh, to, uh, amend it that, uh, we get an explanation in person from, uh, the appropriate person from the, uh, city administration regarding these financial matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=704.679s">[Dello Russo]</a>: If that's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=706.603s">[Dello Russo]</a>: amenable to the presenter of the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=711.467s">[Dello Russo]</a>: In the spirit thereof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=736.044s">[Dello Russo]</a>: most things move.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=772.126s">[Dello Russo]</a>: I amended it, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=772.826s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Just to ask that we have an in-person explanation of why this is going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=781.11s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Simultaneously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=790.365s">[Dello Russo]</a>: efficiency, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=819.824s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Move approval, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=821.524s">[Dello Russo]</a>: If I may, Mr. President, as you're well aware, and I'm sure has been reported to you in why you put this on there,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=828.465s">[Dello Russo]</a>: is that we have certainly a lot of hasty driving there that has resulted in a number of bad situations, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=837.293s">[Dello Russo]</a>: And I think that would be a good place for that monitoring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=840.595s">[Dello Russo]</a>: It serves to quell and remind people of their own behaviors, especially since there's been a citywide adjustment in the speed limit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=2175.375s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=54.144s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Before we begin, may I just make one brief indication here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=59.005s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Due to the intervention of this Medford City Council, the comment period was extended with the Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs and the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs regarding the Green Line extension notice of project change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=80.27s">[Dello Russo]</a>: And so there is an additional<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=82.911s">[Dello Russo]</a>: A couple weeks, people have, they should check out the resources and to their new deadline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=90.692s">[Dello Russo]</a>: And their comments for the environmental impact on the Green Line extension to the parkway may be sent to the MEPA office, EEA number 13886, 100 Cambridge Street, Suite 900, Boston, Massachusetts, 02114.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=102.674s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Del Rosario.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=357.087s">[Dello Russo]</a>: That the city administration notify the project manager to increase mailing in the Butters neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1739.186s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1741.306s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Um, every presentation we've had on this matter from the office of energy and environment, which has been, they've been excellent presentations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1750.017s">[Dello Russo]</a>: It's quite clear to me that the Office of Energy and Environment has an agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1754.539s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Their agenda is to get METFIT into municipal aggregation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1758.701s">[Dello Russo]</a>: And so every presentation we've had has told us how wonderful and awesome and stupendous of an idea this is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1767.124s">[Dello Russo]</a>: And maybe indeed it is, but we haven't had one credible, balanced presentation of what the negatives are with it, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1777.428s">[Dello Russo]</a>: And a lot of people are concerned about that in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1780.404s">[Dello Russo]</a>: A lot of people think that it would be a good idea that we have, rather than an opt out, an opt in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1786.87s">[Dello Russo]</a>: So the city offers it, and if people in the community want to do that and get together and do it, then they should opt in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1796.238s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Now obviously the vendors have something to benefit from by getting the greater portion of the community involved in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1804.626s">[Dello Russo]</a>: They have something to gain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1806.46s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Obviously, always someone has something to gain, and there's nothing wrong with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1812.323s">[Dello Russo]</a>: I think this is a stretch in some areas, and I'm particularly concerned, Mr. President, that we'd create a list in advance of people who don't want to participate in this, who don't want to be a member of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1824.629s">[Dello Russo]</a>: What does this do to them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1826.229s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Does this target them in some way?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1827.81s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Who has an access to this list?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1829.878s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Are they going to be contacted and given a spiel to get them to come aboard?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1834.281s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Um, these are questions, uh, serious questions that I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1839.225s">[Dello Russo]</a>: These are serious questions that people in the community have, Mr. President, that they need a voice as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1845.069s">[Dello Russo]</a>: I'm going to give them that voice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1847.09s">[Dello Russo]</a>: And so I do not support this motion, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1850.192s">[Dello Russo]</a>: I think we need to have further discussion on municipal, uh, aggregation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1854.275s">[Dello Russo]</a>: And I think we need to have a credible,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1857.338s">[Dello Russo]</a>: bona fide expert on this matter who is going to give the argument contra.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1864.46s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2988.262s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. President, while we're nearing the end of the meeting, may I make a motion for suspension of the rules to address a tabled matter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2994.864s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Yes, you may.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2995.904s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. President, motion to suspend the rules to take up paper 17-764, request of the mayor to take 200 grand from free cash<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3007.745s">[Dello Russo]</a>: for the plight of the people of Brooks Estate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3010.586s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Would you like me to read the communication?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3012.767s">[Dello Russo]</a>: I wish you wouldn't, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3014.468s">[Dello Russo]</a>: We debated it extensively last week and we had a lot of words from those in favor from the gallery, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3823.547s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Point of order, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3826.568s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Point of order, Councilor Dello Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3828.308s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Can we amend or make an attachment to a financial paper as such?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3834.449s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. Clerk, is that a possibility?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4685.574s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you, sorry to interrupt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4687.416s">[Dello Russo]</a>: I'll withdraw my remarks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4751.889s">[Dello Russo]</a>: In my infirmity, Mr. President,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=550.108s">[Dello Russo]</a>: As a third generation business owner in this community, I'm delighted to see that you are taking on your family's business as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=557.054s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Congratulations, best of luck to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3967.468s">[Dello Russo]</a>: A number of things have been brought up by some of the Councilors that I'm concerned of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3971.372s">[Dello Russo]</a>: I was particularly concerned of, as Councilor Knight mentioned, a reassessment of or an examination of the groups that use our facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3982.782s">[Dello Russo]</a>: I know the Chief mentioned that this is an ongoing investigation and that's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3988.126s">[Dello Russo]</a>: There's one piece to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3993.178s">[Dello Russo]</a>: single out a person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3995.079s">[Dello Russo]</a>: I don't want to vilify anyone, Mr. Superintendent, but I can't imagine in my mind how one mislays something so important, critical, and apparently dangerous that's in a school building as bullets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4020.487s">[Dello Russo]</a>: a clip of bullets and I hope I am not asking for an answer and perhaps you can't answer that and perhaps you know right now, but I'm hoping sincerely that we get to the bottom of where these have gone and how that piece of evidence sort of has exited the scene and hope that something so grave as this is dealt with in a better way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4067.583s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5438.058s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. President, we've all had a chance to talk and ask questions, and we've heard from the superintendent and police chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5445.842s">[Dello Russo]</a>: I'd really like to see that the parents and citizens have a chance to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=695.724s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=697.685s">[Dello Russo]</a>: I want to also extend my thanks to Councilor Marks for bringing this matter up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=702.548s">[Dello Russo]</a>: If my memory serves me correctly, I think it was President Emeritus Mayorko<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=707.294s">[Dello Russo]</a>: several years ago had suggested an ordinance to deal with graffiti, and I think it got tied down in committee, and one of the sticking points to it, if my memory serves me right, was that this would sometimes, in dealing with the graffiti, one of the things that you've addressed in this is that it can often place the victims of graffiti, the property owner,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=734.798s">[Dello Russo]</a>: also has the additional burden of finding a way to deal with this, get the graffiti cleaned up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=741.903s">[Dello Russo]</a>: And for some people, whether they might own a home or a place of business, the cleanup of such an act is also a burden and may not be covered<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=753.368s">[Dello Russo]</a>: under their homeowners or business insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=757.13s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Um, so I, I'm glad that, uh, in your proposal, we have a remedy for that and, uh, you can count on my support as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3751.048s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Could I amend the motion, whatever it may be, to include a request to the mayor's office to provide each member of the Medford City Council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3764.261s">[Dello Russo]</a>: with a copy of the signed document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3793.001s">[Dello Russo]</a>: So is there a particular manner we'd like to get this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3795.823s">[Dello Russo]</a>: I'd prefer paper rather than a petroleum-based product.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4182.887s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Motion, Mr. President, to suspend Rule 33 to take papers in the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4599.508s">[Dello Russo]</a>: I was in Boston this afternoon on business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4602.75s">[Dello Russo]</a>: I had a meeting on Washington Street in the south end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4607.813s">[Dello Russo]</a>: There's a park there, a dog park, right there on Washington Street, just between where the Herald was and where the cathedral is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4616.959s">[Dello Russo]</a>: There's a little dog park that's not much bigger than the area behind this rail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4623.977s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Simple, clean, place for people to gather, let the dogs run around, play, intermingle, do whatever it is that they do, and you go home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4633.885s">[Dello Russo]</a>: It's a very simple thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4635.266s">[Dello Russo]</a>: It's not elaborate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4636.948s">[Dello Russo]</a>: It doesn't have Carrara marble colonnades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4641.812s">[Dello Russo]</a>: It's a chain link fence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4643.653s">[Dello Russo]</a>: It's got the gravel that it needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4645.315s">[Dello Russo]</a>: It's got water spigots for the dogs to drink out of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4648.177s">[Dello Russo]</a>: And that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4649.078s">[Dello Russo]</a>: And a couple benches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4650.379s">[Dello Russo]</a>: And what's that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4653.636s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Refuse bags.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4655.598s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Very nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6011.274s">[Dello Russo]</a>: helpful rather than speculating to invite them down before the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6014.637s">[Dello Russo]</a>: I don't know if we should call it a public hearing, but have them appear before the council for the purpose of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6021.543s">[Dello Russo]</a>: You know, this should be done regularly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6024.166s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Uh, excuse me for going over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6026.187s">[Dello Russo]</a>: This should be done regularly with any number of issues within this community to refresh people's memory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6059.737s">[Dello Russo]</a>: He's a gem in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6061.117s">[Dello Russo]</a>: And I don't see any reason why on earth that he wouldn't come down here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6065.168s">[Dello Russo]</a>: to have a conversation, not to be cross-examined and prosecuted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6951.003s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Councilor Dello Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6952.003s">[Dello Russo]</a>: I think Councilor Knight's recommendation is the wise one and the wise course we should follow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6958.087s">[Dello Russo]</a>: In subcommittee then that gives us the opportunity to be a little more conversational with the members of the board to get questions answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6965.231s">[Dello Russo]</a>: We can convene in council, have further deliberations among us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6971.437s">[Dello Russo]</a>: and then if we need to call them back, to ask them to come back to address further concerns, and take it from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6979.199s">[Dello Russo]</a>: It's an exceptionally wise course, and I think Councilor Penta's bringing this to our attention is important for us to have this opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8273.972s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Just an interesting statistic, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8276.534s">[Dello Russo]</a>: According to the official directory of 1950 for the Massachusetts Police Association, Medford at that time had a chief, two captains, five lieutenants, 10 sergeants, and 93 patrolmen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8292.325s">[Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>
