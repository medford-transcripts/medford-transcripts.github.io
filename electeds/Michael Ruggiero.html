 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2287.152s">It's</a> a combination of Jingle Bells and Mozart.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4293.296s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4297.5s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4298.821s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5211.694s">Thank</a> you so much for the great honor to serve the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5216.117s">I</a> have to thank both my kids and my wife, who often sometimes, you know, they have to sacrifice a little bit of their daddy so I can give up time. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5225.363s">And</a> it's been a great honor. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5227.004s">Thank</a> you so much, Mayor Burke and Madam Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5229.586s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2019-12-17_cflR-3VqII8/2019-12-17_cflR-3VqII8.html">Medford School Committee meeting November 18, 2019</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4615.887s">Thank</a> you so much for this report, and it's great that we're seeing the cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4620.132s">I'm</a> just curious, are we going to also be using this funding to improve the intercom system, or is that going to be?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4634.782s">And</a> so would teachers that are in the rooms that don't have intercom access, would they be given a radio, or?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5634.7s">Thank</a> you so much for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5636.561s">So</a> first, how many open staffing positions do we have currently?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5698.04s">So</a> it's not just 70 divided by 13? <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5699.142s">Absolutely</a> not.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5743.875s">So</a> if someone comes, they get a job? <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5745.696s">Is</a> that how it'sâ€”if they pass all the Cori checks?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5795.752s">So</a> in terms of volunteers, because I noticed on the back page it talked about middle school volunteers and such. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5800.939s">Have</a> you talked to any people in the senior center or any seniors to come down or perhaps we could do a tax deferment program?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5831.288s">So</a> are parents, are parents asked to be volunteers as well?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5840.748s">Well,</a> I mean, I would imagine, so let's say, for example, you are one of these parents that's on a waiting list right now, and so you have to do the calculation. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5848.656s">Someone</a> says, well, you come in one day a week, and that'll cover your waiting list spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5855.142s">That</a> seems like a reasonable request, or we could say the certain ratio of so many days volunteering guarantees a position.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5862.989s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5884.474s">Well,</a> I mean, I understand that this idea that co-op might not work, but it'd be interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5888.094s">When</a> was the last time a letter was sent to parents saying that there's a need? <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5892.335s">If</a> you do happen to have a couple of days that are free, it'd be great if you could help out with the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5898.458s">Has</a> any of the outreach been done to the PTOs or to the parents?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5914.546s">It</a> might surprise you if it perhaps, I mean, make a suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5917.287s">I</a> don't want to criticize the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5919.088s">I</a> know you do a lot of good work, but perhaps it would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5922.129s">to</a> let parents know that if they could put in a little bit more time, especially to the PTOs, if you happen to have one or two evenings a week free, it would be helpful, and then we could start servicing more children, not perhaps with a promise, but just letting people know, you know, if we get more help, we're going to get more help. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5938.617s">The</a> second line of questioning I had to do with the paragraph that talked about tuition, are there any children who are, cannot receive, <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5949.911s">They</a> can't be a part of the program because they don't have the money.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5958.479s">And</a> so, because I guess I'm referring to, unfortunately we know that there's a wait list for vouchers at the state level for parents that qualify, and new state regulations have made the staff requirements reporting process extremely cumbersome. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5973.59s">Could</a> you speak to that a little bit? <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5974.95s">Because</a> it really does sound like there are parents that are trying to participate in the program, waited a long time to be, and then they just sort of got bumped because they couldn't, the state voucher system changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5986.658s">Has</a> that happened?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6027.084s">I</a> wonder if I could call... It's possible you could just hand them a mailer and say, could you please send this to people on the list, letting them know that... Because I guess my concern with the program is threefold. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6038.811s">First,</a> I want to echo what Member Ruseau said. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6040.913s">I</a> mean, talking to many parents, they just don't bother applying because why climb a mountain that you're not even going to be able to get to the top of? <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6047.697s">So</a> there's that issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6049.639s">And</a> parents that would like to participate in the program, they find themselves just finding other options. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6054.962s">It's</a> not worth the hassle and maybe the issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6059.566s">But</a> I'm also worried that there are families that need this support, and we're not getting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6067.451s">I</a> mean, I guess they come in two flavors. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6071.334s">After</a> school, you have students that are there <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6073.916s">that</a> their parents want them to participate and they need a little help. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6076.477s">And</a> then there's parents that kind of need their kids to be there for them to work that second job to put bread on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6082.459s">So</a> I just want to make sure that we're reaching out to those families.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6103.245s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6103.405s">And</a> I understand that there might be information that you're not privy to but I mean I just say look I'll make you a Xerox. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6109.131s">Here's</a> a bunch of pages handed out to your members because I mean it seems like you know my family we also use after school services but we can find options. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6118.841s">There</a> are other families that you know single moms that just don't have that option.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=7030.455s">Suggestion</a> to the amendment to the motion, I would like to have a cost-benefit analysis of what it would have cost to do complete enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=7037.478s">It's</a> not impossible. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=7038.639s">Other</a> districts have done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=7040.219s">It's</a> going to cost us more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=7041.82s">It's</a> possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=7042.841s">I</a> would like to know how much it costs, because I think it's an opportunity for our community to step above and beyond what other communities in our region do, but also recognize that other school districts in America are able to pull this off. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=7056.147s">I</a> think we can too. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=7057.207s">So</a> I would like to know, I would like to suggest <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=7059.568s">that</a> in addition to understanding where we are now, I would like an actual assessment of what this would cost us to have full enrollment, or if any kid has a need to have an after school program, we can address that need.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=7074.898s">Yeah,</a> it's an amendment or it'll be a separate motion if she doesn't want to.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=7081.122s">Okay,</a> that's fine.<h2><a href="../2019-10-23_UR250MtFq2M/2019-10-23_UR250MtFq2M.html">Medford School Committee meeting October 21, 2019</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1326.667s">Thank</a> you, Mayor Burke, and thank you very much for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1330.37s">So</a> going through the list of resignations here, I noticed that our nutritionist retired. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1335.974s">So</a> who's current, do we have any backup nutritionist, or is Rhetta the only one?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1345.842s">So</a> are we anticipating on hiring someone new? <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1348.805s">And</a> if so, when are we going to post the position?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1371.906s">Yeah,</a> I mean, my concern is that not having a nutritionist on staff for the entire district I think is not a great idea as we're piloting a new program like you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1382.934s">So</a> I seriously would like to suggest that we start looking to fill that position as soon as possible or find some sort of solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1390.64s">Secondly,</a> just I suppose a little greedy for me, I mean, who's gonna be taking care of the blueberries in the middle of the high school? <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1397.625s">Do</a> we know what's going on with the outdoor,
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1407.77s">So</a> right now we don't.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1411.912s">I</a> know. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1412.292s">She</a> was just taking it on. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1413.533s">I</a> know she did a lot of work, including making hummus for the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1417.414s">This</a> is concerning to me, especially with some other information that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1424.978s">So</a> I just would like to be updated when we find out more about it and when we're going to be filling out the role.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4477.055s">Thank</a> you, Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4477.835s">And</a> thank you very much for all the hard work on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4480.596s">I</a> know this is not just important to me, but our entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4484.778s">I</a> do have a couple of questions really quick about the initial observations of the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4490.021s">So</a> September 16th, you said, that we did the initial map testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4494.723s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4496.224s">So</a> can you give us a sense of, it was the REI score, was that one? <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4502.347s">Or</a> is it RET? <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4503.328s">Sorry.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4506.009s">R-I-T.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4506.929s">So</a> on that score, is dyslexia viewed as sort of a place on the spectrum? <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4514.072s">Or</a> is dyslexia, how is dyslexia exactly tested? <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4518.034s">Because</a> that's sort of an either or type of prognostic measure versus sort of like a value on a bell curve.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4574.863s">So</a> what we're looking at here is sort of a battery of different skills, and so if a kid sort of, for lack of a better word, bombs a bunch of regions or domains on those skills, then they're forwarded to someone, or how would that work?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4679.498s">I</a> guess my concern with the issue, and I have no doubt on the abilities of the staff to handle these issues, but being able to address dyslexia is a serious concern that people devote an entire medical career to, basically. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4694.135s">So</a> you have someone who knows how to handle these kids versus sort of a generalist. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4698.92s">you</a> know, environment that you would have from the teachers address these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4702.784s">Because,</a> I mean, there's certainly a difference between reading difficulty and dyslexia. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4707.669s">And</a> I guess that's what I'm trying to suss out here on these metrics you're bringing ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4714.736s">Like,</a> if you see, like, five red flags, <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4717.318s">Do</a> you say, OK, so we'll give this kid a couple of months to try to, we'll really focus, we'll bring in some coaches or whatever it takes to get this kid moving, or do we start moving that information ahead with the parents, say, look, this child might need help outside of school in addition to the work that we're doing inside of school, and we've got to figure out a partnership. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4739.176s">Do</a> you understand the question I'm trying to say?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4823.69s">And</a> I think it's important that we recognize this as a committee, that we're not screening for dyslexia, we're screening for reading ability. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4831.395s">And</a> so the question I have would be, let's say, for example, you give a student this test and they don't do very well for whatever reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4841.422s">So</a> intervention is applied. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4843.464s">When</a> is the next test happen?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4906.996s">Does</a> that help? <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4907.876s">I</a> certainly do not doubt the ability and the hard work of our teachers, but I think the reason why we're having this conversation now is the recognition that some kids slip through the cracks. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4918.823s">I</a> mean that some children who had dyslexia weren't identified in maybe the quickest way possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4926.088s">Or</a> maybe we could do a better job of identifying earlier to make sure that these kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4930.631s">So</a> what I'm trying to get a hold of is what is the educational roadmap. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4936.234s">So</a> I understand a kid, let's say a kid doesn't do great in fall, he doesn't do great in winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4942.098s">Let's</a> say he doesn't do great in spring either. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4944.96s">When</a> do we begin to start huddling up and say, <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4948.422s">well,</a> maybe this child is dyslexic and that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4951.883s">I</a> mean, it's not, it's just a different way of thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4954.323s">It's</a> so we need to address something outside of school or some other technique. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4959.145s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5054.61s">No,</a> and I completely understand what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5056.872s">So</a> my son is sick, for example, let's say he has a cough. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5059.614s">We</a> take him to the doctor. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5061.095s">The</a> doctor runs a battery of screens and maybe prescribes him an antibiotic. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5066.059s">But</a> if he's still sick in a number of other weeks, then we do other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5069.622s">I</a> have no doubt what you're all trying to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5072.985s">I</a> guess one of the things that's not clear to me is the course by which it goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5077.969s">And</a> I understand it's certainly <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5079.83s">somewhat</a> you play it by the kid, so each kid's a little different. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5083.372s">I</a> understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5084.513s">But</a> it's important for me to understand that after, let's say, eight or nine months of intervention, we're not going anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5090.476s">There's</a> sort of a stopgap or a necessitated next move that we have to make sure, because I mean... So we don't let it go that long. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5099.081s">I'm</a> sure you wouldn't.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5124.555s">I</a> guess so as I'm talking to different people, there is the perception or belief or parents have this experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5132.038s">And</a> I'm trying to make sure that we don't have the experience where someone had to pay for their own assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5138.561s">They</a> told the kids just a little has a little trouble with reading or will never be a novelist or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5144.244s">These</a> are words the parents will tell me that was was told to their child. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5147.765s">They</a> paid for an intervention, and now they're actually working with an outside consultant to make sure that that child has the help they need, and they're catching it in the sixth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5156.673s">I</a> have no doubt. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5157.594s">I</a> mean, I'm a teacher myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5159.095s">I</a> understand when you have a classroom of students, sometimes maybe their dyslexic kids can often be very bright and very good at hiding and shielding their certain inabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5173.088s">So</a> I guess I just want to make sure when I talk to this parent, I can say to them, well, these things won't happen anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5179.334s">We</a> have a new screening program and we have a new roadmap to making sure that kids get the process and the help that they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5187.082s">Does</a> that make sense?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5195.47s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5196.091s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5197.232s">And</a> I want to make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5198.954s">Oh,</a> Madam Superintendent.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5436.72s">And</a> I think it's important to recognize I'm not other members that would like to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5441.123s">Well</a> let me ask a few more questions member. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5444.165s">I</a> wanted to get a sense of the early assessments that have been taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5447.366s">I</a> mean can you give us a sense of what percentage of children have been identified with needs or certain deficits and reading skills.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5472.495s">Okay,</a> so yeah, it would be really great to hear an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5475.278s">Thank</a> you so much for all the hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5477.66s">I</a> really do appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5478.701s">I</a> think it's great that we're doing the screening now. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5481.023s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6140.968s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6143.594s">I</a> just want to follow up on Paul's point. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6146.757s">Is</a> data collected about our students unbeknownst to them or is there any personalized information that Lexia will then harvest on our students? <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6156.768s">I</a> assume they won't. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6157.649s">I</a> hope they won't.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6164.376s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6165.951s">In</a> terms of, I just wanted to get one second because as we were talking about this letter that goes out to all parents, are the different areas of testing necessarily aligned between the maps and Lexia? <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6177.098s">I</a> mean, I imagine like phonemes are in there somewhere and sentence comprehension is in there somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6182.762s">So</a> there's <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6183.903s">broad</a> areas that could be used when you send this report to parents and saying, we're concerned about sentence comprehension, but we're on it and we're focused on these particular materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6193.471s">Could</a> something like that be done?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6773.17s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6776.772s">We</a> get the RFP in hand?

 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1237.377s">Thank</a> you, Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1238.859s">Two</a> quick questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1240.041s">I</a> just want to know, so we're all set with all the air compressors and the HVAC, or are we still in process of repairing a number of them all?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1248.573s">OK,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1249.554s">And</a> what is, this is on page seven, what CDW government
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1998.405s">I</a> really think this is a great program. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2001.526s">I'm</a> really glad that we're doing it in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2004.587s">There</a> was something I saw about a month ago on a frontline program, and I wanted to mention it to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2008.709s">I</a> don't know if this would help your work. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2010.729s">It</a> was about community policing. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2012.51s">And</a> what they were talking about in the program was how many interactions within some communities with the police is always negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2019.732s">the</a> police are coming in to often make what has appeared to be difficulties as they solve problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2026.497s">One</a> of the solutions that this program recommended was for police to offer tickets for good behavior. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2032.181s">So</a> if they see children in parks doing something, just like having fun, not loitering, not being destructive, giving tickets for positive behavior and trying to make the interaction with police, especially in communities that have, unfortunately, more interactions with police, more positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2049.192s">And</a> I don't know if that suggestion would help you, but I thought it was a really great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2053.797s">I</a> know, I think it was the police department, either Sacramento or Oakland, California, had used this particular program to great effect, to create more community interaction with police in a positive light, rather than, you know, a cop comes to your house because there's a community disruption.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2895.011s">Yeah,</a> in terms of the free breakfast program, I've been hearing a couple of issues I just wanted to clarify with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2903.238s">So</a> are these just like cereals that we're offering or what? <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2907.382s">They're</a> pretty, they're robust.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2975.553s">Yeah,</a> I know the report is not officially out yet, but could you give us a sense of what the participation rate is, just a ballpark figure?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3757.808s">Thank</a> you, Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3759.55s">Thank</a> you very much for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3760.612s">You've</a> done a great job trying to keep this stuff up. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3762.974s">My</a> one concern is- Well, it's not just me, by the way.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3770.363s">Fair</a> enough.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3772.205s">I</a> do have one little concern to sort of branch off what Member Ruseau was talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3776.167s">Let's</a> see something, say something out. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3778.629s">That</a> phrase carries a police connotation to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3781.57s">When</a> I hear that, I think I see something on a subway that looks suspicious, and I'm going to report it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3786.953s">But</a> my concern is that it's going to go into one giant bucket. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3791.335s">So</a> there's going to be the broken light, linoleum that's a little warped, with what could be a serious security concern in that same place.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3829.981s">It's</a> not just because of the way you were describing it a second ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3834.786s">What</a> I'm trying to say is I apologize.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3847.901s">Right,</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3848.461s">And</a> a light is a security measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3850.462s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3850.742s">I</a> just want to make sure that we're going to be able to separate the signal from the noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3853.783s">Like,</a> obviously a broken light is important, but a suspicious bag is more important.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=4180.012s">Thank</a> you, Mayor Burke, and thank you very much for your commitment to improving our math curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=4186.254s">I</a> would just like to suggest, as you're walking through, if we can get an update on how you feel like our ELL instruction in the math environment is doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=4194.197s">As</a> I voiced earlier today, it's an area I think is of concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=4198.498s">And</a> I would be very interested to hear about your thoughts in this regard about how we, because I think, you know, the reason why we're suffering in our percentages is this one, a couple of areas, and that's one of them.<h2><a href="../2019-09-25_35_tTrt91mM/2019-09-25_35_tTrt91mM.html">Medford School Committee meeting September 23, 2019</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=428.362s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=429.544s">Thank</a> you, Joseph. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=430.547s">Let</a> me shake your hand.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=454.397s">Thank</a> you very much, Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=455.478s">I</a> just wanted to say that when I originally saw the images online and I read about them in ScienceDaily.com when I first saw them, I was just blown away by the images. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=465.622s">And</a> it's just really exciting for me to know that our hometown made a little contribution to that moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=471.385s">I'd</a> just like to know, Joseph, can I ask you a couple of questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=473.966s">Yeah,</a> sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=474.346s">Yeah,</a> I'd just love to know, what in particular was your contribution to the project?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=533.601s">That's</a> amazing.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=536.343s">Absolutely</a> amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=537.603s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=538.684s">Can</a> you just help us understand why this is so special and why it's so difficult for, why this discovery hasn't been made before?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=583.88s">And</a> can you tell us the location, how many light years away it is?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=612.04s">That's</a> absolutely amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=612.761s">For</a> someone who's not prepared to speak, you certainly do know the topic very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=616.864s">It's</a> very clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=617.824s">I</a> would like, I'm sure this invitation is already being extended. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=620.747s">The</a> discovery was extraordinarily, I mean, was inspirational to me, and I'm sure a number of our other students would love to see your work and see some pictures. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=628.092s">I</a> imagine a number of science students were very excited about black holes. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=632.916s">I've</a> never actually seen them, because my son's first word was actually black hole, because I subjected him to all the videos. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=640.221s">I</a> think that there are a lot of students that would be really inspired by what you've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=643.325s">Thank</a> you so much for what. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=644.406s">I</a> really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=645.187s">Thank</a> you all.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2057.984s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2058.964s">Thank</a> you for the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2059.665s">I</a> have a couple of questions about excused absences. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2063.787s">Let's</a> assume for a moment we had a child with extraordinary abilities, perhaps they were like a chess master at a very young age, and they had a tournament to attend and it conflicted with school hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2074.173s">Would</a> that student be able to receive an excused absence to attend a tournament?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2090.188s">But</a> I assume the administration wouldn't penalize a child.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2146.423s">Right,</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2148.664s">I'm</a> slightly disappointed by the stance our schools took for a couple of reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2154.047s">While</a> I certainly understand member Van der Kloot's thought that we need to review the policy and change the policy and perhaps the direction that we should move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2164.312s">The</a> whole point of this walkout is to draw attention to the fact that adults aren't solving this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2171.756s">And</a> the fact of the matter is that by not sort of excusing these absences, we're actually providing almost proof to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2183.042s">Look,</a> it's more important for you to go <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2185.663s">practice</a> with your color than deal with the fact that the oceans might rise by a couple of feet in a couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2192.29s">That</a> is, I think, ultimately what disappoints me the most about the school's proposition. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2198.256s">I</a> mean, to sort of echo what member Ruseau mentioned, we would not excuse students to attend a hate rally. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2206.306s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2206.746s">I</a> mean, that's, that, no, it's not the question, just like a child who is a chess prodigy, we'd all get together and say, you know, this kid's doing well in school, we'll make sure they make up their material, or a child that's going to Spain, perhaps, we'll make sure that they make up their material, they won't miss any schoolwork, and we'll give them excused absences. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2225.342s">That</a> position could have been taken here. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2228.504s">And</a> I guess that's what I find <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2231.863s">There</a> is wiggle, I mean, once again, we don't have the policy at hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2235.445s">But</a> we as a community, as a country and a world, have to recognize that there are things that are more important than words written on paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2244.169s">And</a> we need to, if we have the capacity to, just like I'm sure in Boston, they don't have a only climate activism is excused. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2253.773s">And</a> just sort of one last point in this regard. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2257.015s">I</a> also think it's a little, <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2259.898s">I</a> don't necessarily know whether teachers should be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2263.222s">I</a> mean part of the idea of this walkout is for students to express their anger and frustration about what we as adults are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2272.313s">You</a> know and we all share responsibility in what's happening in our world right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2277.5s">So</a> I think that these are important things to keep in mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2279.918s">In</a> terms of the excused absence, I think we can call it what we like. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2286.4s">We</a> should not penalize these students. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2287.86s">We</a> should excuse these absences. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2290.441s">People</a> should not be made to feel like, oh, I have to choose between my world or a bunch of kids I play football with that I really love. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2297.362s">That's</a> not a fair choice.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2648.467s">I</a> support where member Van der Kloot is going with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2651.928s">I'd</a> like to offer a friendly suggestion or two amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2654.97s">I</a> would like to excuse the 1% of students right now that did not attend school on that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2662.612s">The</a> 1% that you said there was a dip. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2665.494s">I</a> would like to excuse all students that did not attend school that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2669.946s">I</a> think that makes more sense than, if we're going to start actually beginning to take action on what's happening on climate, I think then we have to recognize in talking about policy, about which students need to be excused when, I don't necessarily think that, that addresses the issue to the spirit of what the students are trying to protest. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2690.616s">And</a> I would like to stand behind them in any way possible, and this is the way I think we can do it.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2799.346s">We</a> don't have the policy in front of us to tweak it. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2801.908s">We</a> need language to tweak it. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2819.243s">And</a> that is the action that we critique. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2821.985s">We're</a> talking about 1% of students, if there were some students that were sick that day, but not sick enough to go to the doctor, okay, we'll count them among them. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2829.368s">We'll</a> count them among the excused. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2830.789s">I</a> don't think there's going to be some sort of huge consequence to this behavior. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2834.551s">And</a> I don't think that we're setting some sort of awful precedent that if people want to go to Charlottesville and hit someone else in the car that we're somehow supporting them. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2842.134s">And</a> I think this, with all due respect to the committee, and with all due respect, I think it sends more of a message to our support of the students, that if we vote now and excuse all the students that weren't able to, that have unexcused absences on the book, now we can do that as a committee, rather than send it to a subcommittee where we talk about it and it comes again in like four weeks.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2890.191s">I'm</a> sorry.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2996.422s">I</a> suppose that this is my reservation in all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3002.944s">While</a> I deeply understand students, they wanted to go, they were worried that they would get an unexcused absence. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3008.506s">And</a> now we're going to retcon it in retroactive.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3019.79s">Maybe</a> that's something that will actually, they'll remember that they had a moment when they could have gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3027.653s">They</a> could have standed out for the climate. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3031.017s">But</a> they were worried about some sort of consequence or inconvenience or problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3035.782s">And</a> maybe next time they are more willing to actually stand up for the environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3042.05s">Maybe</a> next time they're more willing to move forward with this.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3048.377s">I</a> think I'll let it pass for now.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3635.302s">Thank</a> you, Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3636.863s">I</a> just would like to ask that when the plan is proposed, we have options. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3642.648s">It's</a> not like this is what we think is the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3645.791s">I</a> thought that the process that we went through for the superintendent search was excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3651.436s">And</a> I just want to make sure that it doesn't go to a subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3654.238s">You</a> guys present us a book, and we vote on it, and we're done. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3657.24s">It's</a> something I thoroughly hope that we can all be involved in, because these are serious decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3662.542s">And</a> I commend member Rousseau for doing research on this regard, because that's useful for me to know as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3668.924s">So</a> I would like to maybe suggest that we add a mandate to this subcommittee, that they provide us with maybe three different plans, or... Just for general information, a feasibility study would have to happen at some point.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4717.903s">Thank</a> you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4718.424s">Khan,</a> for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4720.245s">I</a> want to ask some questions about illustrative math. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4722.486s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4723.206s">So</a> I think this is how it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4726.568s">So</a> when kids complete online exercises, all that information is recorded for you to look over. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4731.39s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4734.251s">So,</a> when the online classes, that information isn't compiled globally for you?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4755.771s">Oh,</a> the exercises themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4756.932s">That's</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4757.372s">We're</a> not using those. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4758.113s">No,</a> exercises themselves are on paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4760.174s">That</a> was my misunderstanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4761.195s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4761.695s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4762.475s">Do</a> we have a sense of, I remember that printouts and kids carrying binders were a key element of this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4769.36s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4769.88s">So</a> do we have a sense of how our compliance percentage is going? <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4773.543s">I</a> know it's early in the year, but I remember as a math teacher, I would have a certain percentage of kids and I'd open up their bag and all the papers would come
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4815.185s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4815.445s">Can</a> you give us a sense of how things are working so far? <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4818.126s">Obviously,</a> I know it's very early in the year.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4878.14s">Personally,</a> I think it's very exciting that we're trying a new program. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4880.32s">I'm</a> just very nervous about the implementation and I just want to make sure I have a couple questions for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4884.481s">So</a> help me understand a little bit about the pedagogy. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4887.242s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4887.663s">So</a> here we have there is a page that gives I imagine there's like a page that hits all of the modalities that they're doing sort of a guide for the lesson and then the teachers choose from like a potpourri of exercises that they feel would best fit their students that basically how these classes work.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4948.237s">And</a> do we have a sense of how the teachers, so far, so good? <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4953.218s">Is</a> that what we're hearing so far?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4979.905s">Is</a> there like a test that students are going to be administering? <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4982.446s">Or</a> is it sort of like all the teachers have a lot?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4986.569s">Oh,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4986.929s">It's</a> the PD day.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5016.848s">Thank</a> you so much for these reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5018.309s">I</a> appreciate as much information about this particular program, because I'm very excited about it.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5024.173s">And</a> thank you so much.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6107.87s">Yeah,</a> one last question. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6108.992s">I</a> forgot to ask you this, but it's on my list. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6112.055s">Do</a> we know what percentage of the two class books that are being taken out for children that don't have access to computers at home? <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6121.247s">Do</a> we know how many of those books are being checked out?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6162.497s">Yeah,</a> I mean, I imagine just sort of with the demographics, I'm sure there's some classes that it's a much higher population. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6168.881s">I</a> mean, are there lots of teachers saying, Faiz, I need books like now? <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6173.344s">Are</a> a lot of teachers bugging you about that?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6221.859s">I</a> look forward to the update. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6222.759s">Thank</a> you so much.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6699.918s">Thank</a> you for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6700.878s">This</a> was, I'm speaking for myself, but I think for the other members as well, this was very important that we work on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6708.8s">I</a> had the element of the dyscalculia, I'm mispronouncing it, of course, I'm sorry, elements of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6716.282s">Do</a> any of these screenings actually address those concerns as well, or dysgraphia is the other issue, or these are all directly, we're mostly concerned with dyslexia in these initial incidents.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6734.01s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6734.991s">And</a> in terms of the workshops being very competitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6739.615s">So</a> the idea here is that the teacher is going to attend the PD and then they're going to come and share the ideas that they learned from these workshops to all the other teachers.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6781.716s">I</a> see. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6782.636s">It</a> seems like a strange process. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6784.097s">I</a> mean, the teachers you would expect to have the professional development would be the ones that are struggling the most to address the problem in the population. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6792.702s">And</a> while I think it's great that three teachers were selected to learn this program, I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6799.105s">It'd</a> be great if we could have all the teachers attend.<h2><a href="../2019-09-11_OQKxfahlemU/2019-09-11_OQKxfahlemU.html">Medford School Committee meeting September 9, 2019</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1427.108s">I</a> think it would be great if we could have a little presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1430.35s">I've</a> seen some of the pictures of the Event Horizon Telescope and it's just amazing to actually see a black hole surrounded by all of this plasma. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1438.315s">It</a> would be great if we could get a presentation to our middle school students to get them excited.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3264.454s">I</a> want to get a sense of, do we have an idea of when the DESE guidelines will be coming out, or is that the state's unclear on that?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3277.921s">And</a> do we have a sense, is there like a preliminary report that's going to be anticipated, or it's just all coming out at once?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3359.19s">Is</a> it possible that we could have one of the administrators of the program come in to speak about what their game plan and their strategy is? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3365.113s">Because</a> right now it seems like everyone's sort of unclear about where this is moving, and this is a very serious issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3371.057s">I</a> mean, we all were very moved by the presentation that came to us about dyslexia.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3379.262s">Oh,</a> I have no doubt. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3380.322s">I</a> don't mean to imply that people aren't taking it seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3382.424s">It</a> would just be helpful to me when people call me about the issue that I have more to report other than Desi is trying a bunch of stuff out in some different communities and we'll see in a year and a half.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3406.51s">If</a> they can't, send a personnel member, at least something they can write us, so at least we have a sense of what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3412.635s">And</a> I really appreciate both of you following up on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3414.616s">So</a> thank you.

 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1219.652s">A</a> supermajority would have to agree that it is an emergency.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2204.478s">Two</a> questions as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2205.338s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2206.278s">The</a> first question I have was your mix of the opt-in versus the opt-out model that you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2212.461s">So</a> the original screening, students are just going to have the survey if they want to fill it out or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2217.663s">Is</a> that an option? <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2218.943s">But</a> if they get included in the study, it requires both consent of the student and the parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2223.467s">Is</a> that still the model that we're using?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2225.429s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2226.85s">And</a> the second question I had is, you mentioned before that it would be possible to include other questions, a couple of other questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2234.518s">It</a> would be great if we could have a question also on vaping and a question on maybe activity levels, including like diabetes and like sugary drink consumption.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2262.0s">Yeah,</a> it would be nice if we could have a question about sugary drink consumption as well, because that is a really rising health cost, as you noted.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2284.122s">Yeah,</a> I don't know if this requires an amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2286.703s">And</a> I also don't want to jeopardize the scientific value by including every single question under the sun. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2291.905s">But</a> if it doesn't actually jeopardize the scientific value of your study, I would prefer questions about obesity and sugary drink consumption and activity levels to also be included <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2302.077s">Perhaps</a> Ms.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2316.487s">Of</a> course. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2316.927s">That's</a> the most important. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2317.687s">I</a> mean, I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2318.448s">I</a> don't want you to jeopardize the scientific value of what you're doing by expanding out the scope.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2349.662s">I</a> mean, I don't think this requires an amendment, but if you could look into that for us, I'd really appreciate it.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2361.201s">Well,</a> I would imagine, I mean, I'm speculating, I don't have the scientific data in front of me, but I would imagine that children that tend to be less active and also have a poorer dietary environment <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2373.596s">also</a> have a higher likelihood to use marijuana. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2376.318s">I</a> don't know if I have any evidence of that, but it would seem at least sort of, you know, you imagine sort of the person smoking pot, watching TV, eating Doritos. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2385.326s">I</a> mean, that could be a cliche, or perhaps there's some scientific truth to that fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2388.849s">I</a> don't know.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2416.789s">Yeah,</a> the reason why I mention it is I've had a couple of parents now talk to me about, you know, their child was involved in middle school sports and they were very athletic and then the vaping and the drug use came into their lives and all of that stopped. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2431.118s">So,</a> I mean, I would be curious to see whether that correlation actually is valid or if it's just sort of like word on the street what I hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2439.509s">Thank</a> you, Doctor.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2528.074s">Free</a> breakfast, lunch feasibility.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3291.527s">So</a> thank you very much for rushing out this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3294.228s">I</a> know that we all asked you to expedite it and with all the other budgetary work that you had. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3299.951s">I</a> really appreciate it because as I mentioned before as a former educator, I know what it's like when kids show up hungry and I've seen the effects. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3307.834s">I've</a> taught at both kinds of schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3309.795s">But</a> I do share Member Ruseau's reservations about not doing an after the bell program. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3316.922s">When</a> kids have the opportunity, if mom and dad are running late, that kid doesn't eat. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3321.966s">And</a> one of the issues that we talked about at the superintendent review was making sure we have a consistent program. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3328.292s">throughout</a> the entire system. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3330.295s">I</a> guess the way I feel about it is that, you know, if you're a child in poverty, it doesn't matter whether you go to the Columbus or the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3336.662s">I</a> just want to make sure that kid's fed. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3338.544s">So</a> I would like to suggest under this pilot, since we're running a pilot, I would like to have a consistent after the bail program. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3346.692s">That</a> would be what we test, not sort of we try this, we try this, we try this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3350.694s">I</a> want to see what happens when the entire district has an after the bell program. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3355.137s">And</a> if we have something like 90% participation, then we would know that we have an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3361.286s">seeking</a> a second on that or has anyone else had a motion?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3455.581s">And</a> I believe, and I understand, it's like one more thing that member Ruggiero has thrown at the principals. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3462.166s">But</a> on this particular issue, I do believe it has a significant impact on educational standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3468.531s">And</a> it will be seen throughout the entire school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3471.013s">So</a> I would, if none of my, no one wishes to second this motion, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3474.816s">But</a> I would like to make a motion that we do a universal after the bell program for breakfast. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3481.341s">That's</a> the one we pilot. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3482.382s">And</a> if it doesn't work, <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3483.783s">If</a> we can't get it to work by November, then we can regroup and say, you know, it just didn't happen at the McGlynn because of rodents.<h2><a href="../2019-06-05_q-Y9QUDQ70c/2019-06-05_q-Y9QUDQ70c.html">Medford School Committee meeting June 3, 2019</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4276.489s">Thank</a> you, Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4277.57s">Thank</a> you very much for this presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4281.052s">I</a> did have a question on page three of the handout. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4285.103s">You</a> mentioned our lower full inclusion rate and lower subseparate rate as compared to the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4291.364s">Can</a> you tell me what the state average is and where we compare?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4301.467s">Maybe</a> I missed it in the wrong place. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4303.487s">I</a> couldn't find it. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4304.248s">So</a> I'll look for it again.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4307.108s">Great,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4309.069s">Are</a> we talking like a huge difference or small difference?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5831.343s">Thank</a> you, Mayor Burger. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5832.657s">One</a> of the questions that came up when we were doing our budget discussion earlier was students, sometimes the Chromebooks will blink out. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5841.319s">Do</a> we ever have students lose data when they do the online assistant if we have a Chromebook that blinks out? <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5845.86s">It's</a> not like they have to start from the top.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6134.577s">Thank</a> you very much, Mayor Bergen. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6135.738s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6137.289s">for</a> the report, I was hoping we could speak to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6139.291s">Caldwell</a> about it, but I appreciate you presenting in her stead. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6143.996s">First</a> off, I was curious, so in front of the curriculum committee, how many requests are made for professional development?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6156.529s">Yeah,</a> so four were granted approval, is that correct?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6190.66s">Yeah,</a> because I remember when the teachers were here speaking on this very issue, they seemed to be, almost all of them, seemed to have the impression that they've presented things and they haven't had a chance to be approved on.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6222.331s">Yeah,</a> I would, if possible, I would like to request a report to get a percentage of what our denial versus approval rate, but I have a couple of other questions in this regard as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6233.146s">In</a> terms of our tuition reimbursement, how do we compare looking at other similar school districts?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6353.542s">Yeah,</a> I mean, I can certainly, as a former educator myself, I've taken part of these conferences and I've learned a lot, but on the school committee I can also appreciate the stress to make sure that we have all these positions filled and if someone's away for a couple of days. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6368.81s">that</a> we can fill their spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6370.61s">I</a> guess the sense that I had when TA was here is that it seemed, and many people nodded, and many people expressed their dissatisfaction with the amount of conferences that they had been approved for. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6386.354s">Now,</a> whether that's true or not, I mean, I understand that you <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6391.112s">You</a> think we're being very generous?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6409.619s">If</a> possible, it would be very helpful for me, because I do have these conversations when teachers approach me. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6416.985s">ill-equipped</a> to represent the district and say, no, actually, we gave 150 conferences versus Melrose, which only gave 35, or Arlington, which only gave 85. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6426.989s">So</a> it would be very helpful for me to understand where other districts are in this regard. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6432.711s">I</a> don't know if you have a superintendent database that you would access, but if you could do us a favor,
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6451.375s">I</a> don't anticipate that you, everyone's busy doing graduations, and that would be a terrible time. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6456.597s">But</a> at your next superintendent conference, when you all meet, if you could pool five or six of our sister districts and say, how many do you guys give out? <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6465.481s">And</a> then you can report back those figures to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6467.402s">It</a> would help me. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6468.642s">When</a> a teacher finds me shopping at Wegmans and they're hitting me with that right now, I feel ill-equipped to represent. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6475.365s">I</a> mean, I think any teacher understands that there is a give and take, but on the other side, it's important for us to recognize that we are part of the voice of the schools, and it'd be helpful to me to have those numbers.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6493.432s">So</a> moved.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6496.715s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6573.58s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6576.309s">Yes.</a> <h2><a href="../2019-05-22_R-JcMFRQo7E/2019-05-22_R-JcMFRQo7E.html">School Committee meeting May 20, 2019</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1101.821s">Thank</a> you so much for bringing this to our attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1106.99s">Serving</a> issues like this is why I ran for school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1109.792s">I</a> really appreciate you bringing this to our attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1112.635s">I</a> would like to suggest that once we move forward and remove or find a better option for our community that we all can agree on, that you find something else that you think should be improved and you keep doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1123.424s">Because</a> this is one of the most exciting things about serving on this board. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1127.508s">So</a> please keep speaking up. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1129.709s">Your</a> voice is welcome here. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1131.051s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5331.618s">Thank</a> you, Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5334.079s">One</a> issue I heard come up reputedly in your state, Charlene, was the professional development funds being rejected. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5341.083s">Could</a> you give me a sense of how often this happens?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5480.957s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5481.517s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5483.122s">Mayor</a> Burke, I'd like to make a motion that we have a report on the percentage of professional development funds that are requested from us and what percentage we actually give to teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5495.905s">As</a> a former educator myself, I know how valuable professional development time is. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5500.826s">So</a> I'd like to see that in writing as a report, please.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5507.688s">The</a> percentage of teachers that have applied for professional development monies
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5546.652s">Is</a> it, so if a teacher places, thank you, I mean I appreciate it, I just want to get a sense of what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5552.114s">So</a> if a teacher makes a request for a conference or a class in the summer, that teacher's application must still be on file somewhere, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5561.637s">Even</a> if it's rejected, or not?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5637.488s">It's</a> not that they passed the expiration date of the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5640.27s">It's</a> just they weren't the first in the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5642.091s">Is</a> that what you're saying?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5643.812s">So</a> the teachers applied properly.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5719.162s">So</a> someone, let's say they went to Mass General Hospital and they wanted to receive special training to help our dyslexic students, that wouldn't necessarily be covered.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5759.218s">Yeah,</a> it would be very helpful to me just to, and thank you very much for this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5762.92s">Thank</a> you very much for sharing your concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5764.601s">I</a> just want to make sure that we can see something physical so we can actually move forward with an educated decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5770.564s">If</a> we have 100 teachers applying for 10 spots, that's unacceptable in my opinion.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5964.938s">I</a> mean, I've taught AP Calculus, so I know it's not so much always just the mathematics, but it's also the ability and getting the educational instruction to teach at a high level to high school kids who are sort of in between being at college ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5978.401s">So</a> I know those classes are particularly challenging. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5981.887s">In</a> terms, I would like to also, in addition to the report, I'd like to suggest that we review the policy in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5987.672s">Because,</a> I mean, your particular case, it seems like we should be allowed a little bit of discernment, you know, especially for seniors in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5995.137s">I</a> was just thinking the benefit would have been pretty big to the system as a whole, and just to have that experience, to read the AP exams, see what they're looking for, go back and tell. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6004.044s">On</a> our teacher, we have a huge AP offering in my school.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6235.724s">Amber,</a> is the podium microphone on? <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6237.326s">Oh,</a> I'm sorry.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9273.667s">I</a> just want to say briefly that it's been a real honor seeing you guys work with your energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9281.473s">It's</a> been a real pleasure. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9282.733s">I</a> know we have a lot going on tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9284.154s">I</a> don't want to ramble on. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9285.695s">But</a> thank you so much for coming down and making this presentation.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11166.595s">So</a> as an educator, former educator, I can tell you that there are students in Medford that the only time they have a real meal <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11174.227s">is</a> at school. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11175.608s">We</a> know that for a fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11178.511s">I</a> share member Ruseau's energy in making sure we get this done. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11185.318s">Our</a> job as a school committee member is to make sure that we're devoting the right time in the right places. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11190.582s">And</a> I completely understand that we can't get the research done in two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11195.404s">But</a> for me, I don't need to see the research, because I know that there is a significant portion of students that the only time they eat is at lunch regularly. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11204.409s">Otherwise,</a> they're just grabbing a snack maybe every so often. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11207.571s">We</a> need to make this a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11209.351s">I've</a> seen the effect it has on children. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11211.212s">I've</a> taught in both kinds of schools, schools where they have a lunch in homeroom and schools without it. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11216.795s">And</a> I can tell you there's a marked difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11221.078s">Anyone</a> else doesn't have anything else to say on this issue? <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11223.5s">I</a> think we can move the question.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11572.008s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11573.009s">That's</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11574.17s">Mr.</a> Ruggiero, did you have one last comment? <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11575.531s">I</a> withdraw my comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11576.792s">Ms.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12169.609s">So</a> on this question, so the children pulled out the <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12172.889s">the</a> questionnaire, if they are screened as heavy users, or would it also be students that aren't screened as heavy users also be included in?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12204.03s">Oh,</a> so it's going to be an equal number of non-users. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12206.071s">If</a> a child's selected, he never has to fear that he's going, because I would wonder if that would affect the methodology.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12236.46s">How</a> many students do you intend on sampling?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12251.042s">So</a> do you anticipate something like you take 125 students that are not marijuana users, 125 students that are, and that's your sample pool?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13113.117s">In</a> addition, you mentioned that on your questionnaire you can include other activities that are unhealthy. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13118.202s">I'd</a> like you to expand that net as wide as you possibly can without affecting your research significantly, including questions such as obesity, perhaps TV screen time use. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13127.811s">Is</a> it possible you can include those items in your survey?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13162.379s">It</a> was just being mindful of. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13163.835s">And</a> secondly, if we do move away from the passive consent model, will that affect the demographics of your participation? <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13171.8s">So</a> there are certain communities that won't respond because their parents won't sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13176.443s">That's</a> something that we have to recognize as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13178.564s">If</a> we're going to do a truly, a true survey, perhaps passive content is the best option. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13184.818s">appreciate</a> your concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13185.8s">I</a> have no doubt that the doctor will maintain the confidentiality of all the information that the students... And we can talk about their...
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13223.193s">I</a> would prefer we go down that line to address Mayor DiMendito's concerns, but that's where I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13231.816s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14892.732s">I'm</a> just worried.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14896.693s">Thank</a> you, Mary Brooke. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14898.794s">So</a> a number of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14900.275s">First</a> off, <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14902.154s">As</a> you know, I'm a math teacher myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14904.936s">And</a> so my concern is echoed. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14909.12s">I'm</a> concerned that we're going to have students that don't have access to technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14913.423s">The</a> printers aren't going to be working. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14914.924s">So</a> out of those 6th and 8th grade classes, how many students did not have a computer at home?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14957.113s">So</a> does the program take <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14959.981s">So</a> it monitors the students how long they are on the website, is that right?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14967.323s">Let's</a> say you have a student who's online, accessing to it.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15026.834s">So</a> I just want to know, did you have a chance to make an informal poll of how teachers and middle school teachers feel about the adoption of this new program?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15064.238s">So</a> you feel in terms of questions of morale, they're willing to follow you down?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15071.521s">I'd</a> probably follow that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15072.662s">I'd</a> follow that. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15073.922s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15073.982s">And</a> oh, shucks, I have one last question. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15077.484s">So</a> how much do each individual workbook, how much does each one cost? <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15085.387s">$26.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15085.467s">I</a> know you already said that. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15086.228s">I'm</a> just getting a little foggy inside. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15089.803s">OK,</a> so for us to get three copies per class is not unbelievably expensive.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15102.606s">You</a> seem to be of the opinion that let's just go with the binder method, see how it goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15108.607s">If</a> we need the notebooks, later we get the notebooks.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15123.831s">And</a> just one last thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15125.092s">I</a> really do appreciate your collegial disagreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15127.594s">It's</a> heartwarming at 11 o'clock at night that you have an academic disagreement, but it's always for the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15134.74s">And</a> that's very heartwarming to me to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15137.203s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2234.005s">Mr.</a> Ruggiero? <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2235.486s">Mayor</a> Burke, the story that you just shared with us, can you come back to the podium please? <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2239.868s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2243.03s">Your</a> story that you shared with us is not, I mean I've talked to other parents that have had similar experiences as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2248.993s">I'd</a> like to recommend that we, oh I'm sorry, excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2253.68s">The</a> experience that you shared with us is a story I've heard before, especially with dyslexic children. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2260.385s">And</a> to this end, in regards to what you've brought up, I would like to, at least maybe not tonight, if we can't get it on the agenda, but maybe we can do it another night where we can ask for a report for dyslexia, like a dyslexia audit from the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2274.775s">Would</a> something like that be possible, Superintendent?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2325.721s">My</a> concern would be just making sure that we're doing the best for curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2328.923s">I</a> appreciate the presentation that we're going to have tonight, but it would be useful for me to understand where we are as a community versus just research.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3896.18s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3897.201s">Thank</a> you, Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3898.481s">Thank</a> you, doctor, for this very informative presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3900.821s">There</a> are a number of things that you brought up that really interested me. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3904.985s">One</a> of the things I guess that concerns me, so we can expect, according to your research, we can expect 10% of the students in our school system at all grade levels are suffering from dyslexia. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3917.389s">Of</a> that 10%, how many, I wasn't sure if I caught it in your presentation, if I missed it, I apologize, but what percentage of students that are in that 10% category are actually aware of their dyslexia?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3936.845s">Would</a> they be medically diagnosed with... No.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3951.995s">Yeah,</a> let me clarify my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3953.597s">So</a> of the 10% that have dyslexia, <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3957.54s">How</a> many have a medical, what percentage of that 10% have a medical diagnosis of dyslexia?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3993.484s">that</a> I would like your advice on. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3995.267s">So</a> for the students that are in the sixth grade, the seventh grade, they've moved beyond their optimal time for treatment, and they're sort of, they went through the wait to fail model, I guess, and they're in the fifth grade, sixth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4008.747s">What</a> steps should we take to address those students?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4059.026s">You</a> mentioned the tablet program that you're developing right now on an iPad. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4064.349s">What</a> sort of training is necessary for teachers to quickly and adequately spot dyslexia early on so they can get the best treatment?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4108.722s">How</a> long does this little iPad quiz take or game?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4144.981s">So</a> it would be something that we could maybe Xerox off and just let the kids play with for 20 minutes?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4194.441s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4194.782s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4661.244s">Mr.</a> Ruggiero. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4662.645s">Oh,</a> just a follow-up question on the item. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4665.627s">If</a> we could just sort of work towards having an audit of where we are with the various dyslexia. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4672.31s">Our</a> next presentation is going to address many of these questions.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5998.654s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5999.976s">So</a> currently at the Roberts, can you tell me how many students have IEPs based on dyslexia right now?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=6013.319s">And</a> is this for all the elementary schools?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=6019.083s">Would</a> you have a ballpark figure?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=6028.163s">So</a> let's add that to the report as well, please.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=6056.897s">Yes,</a> yeah, I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=6058.138s">I</a> mean, it just seems back of the envelope, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=6060.799s">So</a> we have around 2,000 kids in our elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=6064.28s">So</a> we know, at least based on the research, what we've heard, that's about 200 kids that are suffering with it right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=6071.644s">So,</a> I mean, the question is, I would like to know, how many of those kids have educational plans in place right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=6079.307s">I</a> don't think that this... For dyslexia.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=6085.748s">Yes,</a> that's right, because that's what we're, the idea here is trying to address this issue, just making sure that we know where we're at, because I'm getting a sense that maybe we don't.

 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1106.629s">Yeah</a> I really like the idea that I mean of course we could always go out to bid and have a bunch of professionals look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1113.712s">But</a> I think it'd be a really fun project for a number of students to actually have an opportunity to have like a little contest. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1119.075s">Maybe</a> it's not a scholarship maybe it's an award and a plaque that we present at a school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1125.418s">But</a> regardless I'd like to make a motion that we explore this option with the superintendent and she can come back with to us with a report at her leisure.

 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5000.682s">I</a> just would like to also recommend that we put the lottery date for the middle school selection also on this calendar, if possible.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7159.285s">Thank</a> you, Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7162.287s">I've</a> noticed this on page five here. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7164.008s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7164.888s">So</a> there's a significant drop from grade three to grade four. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7169.491s">What</a> do you believe? <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7170.971s">Why</a> is that?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7238.42s">Do</a> you have a sense of, in the past when we've had these breakdowns, we've been able to see which schools have been performing at what levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7246.226s">Do</a> you have a sense, are there any, <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7249.208s">disparities</a> between different schools on these? <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7251.45s">It's</a> in the first report.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7264.081s">Oh,</a> I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7264.902s">Oh,</a> the new one that was on the desk. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7267.063s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7267.404s">Oh,</a> I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7268.605s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7269.265s">I</a> didn't catch it in the envelope.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7425.444s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7429.158s">Yes,</a> yeah, follow-up question. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7431.038s">So</a> thank you very much for this that you give us today. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7433.239s">But</a> is it possible that we could look at, in the future, or perhaps with the report that you're sending to Member Ruseau, is it possible you could do a per-subject breakdown per school? <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7443.661s">So</a> we could see that maybe we could get a couple more measurement and data specialists at the Columbus. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7449.122s">That</a> would be useful for me to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7450.843s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7451.823s">Just</a> like you've provided the aggregate data per school, it would be very useful for me to know per subject on each school.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7464.286s">By</a> strength, like geometry, measurement data, fractions, all of these, I guess, subtopics. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7469.848s">It</a> would be nice to know the breakdown per school as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7472.709s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7473.569s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7474.549s">Member</a> Ruseau, would it be okay if I added that to your motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7482.104s">make</a> another motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7482.785s">Okay,</a> then I'd like to, or unless we have to, sorry, excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7486.427s">I'd</a> like to make a motion that we have the breakdown for schools that are at the convenient, by topic, thank you.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7508.324s">No,</a> we remember.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9043.511s">Thank</a> you for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9044.491s">I</a> really appreciated the executive summary here. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9047.712s">Can</a> we just go to page four of your report, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9049.533s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9050.784s">So</a> just sort of walk me through this table at the bottom of page four. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9054.708s">So</a> there are a number of domains and clusters that are associated with them, and these are the highlights, the areas that we need work. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9061.395s">Is</a> that basically the end?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9087.373s">But</a> you don't get a whole table that says item 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9109.431s">Right,</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9110.392s">It</a> would be just useful to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9111.492s">I</a> mean, there's no rush on this, but if we could get like a PDF, save the paper of all the different items and the districts and state scores, it would just be helpful for me just to get a more complete sense of what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9124.181s">I</a> appreciate the executive summary and not like a thick binder of problem, you know, issues that we can look on now. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9129.444s">But</a> at home, it would be nice for me to look over these domain by domain. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9134.647s">And</a> if we could break that down by school, I mean, is it challenging to break down by school or just a printout? <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9140.712s">It</a> would be really helpful to me to see what areas that we could, perhaps there might be an environment that we could leverage someone in the community that has experience with something, for example, molecules to organisms.<h2><a href="../2019-03-08_qChIJ_zcV6s/2019-03-08_qChIJ_zcV6s.html">Medford School Committee meeting Wednesday, March 6, 2019</a></h2>

 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5910.689s">Mayor</a> Burke, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5912.049s">I</a> stand in opposition to this plan for many of the reasons that Member Ruseau mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5918.931s">First</a> off, I think that it's part of my fiduciary responsibility to the city of Medford to review these items in part of our working group. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5927.293s">I</a> feel like this can be done as in committee of the whole and I dislike the idea that <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5935.235s">If</a> I attend these meetings, it will be simply informational. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5939.718s">With</a> all due respect to members that are on this committee, I'm sure they do a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5943.781s">But</a> I think I owe it to the citizens of Medford to be able to speak on these matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5950.926s">And</a> I dislike the idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5952.587s">While</a> I understand that items that come to us, <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5956.23s">We</a> would have the opportunity, it would come to us as an omnibus agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5960.914s">And</a> yeah, I think that this is the wrong direction while I understand the attempt and the idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5966.878s">I</a> believe that all of us should be present at these meetings and it's very possible perhaps we could schedule these from 6 to 7.30 before Monday or other times.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6018.182s">Yeah,</a> while I completely understand your point.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6025.535s">I</a> mean, it's part of my job. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6027.136s">I</a> mean, it's difficult for me to, it was difficult for me to attend today's committee of the whole, but I made it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6032.099s">It</a> was, other members couldn't come in at exactly the right time. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6035.101s">They</a> were five or six minutes late. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6036.982s">It's</a> understandable. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6037.762s">These</a> are important matters, and I do believe that our entire meeting should deliberate.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6460.95s">I</a> think that there's a number of items I wish to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6464.032s">The</a> first was the question, well, what's this personnel subcommittee for? <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6468.737s">Well,</a> in my opinion, a great use for it would be to decide if we want a badminton coach and a conversation about a team or a new team and how that individual personnel should be hired. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6484.238s">The</a> underlying premise that seven of us can't sit down together and have a thoughtful conversation about these topics is somewhat, for lack of a better word, almost offensive to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6493.866s">I</a> think we can do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6495.548s">It's</a> not like seven of us can't get into a room. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6498.25s">A</a> quorum of our subcommittee is four people, for God's sakes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6502.694s">If</a> Kathy can't be there because of a family emergency, we'll survive. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6506.817s">You</a> know, this body will continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6509.738s">But</a> in terms of questions of collaboration and conversation, I'm excited that our new superintendent wants to create a more transparent process, and I support the motivation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6520.921s">And</a> while I am very frustrated by this proposal, I understand where it comes from. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6526.203s">However,</a> I do not, we can all sit down in a committee of a whole or if we needed something less formalized, we could do something like a dialogue that we had earlier in the year where we can just sort of throw ideas on the board and see what sticks. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6543.71s">That</a> is within our purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6546.251s">And</a> I also do believe with respect to member Rousseau that we are not the weirdo in this case. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6553.334s">I</a> think actually using, <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6555.996s">a</a> process where the community has an opportunity to see what's going on in front of a camera versus a subcommittee meeting which might not. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6564.944s">I</a> don't think that that fosters added senses of transparency for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6570.77s">So</a> again, while I'm very frustrated by this proposal and I do believe it's the wrong direction, <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6578.057s">I</a> understand the motivation, and I appreciate the idea that you want to create a more collaborative, a more transparent environment, but we have a forum to have collaborative conversations in a transparent environment, and this is it.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6688.524s">I</a> mean do we have a quorum for a committee if I'll go I mean look I mean The chair right now
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6921.657s">In</a> the evening, if possible, at 6 o'clock, sometime around that.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6969.17s">I</a> know. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6970.011s">Sorry,</a> Nicole. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6971.294s">Wasn't</a> she in earlier? <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6972.476s">I</a> had her up at the podium.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=7608.128s">So</a> I'm interested in your mentioning about the assessment that's going to be at the graduation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=7615.51s">So</a> is this an assessment similar to the MCAS? <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=7617.871s">Is</a> that going to be the design paradigm?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=7672.256s">I</a> also assume new educational materials will have to be purchased.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=7683.201s">Has</a> the state offered any financial support?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=7726.714s">One</a> last question.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=7727.374s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=7730.054s">Have</a> DESE published the core curriculum, the actual topics that will be tested on this exam, like the different modalities?<h2><a href="../2019-02-25_TWpH9s-16mQ/2019-02-25_TWpH9s-16mQ.html">Medford School Committee February 11, 2019 meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1864.715s">If</a> possible, I mean, I would really like to attend these meetings because I'm very interested in this particular topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1870.546s">I</a> would prefer it to be as a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1873.268s">I</a> understand perhaps we could vote on that now or we could discuss that.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4897.053s">This</a> was a major issue to me when I was campaigning for school committee, and I'm really glad to see the beginning motions of resolving the problem, especially the economic and social disparities between the two schools I've always found very troubling. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4911.278s">I</a> do have a couple of questions about it, however. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4914.682s">Given</a> that some teachers have after school programs at some schools versus other, will students at the McGlynn be able to take an after school program at the Andrews and vice versa?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4954.779s">And</a> also I was concerned before the issue was joining the two schools or having a random lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4961.217s">was</a> that there were programmatic reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4963.038s">For</a> example, English learners were assigned to one school and other environments. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4967.482s">Will</a> those considerations still apply?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5010.677s">Yeah,</a> I think there's a lot of, I think ultimately this will be this, unless we make a true difference between the two schools, where one has a magnet for one environment and another has a magnet for another environment, which is an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5022.29s">perhaps</a> we should explore, but this probably is the fairest option to make sure that we don't have the same economic disparities that we have now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5029.872s">However,</a> I would like to know more about the rollout of this program, and I'd like to make a motion that we have a committee of the whole meeting where we talk more about this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5037.495s">I</a> think it's excellent, and I think this is a great start. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5040.015s">I</a> just would like to have more material at hand to see sort of all the steps and implementation, and I want to make sure we can have a forum for community participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5048.792s">before</a> we make an official vote on this plan.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5054.816s">I</a> want to understand a little bit more about the implementation, and I would like to make sure that the community has an opportunity to buy into the process versus something that's just a surprise at the end of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5064.102s">Because</a> people are right now, at least two years ago, we're used to being able to choose. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5069.146s">And</a> that's something that we are going to say, well, you know, it wasn't working for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5073.349s">We're</a> changing the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5074.589s">Here's</a> why. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5075.973s">I</a> just want to make sure that the community has an opportunity to participate in that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5081.656s">So</a> is there a second for my motion?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5757.417s">My</a> concern is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5759.798s">I</a> think that we absolutely, most of us can agree that the system that we have now is not working. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5766.222s">is</a> I think that there's another option that might be worth exploring, and that would have a magnet school for one environment, and a magnet school for, let's say, math or science, and a magnet school for language arts or humanities.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5783.73s">I</a> understand completely, but it would be, once again, to get a sense of rollout, I think is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5788.592s">And</a> if you have four friends, and you have a cohort of four peers that you've always been with, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5795.515s">for</a> whatever reason, it's not mathematically impossible. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5798.578s">I</a> mean, it's probable that there will be groups of friends split up where one kid's at one school and the rest of the group's at the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5805.004s">It's</a> just going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5806.906s">And</a> these are options. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5808.667s">I</a> just want to make sure that we're making the right choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5810.983s">If</a> this is a one-year kind of deal while we discuss other things, I'd be a little bit more comfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5816.325s">But</a> once again, I mean, I certainly share the superintendent's concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5821.126s">It</a> was an important issue for me during the campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5823.667s">And</a> it's still an important issue for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5825.728s">I</a> just want to make sure that we're doing this in the right way and exploring all options versus like, oh, this is the new normal. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5832.31s">Let's</a> all do it now.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6681.064s">I</a> think it's important to recognize there are a lot of questions that still are up in the air. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6686.33s">Like,</a> for example, how we are doing some programmatic switches between some kids, if they have EL, are going to go to this school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6694.6s">Some</a> kids with other needs are going to go to this school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6697.703s">I</a> mean, these issues are up in the air. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6699.545s">While</a> I have complete faith <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6701.423s">in</a> the superintendent, I think it's important for us to suss these questions out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6706.227s">Member</a> Mustone, I completely understand your frustration, and I know that you just want to go, and I get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6712.551s">But</a> I don't think delaying this two weeks, a week and a half, for us to have a committee of the whole is going to destroy the program rollout. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6721.778s">I</a> just don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6722.599s">I</a> think that it would be important for us to take a breath. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6725.981s">We</a> have a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6727.362s">but</a> to take a beat, think about this problem all together, and we're probably all going to, once we answer our questions, we're probably all going to agree that this is the right, this is the best thing for Medford, perhaps. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6738.91s">But</a> I think that we do need a little more time to think about this.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6760.362s">We're</a> not talking about five months.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8069.256s">Yes,</a> thank you, Mayor Burke, and thank you very much for this presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8072.815s">I'm</a> very impressed by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8074.276s">The</a> idea of emergency preparedness is important to begin with. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8077.457s">And</a> as you mentioned, it's important to think of it when times are good. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8080.758s">And</a> oftentimes, it's easy to forget that there are students, like you mentioned, sometimes they trip and fall, and they just have trouble walking for a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8087.6s">And</a> other students that need a little bit more assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8091.801s">Madam</a> Superintendent, do we have a district-wide emergency preparedness committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8097.443s">And</a> would one be able to be formed?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8123.477s">where</a> we were talking about safety in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8127.299s">Do</a> you think that such an implementation would be possible for you to do with your staff?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8138.226s">I'd</a> like to make a motion to send this to the superintendent for report to see if we could convene a district-wide emergency preparedness committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8146.452s">And</a> also to forward these recommendations to her so she could report back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8150.613s">I</a> think that there's a lot of great work here, and I really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8153.254s">Thank</a> you so much.<h2><a href="../2019-01-16_1uNjYgTELYs/2019-01-16_1uNjYgTELYs.html">January 14, 2019 Medford School Committee meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=743.404s">Before</a> the tabling, I just have a couple of questions about the formatting, because I had a similar concern or idea, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=749.165s">Is</a> it possible, if not department heads, or different departments, is it possible for us to list the departments that they receive their paycheck from?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=874.709s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=874.929s">Can</a> you still ask questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=876.99s">So</a> I'm just trying to understand the data frames that you draw this from. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=880.527s">So</a> to pull out this spreadsheet here, these columns, you drew that from your payroll system, is that correct?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=907.701s">Well,</a> I guess the reason why I'm trying to understand the challenge of this <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=910.622s">So</a> you have these numbers also cross-referenced to another data frame that where the warrants are drawn from that pay all these people, right?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=923.145s">So</a> what I'm trying to understand is that if there's someone being paid, let's say, in the high school, <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=931.318s">How</a> do they draw their check? <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=932.919s">They</a> draw their check from just payroll and that's where it's come from? <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=936.721s">Or</a> does it go that there's a warrant drawn from the high school and that goes to pay off the payroll?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=969.844s">I</a> guess what I'm trying to understand is, because I've worked with a little data myself, so I'm trying to understand why is it difficult to pull out the department? <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=977.549s">Because</a> I would imagine that these numbers must correspond to a different data set that you have, right?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1023.731s">Yeah,</a> I mean, I understand that there must be many different data frames, but what I'm trying to understand is why is it, I still, maybe it's just because my head's so thick here, so maybe you could just go through it with me a couple of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1035.412s">So</a> if, and I'm not saying that this is the case, but let's say there's Dr., I don't know, Ghostface. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1041.996s">How</a> do, you know, someone who just ended up in the payroll system. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1044.918s">You</a> hear about stories about this every so often. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1046.919s">You</a> read the news that there's some mystery person that's been drawing payroll for years and years and years, even though they're not on the system anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1053.823s">That</a> couldn't happen to us, right?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1063.85s">How</a> do you know they're active?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1134.731s">We</a> approve this every week, so I just want to make sure I'm crystal clear on the process.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1192.959s">I</a> understand that people might have different deductions, and that changes the gross wages. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1199.243s">I</a> completely understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1200.924s">What</a> I'm having trouble understanding.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1206.607s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1206.987s">Excuse</a> me. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1207.427s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1208.188s">So</a> what I'm trying to understand is, so there's data coming to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1212.283s">then</a> you filter that data and make this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1214.244s">So</a> there's no column about where that person works or what that person's title or role is in the company?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1230.529s">What</a> are the data frames? <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1232.03s">I</a> mean, I'm trying to understand.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1264.558s">My</a> challenge here is it seems that there must be some sort of data frame of some sort, whether it's something like some SQL database or some database where this employee has all the facts about that employee are in a column on some sort of database.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1290.494s">What's</a> the format of the database?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1311.97s">With</a> all due respect, so the only assurance that we have that we don't have some sort of ghost member on the payroll is that the program tells us so?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1349.691s">I</a> have no question. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1350.872s">I</a> want to make clear to everyone, I'm not implying that I think that there's any malfeasance. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1356.175s">I</a> don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1356.695s">What</a> I'm trying to understand is the difficulty in drawing the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1360.878s">Because</a> for me, I would, whatever data frame you're working on, you should be able to draw these columns. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1368.586s">and</a> the columns come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1370.047s">Like,</a> that's all the database experience I've ever had.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1390.699s">So</a> they would just have multiple entries on the column. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1394.341s">See,</a> that seems to be the solution to the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1396.339s">If</a> you had someone who works at both the Andrews and the Roberts, they would just have a comma in between the two places.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1408.47s">Well,</a> I mean, we have a fiduciary responsibility to the voters of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1413.074s">I</a> mean, that's our job, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1414.747s">I</a> mean, that's what we vote on, is to make sure that these people vote here. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1419.331s">The</a> idea is that we have a report, but you're missing a key actual value on this data frame, which is to know where this person works in our system. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1430.14s">I</a> have, you know, there are many, many names here, and I'm sure they all work hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1433.743s">I'm</a> not, I wanna make absolutely clear, I'm not implying anything, but on the same token, <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1440.257s">I</a> mean, there's a crucial, I mean, why not just, why have the employee number or even the name?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1646.461s">With</a> all due respect to your point, which I understand where you're coming from, we don't have to take the entire population and test it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1652.823s">We</a> would test a sample. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1654.723s">So</a> we could take 30 people from this list, and I could double check it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1659.484s">That</a> would give me a reasonable set of understanding, well, I picked 30 names at random off this list. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1665.705s">All</a> these people work here. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1666.725s">That</a> would give me much more confidence. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1668.605s">Because</a> right now, there's no way for me to find any of these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1674.088s">And</a> that, but if I knew that, for example, let's say Michael Ruggiero, I don't want to name any names off the list, but let's say Michael Ruggiero, he works, he's a math teacher at the Roberts, that I would say, he's one of the names that I randomly drew from this page. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1688.274s">I</a> can check it if all 30 go through.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1693.056s">Like,</a> I don't have to test an entire population to get some information about that population, man.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1701.44s">I'm</a> all set.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2712.649s">Thank</a> you very much for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2714.823s">I</a> had a question about the vaping that you have on Thursday, February 7th. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2721.95s">How</a> is this event being advertised to parents?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2882.709s">Do</a> you know, Madam Mayor, do you know for the Education Promise Act, do you know the house number?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2890.51s">Thank</a> you so much.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3241.798s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3242.038s">Mr.</a> Ruggiero. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3242.659s">Mayor</a> Burkett, but also Madam Superintendent, it would be interesting to know how many parents or families have been affected by the government shutdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3249.901s">I</a> mean, I've been hearing that there have been a lot of reports, sort of, no one affected by me directly, but sort of secondhand information. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3258.304s">And</a> it'd be interesting to know if we could do more, either through Priscilla's Pantry, if we could figure something out.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4009.199s">I'm</a> sorry to keep giving you little corrections or suggestions to the board.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4015.304s">This</a> is on the second page under section one. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4019.707s">Is</a> it possible you could just include the exact URL that they need to download it so they could just click on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4026.372s">It</a> says medfordpublicschools.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4027.873s">Could</a> you just do the black slash? <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4029.654s">Because</a> our website can be a little difficult, especially for someone who has limited English skills. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4037.812s">More</a> detailed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4040.234s">Such</a> as myself, perhaps. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4041.815s">And</a> with that, I'd like to recommend that we put this online. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4045.458s">I</a> motion to approve.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4930.348s">And</a> maybe this will be covered in the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4932.749s">I</a> didn't see it here on the slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4934.89s">Could</a> you give us like the top five languages spoken by percent, is that?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4954.073s">Can</a> you give us a sense of how many students speak Arabic?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4960.135s">The</a> reason why I ask is for the prior mentioned kindergarten affair might be if we have a large percentage of Arabic speakers it might be useful to have translators for them available as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4971.057s">It's</a> possible we could find someone in the community that would be willing to volunteer.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4978.728s">For</a> kindergarten. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4979.368s">This</a> is not your, this is the prior presentation.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4983.029s">Do</a> we know if we have many Arabic-speaking kindergarten students or first grade students?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5000.614s">Could</a> you find that information out for us next time? <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5002.295s">Because</a> it would be interesting for me.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5488.115s">I've</a> only been looking at the English.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5695.229s">These</a> statistics are really concerning to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5697.25s">These</a> aren't unique to Medford, of course.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5705.295s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5705.656s">We're</a> looking at an epidemic of obesity in this country, which have, as everyone here I'm sure knows, has long-lasting health effects. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5713.24s">So</a> I'd like to suggest to the committee that we create a community of the whole when possible, perhaps whenever you think we could put together something to see how we could tackle this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5725.248s">Perhaps</a> we could welcome in some experts in childhood obesity to speak with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5732.175s">Because</a> there have to be some schools in America that are beginning to figure this problem out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5740.062s">We</a> can't do nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5742.745s">For</a> children to have these issues going forward, they might have health issues the rest of their life.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5770.558s">Yeah,</a> I want to clarify. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5771.318s">I</a> didn't mean to imply that you're not doing anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5773.859s">That</a> was the wrong idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5775.319s">This</a> statistic is deeply frustrating to me, because I know how this can affect children as a prior educator myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5781.66s">And</a> I also know the health outcomes that children with this condition, once those fat cells are in there, they have to fight them their whole life. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5791.042s">So</a> I really hope that we could do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5793.422s">I'm</a> looking for a second on the motion, if possible.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5799.458s">Just</a> to repeat the motion, the motion is to have a committee of the whole to address what policies we can put in place to tackle the obesity epidemic in our district.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5830.941s">I</a> don't think we have a nutrition subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5832.902s">The</a> curriculum would be the closest I can think of. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5834.942s">But</a> I think it would be best served if we were all there to talk about this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5838.604s">Because</a> we're looking at almost 300 kids that are either overweight or obese. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5844.025s">And</a> the obesity rates, we're looking at like 250 kids here. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5847.446s">I</a> mean, that's just my back of the envelope calculation. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5849.627s">And</a> that's a scary statistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5854.48s">The</a> health outcomes of these children are severe. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5857.063s">And</a> whatever kind of solutions we have to think of outside of the box, welcome in other committees that maybe have some ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5865.013s">I</a> really hope that we as a committee can at least begin to think outside the box on this one, because America is, we're having trouble.<h2><a href="../2019-01-09_CKGzHQJRVWc/2019-01-09_CKGzHQJRVWc.html">Medford School Committee meeting January 7, 2019</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2352.76s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2355.502s">Just</a> a question on the chain of command here. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2358.967s">this</a> new person will be reporting directly to you and will act independently. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2364.41s">So</a> what will the sort of relationship be between this person and the superintendent?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4833.685s">One</a> of the interesting factors I would like to discuss more about is vaping of cannabis oils. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4839.346s">So</a> do we have a sense of that increase? <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4842.067s">Because</a> it seems to me that's even a bigger problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4845.748s">Or</a> do you think it's of the same magnitude?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4914.256s">Do</a> we have a sense of how the rate has been increasing?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4943.359s">So</a> there's no sense?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=7285.686s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=7286.647s">Seeing</a> that these products are all illegal, do we have any sense of where kids are getting them from or how the distribution networks are happening in the high schools?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=7549.753s">So</a> do you think that it's simply the case where kids are just going into community stores, or is it just some kids have access and they're buying a bunch of it and then distributing it?

 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3496.933s">Mr.</a> Ruggiero. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3499.276s">We</a> spent a lot of time thinking about the idea of consequences and what the consequences are. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3503.28s">And</a> this is something we debated back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3505.673s">According</a> to Robert's Rules of Order, we have the authority now, whether we sign the document or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3511.015s">And</a> what is activity on becoming a member is actually a subjective element. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3517.878s">The</a> idea, though, is censure has, you are ultimately responsible to the members of Medford, and the citizens of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3528.062s">So</a> what you say is not, while we can censor you, it's what your authority is to the people of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3535.207s">So,</a> I mean, the idea, we wanted to add some element that we debated this idea back and forth quite a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3543.31s">Ultimately,</a> we came down on the idea that there should be some sort of provision for a member that we felt acts in violation with the things that we're signing. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3552.793s">Otherwise,</a> it's just a piece of paper.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3661.995s">Mrs.</a> DeVantage, yes.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3692.635s">safety</a> involvement and volunteering, but that's something we're still doing some more research on. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3697.397s">There</a> are three papers that we would like to have considered in the entire meeting, so I'll just go through the first of them right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3705.401s">The</a> first item that was referred to us many months ago was about digital documents being posted online. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3712.145s">Currently,</a> many parents have asked me to post items personally, but we as a committee felt it would be best if we had a unified policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3722.109s">So,</a> originally we wanted to do a number of research, which we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3726.692s">First,</a> we spoke with Dorothy Presser. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3728.893s">She's</a> our representative for the Massachusetts Association of School Committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3733.835s">She</a> has no official position. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3736.316s">There's</a> no official guidance on digital documents being posted online. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3741.279s">However,</a> she hasn't heard any negative feedback from the communities that do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3746.561s">They</a> also don't track it, but she said probably a sizable minority, maybe 40%, maybe 30% of communities do post online. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3756.912s">So</a> after that, I called a number of different school committees and mostly superintendent's offices to see their position and see <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3766.462s">what</a> effect it had in their community posting these documents online. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3771.943s">There</a> were basically four major areas that I asked them. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3776.064s">First,</a> I asked them to describe their posting process. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3778.825s">All</a> of the communities I had a chance to talk to had different processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3783.205s">Second,</a> I asked, did it help or hurt the community? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3786.226s">And</a> what problems have you had in the implementation? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3789.127s">Thirdly,</a> I asked, what system did you use to post? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3792.407s">And</a> finally, I asked, did they have any unforeseen problems that arose? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3797.688s">In</a> short, all the communities I spoke to felt very positively about posting documents online. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3803.83s">None</a> reported any significant problems from people using documents in a way that was not becoming or productive. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3814.312s">First,</a> I spoke with some people at Melrose. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3818.093s">I</a> spoke to Diane Hogan. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3819.333s">She's</a> the assistant to the superintendent there. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3821.874s">Overall,</a> she believed that they had a positive experience of posting packets online. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3826.736s">Their</a> community posted packets 72 hours in advance, and they use a program called Grayness, which is used by the entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3838.939s">Diane,</a> or Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3839.739s">Hogan,</a> believed it helped the community in real time. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3842.488s">And</a> they've been doing it since 2012. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3843.589s">They</a> also felt that there's a tendency for rumors to sort of spread through a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3850.695s">But</a> with the digital documents there, she felt that those kind of rumors were stymied. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3856.981s">I</a> left a message with the people at Danvers, but they weren't able to get back to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3860.164s">And</a> I also called a couple of other districts and weren't able to get back to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3865.767s">But</a> the people at Redding, whose name, the last name of this lady I unfortunately forgot to write down, her name was Linda. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3871.853s">She</a> was also an executive assistant. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3874.596s">She</a> believed that they had a very positive experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3877.298s">They</a> posted 48 hours in advance of meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3881.282s">And</a> they used PDFs. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3882.743s">So</a> they don't, they do not pay for any expensive system. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3885.726s">They</a> just post PDFs online. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3888.813s">Franklin</a> Public Schools, I spoke to Denise Miller. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3892.337s">They've</a> had also a very positive experience with posting. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3895.601s">They</a> felt like there were no problems with doing anything online. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3900.187s">What</a> they did was a system, actually I'm going to recommend that we do, they send a link <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3904.633s">to</a> school committee members first. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3907.056s">School</a> committee members have a few hours to review the materials in advance, and then the link is sent to the community at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3915.704s">They</a> don't send presentations or superintendent notes beforehand, and they also use just PDFs. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3922.15s">Finally,</a> I spoke to the people at Lexington. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3925.072s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3925.392s">Calvino</a> is the executive assistant there. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3927.974s">She</a> was the most enthusiastic about posting documents online in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3932.676s">She</a> felt that it was very helpful to members of the community, and she would have actually parents call her back if they were spelling errors or typos online, so that was something that they had. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3942.522s">She</a> believes lots of parents use the documents and look forward to the packets to make sure that when they come to school committee meetings, they're prepared in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3951.947s">She</a> did have or their community had a little problem with posting PDFs on a timetable that the community understood. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3960.132s">So</a> they just recommend that maybe we have a trial period first to make sure that all the wrinkles are ironed out and yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3968.594s">So</a> there's no confusion about when things are posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3972.577s">So</a> our committee unanimously voted to do a similar program as they do in Franklin. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3980.782s">We</a> would like there to be a link sent to all school committee members at 12 noon to all school committee members, and then a link sent to the community at large at 4 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3992.898s">These</a> links would be in our entire packets, but what is confidential or materials that need to be presented and put in context?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4004.106s">No,</a> we haven't voted on the minutes yet.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4007.808s">No,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4009.409s">We</a> voted to send it to school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4011.891s">I</a> wasn't sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4012.391s">Can</a> we send?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4021.789s">Yeah,</a> we haven't voted on those minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4023.952s">But</a> I believe at this point we've done a good amount of research on this issue and we can move this forward.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4038.181s">So</a> you need the minutes for this meeting.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4176.22s">Well,</a> absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4176.94s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4177.08s">I'm</a> just, I'm a little confused on the logistics of this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4180.381s">So</a> the minutes of the meeting haven't been posted because we haven't voted on our last meeting yet.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4189.243s">We</a> did vote at the end of our meeting to send these, to send the digital documents meeting forward to the whole committee.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4196.184s">So</a> there's two items I would like to be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4199.114s">that</a> we vote for the meet and greet, and two, also, that we start posting digital documents online, which we've cleared with the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4206.936s">That</a> shouldn't be a problem to do.<h2><a href="../2018-12-05_n-uYCOJ8CVc/2018-12-05_n-uYCOJ8CVc.html">Medford School Committee meeting December 3, 2018</a></h2>

 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3005.498s">Yeah,</a> this is a really great event. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3008.621s">I'm</a> just so proud, Marcie, for being selected. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3011.183s">I</a> was just curious, was there some sort of competition?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3043.482s">It</a> would be just so wonderful if you guys could put together a little YouTube video or something.

 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3538.673s">Yeah,</a> thank you for this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3539.974s">I</a> also really enjoyed the breakdowns. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3542.415s">I</a> was really curious, though, when I originally read this, about the ratio of special education students in pre-K. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3550.143s">It</a> seemed like that's a pretty big chunk of the population, or is that a normal? <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3554.907s">Once</a> again, the male to female ratio seemed a little different, or am I reading the report wrong?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3614.415s">Is</a> that mandated by the state or is that via funding issue or is that just our policy in general?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3665.14s">Great,</a> thank you so much.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4921.756s">I'm</a> all set.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4923.923s">Yeah,</a> I would also like to know participation rates in the different activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4927.445s">Just</a> so, obviously, if we have one chess kid and that kid costs a million dollars, like a crazy example. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4933.227s">But</a> it would tell me a lot more about the program and participation rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4936.609s">But</a> I do have other questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4939.951s">I</a> was curious about, on page six of nine, about the math teacher allocation. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4944.173s">In</a> particular, I was interested in the Andrews Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4947.474s">And</a> I noticed here that the budget there <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4951.772s">that</a> we've exceeded the budget significantly. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4953.773s">I</a> just want to know what the situation was there.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4981.175s">It</a> just seems like, once again, talking about parity at our middle schools, when you have this page six of nine, when you have one school getting almost $120,000 more from math teachers, that's... So, again, it's about replacement.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5016.176s">It</a> would just be nice to understand what's happening there. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5020.298s">And</a> this question is, I recognize you're very, very busy and you have lots going on, especially at this time of year. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5027.842s">But</a> I wanted to know, do we have a sense of different school districts? <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5032.103s">Is</a> that a report that would be easily found by you? <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5038.906s">Obviously,</a> I'm not asking you to cook it up yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5042.347s">But</a> is there some sort of database of different school systems that have breakdowns as fine?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5053.43s">And</a> for the closeouts and everything? <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5055.939s">It</a> would be really interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5057.06s">I</a> mean, I guess it's a question of I'll do the research myself then. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5059.602s">But</a> this report itself, when you created it, was this one program that generated all these numbers?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5071.672s">Is</a> it possible that you could create or email us the report when you create this as a machine-readable format? <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5078.257s">So</a> it would be a little easier for me if I do the district-by-district analysis.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5109.983s">Is</a> it a giant burden for you to send us this report as a machine-readable PDF? <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5114.767s">Is</a> that an easy thing where it's just Control-P and it's sent out?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5136.093s">Right,</a> but then I'll have to code something.

 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=1891.046s">Do</a> we have a sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=1891.926s">So</a> you have the overweight and obesity statistic together. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=1894.827s">Do</a> you have a sense of what the obesity statistic is for children in the fourth grade?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=1915.774s">I</a> would be also interested to know different grades as well.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=1949.653s">So</a> the fourth grade has a particular problem.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=1992.488s">I</a> mean, the health effects of childhood obesity are significant.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2000.417s">For</a> me, I think that this is a conversation I would like to have more of, if possible, especially thinking of solutions that we could do, whether it's a question of looking at our lunch program or looking at more activities for children, because these are some frightening statistics.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2020.17s">20%</a> of America's children are obese, not overweight, but obese.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2047.458s">Do</a> you think the lunch program in particular could be explored? <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2051.582s">Like</a> we offer pizza every day at the high school, right?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2057.687s">I</a> mean, I would personally, if we could, find time for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2060.13s">I</a> know we're having a busy, but if we could find time on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2062.832s">I'd</a> really like to consider this problem, because I think we have a serious problem.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2102.078s">complete</a> child, the statistics broken down. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2104.721s">By</a> grade? <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2105.421s">Yeah,</a> by grade, but not just overweight, but also by obesity. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2108.825s">And</a> if possible, I would like to really have a full conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2112.52s">Oh,</a> you don't do overweight?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2122.003s">Well,</a> I mean, that would at least be a start.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2126.804s">Yeah,</a> I just want to know how many are, because the differences between overweight can be a pound. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2132.106s">But</a> obese, that means you're walking into adulthood with a one in three chance of having type 2 diabetes, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2138.128s">I</a> mean, it's a serious problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2139.809s">That's</a> a lifelong condition.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3104.711s">Thank</a> you, Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3105.992s">Thank</a> you for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3107.853s">I</a> just recently finished William Dersowitch's book, Excellent Sheep. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3111.54s">and</a> it talks about this idea of the raising rates of anxiety and depression among children and students in America. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3117.985s">I</a> wanted to know, do we compile statistics about reported incidences of depression in our school system?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3158.661s">for</a> children of a certain socioeconomic class, they might not necessarily have access to. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3164.267s">I'm</a> just curious, like, when children come in and report a scenario or report suicidal thoughts, for example, is that information recorded?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3208.671s">That's</a> like a fourth of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3210.953s">No,</a> like an eighth of our students.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3233.403s">Sure.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3236.044s">Statistically,</a> it's 20%. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3237.824s">And</a> is that what we found with the surveys, where students self-reporting that statistic? <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3242.866s">On</a> the survey, do you say, I have suicidal thoughts, for example? <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3245.667s">Is</a> that on the survey?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3274.956s">And</a> do you have a sense of how that's changed over time, or is that number remaining consistent?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3287.663s">I</a> think it would be very helpful for me if we could look for a report, while we're doing the obesity report, if we could have sort of a health day. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3295.373s">It</a> would be interesting for me to see reports and statistics about obesity, statistics about mental health, and also statistics about drug use as well, because I would like to see sort of the many different comorbidities, I guess, of health in our system.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3314.708s">Oh,</a> okay, great.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3339.732s">Do</a> you have a sense if children are self-medicating? <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3342.055s">If</a> they're using alcohol, for example, to treat their depression?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3360.517s">To</a> the chair, Dr. Edward-Vincent, are these statistics provided to the state versus different school systems? <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3368.382s">It</a> would be interesting for me to know how Arlington is doing, how Medford's doing, how Somerville's doing, like our sister cities in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3375.947s">What</a> are the health factors of those districts? <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3379.73s">Would</a> they report to the state?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3413.7s">I</a> mean, it would be interesting for me to, maybe we could request that from the Department of Education. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3419.143s">Public</a> health. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3420.084s">Oh,</a> public health or education. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3421.425s">I'm</a> not sure where the data would be compiled. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3423.666s">But</a> it would be very interesting for me to know how we're doing, and especially in regards to <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3428.312s">Like</a> I said, other factors that maybe if we improved diet, we'd also help depression, help drug use as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3436.634s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=4063.621s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=4064.621s">Just</a> like everyone else, I've attended good PD days and terrible PD days. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=4068.543s">How</a> did we do last year?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=4092.147s">Yeah,</a> that's what I was curious about, the survey response.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=4137.558s">That's</a> fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=4138.198s">And</a> I wanted to know, how often does the PD committee meet the professional development committee?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=4156.025s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=4156.985s">And</a> so did you pick out these workshops yourself or did you work with the superintendent to find these workshops?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=4181.252s">Well,</a> thank you very much for putting it on.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5932.747s">Yet</a> when I decided to run for school committee, one main question motivated me. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5938.011s">Simply</a> stated, I wondered, with over 4,000 students and $58 million in assets, why are most school committee meetings so poorly attended by parents? <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5949.999s">Before</a> I ran, I feared that it is as they say on TV. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5953.902s">People</a> were simply disinterested and disengaged in local politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5959.356s">But</a> knocking on thousands of doors, a passion and brilliance drove me to continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5965.122s">After</a> a few months, an obvious answer arose. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5969.306s">It</a> was our timing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5971.408s">People</a> have amazing energy and ideas to help drive our schools forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5975.912s">But</a> 7 o'clock on a Monday is a challenging, if not almost impossible time for many parents to voice their opinions. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5984.82s">Dozens</a> of parents have voiced support for a biannual weekend meeting such as I have proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5992.504s">But</a> tonight's meeting time came into conflict with, and these are real responses I got from tonight, late night work schedules that just came up, the parent-teacher conference that are coming up, bedtimes, family dinner. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6005.591s">Thus,</a> I suggest we hold a meeting when parents can attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6010.535s">As</a> you can hear in the resolution, I suggest two meetings held on perhaps a Saturday afternoon every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6018.144s">I</a> propose we create an idea fair of sorts on important topics such as addressing our budget or energizing after school activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6027.703s">The</a> goals and themes of these meetings can be chosen by our committee and our superintendent to ensure that we are generating momentum to projects that we already have in the works. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6038.727s">But</a> I hope that we can really move forward real school committee meetings, where great ideas can begin to get some action. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6046.891s">Additionally,</a> I would like to invite Corey Check members of the PTO to help with child care, entertainment, and food during the event. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6054.554s">With</a> these amenities, <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6055.935s">busy</a> parents don't have to wrestle dinner or childcare for frisky kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6060.878s">Personally,</a> I would love to see these events catered by our new bistro. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6064.801s">But</a> most importantly, I would like volunteer groups and PTOs associated with our schools to advertise opportunities for people to contribute. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6073.647s">Clay</a> Shirky coined the phrase cognitive surplus to describe the untapped energy and talent people have available after work. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6082.533s">I</a> honestly believe <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6084.062s">that</a> the city of Medford contains hundreds of scientists that would love to open up and help out with STEM students. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6091.41s">Hundreds</a> of artists ready to inspire. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6093.693s">Dozens</a> of CEO dads and professor moms ready to open up their business and labs, if only asked at a time when they aren't at work or tucking in their kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6104.157s">Before</a> we open the floor, I want to acknowledge that I've left a lot of the details and dates of these meetings open to discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6110.098s">I</a> know that our superintendent has to work out the details, and I hope to work with her as we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6116.5s">Seeing</a> that we are almost up to Christmas, perhaps only one meeting this year is possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6123.282s">But</a> I'm really excited about this proposal, and I can assure you many, many parents feel like that this would be a great addition to our school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6131.204s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6145.264s">I've</a> done a little broad research. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6147.045s">I</a> know that some private schools have done it in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6149.788s">When</a> I was a teacher, private schools would hold a weekend open house backslash.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6208.725s">I</a> mean, this is something that we can leave open to debate as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6214.46s">But</a> is it possible for us to have an official meeting where we're not following Robert's rules and therefore making it a very not
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6312.937s">Some</a> of the rules are just have a recess and just have a listening session as well, where we're all present. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6318.161s">But</a> if we do deliberate, if we do make decisions, yes, we would have to reform the committee or after a recess period.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6405.964s">I</a> would like to suggest that we have a system, a way of thinking about it.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6412.128s">If</a> something goes wrong, and it's really bad, all the parents show up. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6416.031s">Wouldn't</a> it be great if the system was, let's actually work together on making something right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6420.334s">A</a> more proactive response in how we plan the policies of our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6429.13s">I</a> feel like parents have reached out to all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6432.353s">I'm</a> sure we all have solid problems that people have reached out that we've all done solutions.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6486.712s">Once</a> again, like I said, I don't think that the question is, oh, there's some terrible thing that we're just not doing, per se, like a slide that needs to be prepared. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6498.38s">I</a> think the issue is more inviting people that have a resource available that they might be able to provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6507.067s">And</a> by creating a time when they can actually attend, <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6510.179s">they</a> can actually begin to engage with the community and try to figure out how they can fit that resource into the needs of our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6518.625s">Are</a> you all set?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6776.443s">I</a> do an official survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6777.784s">This</a> is unscientific. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6778.905s">We</a> mis-explained it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6783.549s">Yeah,</a> there's always going to be issues on the weekend as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6786.571s">So</a> some parents, they get told that Monday we may not be able to go on Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6790.655s">But</a> I do believe that if we create an event atmosphere, we create like child care or a movie that we project, create something that's more fun as well.<h2><a href="../2018-12-03_FL68V2M-0Ng/2018-12-03_FL68V2M-0Ng.html">Medford School Committee meeting November 5, 2018</a></h2>

 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2610.587s">So</a> you're all full.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2720.841s">Yeah,</a> I just had a quick question about the statement here required to pass a criminal background check for the tour guide and the tour directors. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2730.675s">Do</a> you know anything about what type or how it's usually?

 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2741.659s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3650.199s">Yeah,</a> thank you for putting together this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3652.8s">I</a> had a question about the actual unexpected walk, bike, share table that you have here. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3658.541s">So</a> how is the expected calculated? <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3662.604s">This</a> is, it says that we have 47% for other members. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3668.468s">These</a> aren't the numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3669.689s">This</a> is on the GHG.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3729.579s">Can</a> you, when I read this through this report, I was looking for other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3735.264s">Can</a> you give us a sense of what a community like Melrose or Somerville or Arlington, what their participation rates would be?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3855.262s">The</a> line that I found most sort of interesting was the sequence that says if you live less than a mile from the school, the actual participation is 8%, but you're expecting about 30%. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3871.628s">Do</a> you see other communities making that 30%?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3875.249s">So</a> what do you think makes Medford unique in this regard? <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3880.733s">Where</a> are we lacking, I guess, because I would love to see, you know, I think it's a great thing for kids to be able to walk to school or bike to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3887.419s">So</a> how can we make that better?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3895.525s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3973.991s">Is</a> it possible you could give us these statistics broken down by school instead of having it through the whole district, as you do here, the actual and expected?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3985.2s">No,</a> I'm looking at the greenhouse gas admissions page and how your school compares and has actual and expected walk, bike, chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3993.81s">That</a> sequence right there?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4017.374s">Also,</a> once it's not, if you don't have the 50% participation rate, it doesn't necessarily get recorded.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4025.153s">It's</a> not as accurate, I see.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4306.871s">Oh,</a> I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4308.711s">Did</a> you want to speak something? <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4310.548s">I</a> just wanted to, I think this report is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4314.09s">I</a> think there is a huge potential, especially at that under one mile mark, to improve the participation in this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4321.234s">So</a> thank you so much for bringing all the hard work and bringing this program forward to us.<h2><a href="../2018-10-03_psVhVz9ZIEQ/2018-10-03_psVhVz9ZIEQ.html">Medford School Committee meeting October 1, 2018</a></h2>

 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=3097.715s">I</a> totally understand what you're saying.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5907.177s">Are</a> there reimbursement for children of special needs? <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5912.158s">Is</a> there a financial waiver for students of special needs?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5942.75s">So</a> the full $10,000 has been- Is the need higher than the number of students that we've provided for or around that figure?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5975.673s">Did</a> more people apply for the scholarship than received it?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5989.227s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5989.927s">Patterson,</a> may I ask you a question about financing? <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5992.148s">How</a> much would it cost for us to maybe provide a waiver for 15 more students to increase the number to 30? <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6000.05s">Another</a> 10,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6001.591s">Would</a> that be the waiver needed?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6041.104s">Is</a> it possible you could crunch those numbers for us as a report?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6069.526s">Let's</a> say, for example, we found $10,000 under the rug here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6074.399s">and</a> you reapplied that money, would we lose money from the state if we, let's say, provided a scholarship for 30 other students?

 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6089.812s">I'd</a> like to make a motion for us to ask for a report to see if you could report back to us what that number would be, because if <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6096.377s">If</a> there is a need greater, I mean, I know many parents that are struggling in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6101.04s">Some</a> of the parents work two jobs each. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6103.502s">I</a> mean, this program might be a huge boon for them and their family. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6107.504s">So</a> it would be interesting for me to know what it would take for us to make 15 more slots available. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6113.928s">If,</a> you know, someone provides all the information.

 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2733.72s">After</a> the last budget meeting, I was deeply disturbed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2738.347s">Not</a> by so much the presentation of the budget or anything that was contained in, but a fact I learned that I wasn't aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2743.931s">And</a> this would be the pupil transportation of homeless students and the amount of money that's spent to this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2750.856s">Obviously,</a> I have no troubles helping students that are homeless, making sure that they're a part of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2757.841s">But</a> when we spend so much on these students, that money could be better used <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2763.485s">to</a> house them. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2766.006s">The</a> fact that we're spending over $13,000 a year to move a child here from Medford to whatever community they come from where their parents might be living in a shelter is insane. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2779.792s">It</a> is the exact kind of bureaucratic insanity which prompted me to run for elected office. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2788.651s">So</a> that said, I would like to ask my colleagues that we refer this issue to City Solicitor Mark Brumley. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2794.453s">Now,</a> I understand that the state is supposed to reimburse us for this money, and they haven't. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2801.936s">But</a> we have a platform to advocate for these children, and by pressing this case as hard as possible, <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2809.65s">with</a> either our own attorney, Howard Greenspan, or City Solicitor Mark Rumley. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2814.612s">I</a> think would shed light on this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2817.554s">Like</a> I said, it's absolutely absurd that we spend this money to truck a child back and forth, rather than helping them house, helping them find housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2830.34s">And</a> I seriously would like to make a motion that we refer this issue to City Solicitor Mark Rumley.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2841.979s">Well,</a> we've been doing that.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2873.908s">It's</a> my understanding that the Supreme Court ruled that they have to reimburse us for this money. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2878.07s">Is</a> that correct or incorrect?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2890.924s">Well,</a> I think that we need to pursue this issue beyond simply just putting pressure on legislators. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2897.485s">I</a> really do.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2908.888s">So</a> the resolution I'd like to put forward.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2964.762s">Well,</a> they can put a ruling for... There is a ruling from the Supreme Court.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2973.035s">Yeah,</a> I would like to make a formal motion to have City Solicitor Mark Rumley and Howard Greenspan look at this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2980.348s">to</a> advise us how we should move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2983.81s">My</a> frustration is not in helping homeless children. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2986.872s">That</a> absolutely needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2988.572s">My</a> frustration is wasting money that could be better used housing these children. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2992.955s">And</a> I find it deeply frustrating.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3445.707s">beyond</a> the other points, the kindergarten aides and the capital budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3451.929s">I</a> am going to end up abstaining on this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3454.37s">I</a> have difficulty.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3461.713s">Well,</a> I- And this is not a capital budget.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3472.677s">I</a> understand it's not the capital budget, ma'am, but could you please <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3475.585s">I'm</a> asking just for a rough estimate.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3483.389s">On</a> the capital, so you have no idea.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3632.558s">I</a> mean, with all due respect to the superintendent, whose opinion I do value, my frustration is parents are very concerned and very frustrated about the state of some of our grounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3645.761s">And</a> I mean, so I guess it boils down to a question of trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3649.502s">And</a> I'm ultimately out. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3652.344s">I'll</a> give you the benefit of the doubt, Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3654.305s">I</a> mean, I think that's the best move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3657.567s">I've</a> mentioned all my reservations to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3659.268s">I</a> appreciate some of the items that were brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3662.17s">I</a> still can't understand why we can't hire a couple more part-time kindergarten aides. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3668.294s">I</a> don't understand the logic of that, but.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3678.861s">Right,</a> and, you know.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3682.927s">This</a> is my first year serving. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3685.509s">I've</a> noticed other members have maybe more frustrations than I, but I'll cut you some slack, I guess.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4048.097s">So</a> in mid-August, you mentioned that you would roughly have a timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4053.059s">There'll</a> be a committee of the whole meeting where we discuss the capital improvement plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4057.26s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4058.202s">I</a> just wanted to make sure.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4193.263s">I</a> just also want to thank the members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4196.927s">I</a> really appreciated not only everyone's heart, but also the opportunity to explore the issues with you, because we all have disagreements. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4204.954s">We</a> all have programs that we really love. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4208.233s">But</a> it was a really wonderful experience for me, and I really appreciated working with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4212.996s">So</a> I just want to, beyond all of the work that our finance department did, and all the work our superintendent, and I'm sure all the work that Dr. Edouard-Vincent put in as well, I just wanted everyone to know, I mean, we worked very long on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4227.403s">And</a> it really means a lot to me how hard people work. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4229.724s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4306.826s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4307.266s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4307.966s">Mayor</a> Burke, I also have another point that's not a part of the process, but something I'd like to see in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4314.273s">A</a> number of communities have worked with participatory budgeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4317.914s">where</a> a certain amount of money is set aside for the community to decide how it's used. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4322.816s">I</a> was thinking that .1% would work out to be about $60,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4327.238s">I</a> would like in the future to explore this idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4332.06s">I</a> don't know exactly when the right time is. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4335.182s">We</a> could put this as an agenda item so we could debate it or I'll make a motion right now to explore the idea or put it on the next time we have an agenda.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4347.837s">No,</a> I would like to see community budget and the school budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4352.619s">So</a> parents have a little bit more feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4354.519s">I</a> mean, yeah, I think that would help community participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4356.94s">And</a> in addition, parents sometimes have the best ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4360.462s">I've</a> learned a whole lot from the people that have called me.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4368.205s">I</a> just want to get a sense of when we'll do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4369.685s">I'll</a> ask to put that on the agenda when we have the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4372.146s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4372.386s">Very</a> good.<h2><a href="../2018-05-23_OW5zlwQpW0s/2018-05-23_OW5zlwQpW0s.html">Medford School Committee Meeting May 21, 2018</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=63.918s">So</a> I'm just trying to find the page number here. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=67.78s">It's</a> from the warrant, 18-0-1-3-8. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=70.822s">This</a> is the minimum regional high school tuition out of state, out of, sorry, district tuition expenses.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=79.426s">Eight</a> of 11, excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=81.567s">It's</a> fourth from the bottom. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=84.409s">I</a> just wanted to know, what are the two programs that most of the students are enrolled in?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=102.722s">It's</a> the Minuteman Regional High School and Vocational High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=105.904s">Oh,</a> Minuteman.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=133.957s">Do</a> you know of this program, what is the one that most of the students are enrolled in? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=139.179s">Plumbing.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=139.459s">Is</a> it plumbing? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=140.0s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=140.58s">Plumbing</a> still?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=156.809s">How</a> many kids do we have currently in the program?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=170.978s">Could</a> you just give me a breakdown of the program when you have time? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=173.06s">Certainly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=173.72s">Can</a> you give me a breakdown of what programs are enrolled in? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=175.381s">Absolutely,</a> ma'am. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=176.422s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1279.987s">So</a> we had the reddismith and the landscaper and I, we walked the area and sort of viewed and we also did some soil tests. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1289.192s">For</a> the high bush blueberries, the soil isn't quite acidic enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1292.915s">If</a> possible, I'm happy to donate the plastic mulch, the thyme, and also the sulfur. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1297.758s">But</a> if possible, I'd like to start preparing the soil so we can get the pH. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1302.46s">Right</a> now the pH is around six, which is <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1305.685s">It's</a> way too high for blueberries, so we have to drop that around to about 4.5 or 5. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1310.007s">So</a> I'm happy to donate all the preparations for blueberries, but these other plants that were chosen, I looked them up and I talked to some horticultural friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1317.931s">These</a> are all really great plants that they've chosen. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1320.653s">We</a> just have to touch up a little bit with the blueberries.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1325.836s">Well,</a> it depends if the club would like to plant this September. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1331.039s">There's</a> a couple of options that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1332.639s">It</a> would be best to rototill the area for the blueberries. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1335.9s">I</a> already have about 30 plants and containers, and I have all the plastic mulch. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1340.541s">So</a> what I would recommend would be to rototill the area, spread some sulfur, and then give it a couple of months, and then we can apply some, I have prepared some acidic wood chips, so that'll help as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1357.056s">And</a> I would prefer to get that done as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1359.657s">It'll</a> take me probably about a couple of days, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1362.238s">I</a> just need to rototill it, lay down the plastic mulch. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1365.82s">We</a> have to measure it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1366.66s">I</a> also can, I'll send down all the drip irrigation.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1415.674s">The</a> way I handle this on my farm is we have an electric fence. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1420.022s">I'm</a> happy to, once again, I'll donate the T-poles and the wiring, and I'll set it up for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1426.725s">My</a> fence has 7,000 volts that run through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1428.966s">Obviously</a> it won't hurt anyone, but it could be a great prank for kids to mess around with, so we'll have to talk with the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1435.209s">If</a> you want me to install it, we definitely need to shut it down during school hours, and we'll have to talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1441.532s">But</a> it's possible we could turn it on once school is not in session, and then I could put it on a timer. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1447.495s">and</a> then we can shut it off once it's on eight o'clock and deer won't bother you.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1463.459s">We</a> could actually choose a lower voltage. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1465.499s">I</a> have a higher voltage on my farm because I want the deers to get shocked. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1468.84s">But</a> if we have people around, we can have a lower voltage. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1473.041s">It's</a> basically like someone, a little bee sting. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1477.615s">Like</a> someone hits you kind of hard with a pencil eraser is what it feels like. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1481.676s">It</a> doesn't leave any permanent damage. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1483.377s">It's</a> humane to the animals as well.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1489.739s">Yeah,</a> we'd have to figure out. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1491.62s">If</a> you want, I'll be happy to lay down the fence.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1495.021s">Or</a> we'll hold off. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1496.102s">That's</a> fine too.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1499.163s">No,</a> I understand.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1559.973s">I</a> just wanna make sure it's in the committee.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2086.985s">I</a> just want to comment how awesome that little bag is. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2088.966s">Thank</a> you so much for putting that together as a father who's about to have a kid go into kindergarten. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2093.85s">It's</a> a pretty frightening time. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2094.791s">So</a> I think that makes a lot of people a little more nervous. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2096.733s">It</a> is a scary.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2098.674s">Yeah,</a> I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2100.276s">Or</a> so I've heard.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2121.507s">Do</a> you know, have you heard much interest expressed in the community about starting a pre-K program that's also available for everyone?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2153.374s">Do</a> we have a sense of what the cost of that kind of program would be in the community?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2158.598s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2158.898s">Could</a> we ask that as a report from the superintendent that we could ask to see how much a universal 3K program would cost Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2165.383s">I</a> know there's a cost associated, but it'd be interesting to at least know the figures. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2170.026s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3038.306s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3040.435s">Yeah,</a> thank you so much for this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3042.277s">First</a> off, I'm just educational and a huge fan of after-school tutoring programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3047.482s">I</a> know for my own students, I feel like, you know, during class, I could just sort of run them in circles sometimes, but when I was one-on-one with them, that's when the learning really happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3057.331s">But</a> to that point, I noticed, you know, in your report, as you mentioned, you know, the ratio of students to teachers, probably not ideal. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3065.934s">Do</a> you think that if we added two more teachers to the program, that would have really solved the problem? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3070.398s">Or</a> do you think, how many teachers would you want it ideally?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3097.625s">Cool.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3097.985s">Please</a> let me know. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3099.126s">And</a> so if you ever need help in that way, I'm always happy to find one or two days a week to help you out. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3105.59s">Well,</a> it's good. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3106.21s">I</a> need the teaching hours for my license anyway to keep it good. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3109.838s">My</a> second point is, can you just give me a sense of what percentage, I know maybe you don't have the numbers handy right now, but of the 68 students that participated in the program, how many used the bus? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3121.629s">Just</a> ballpark.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3144.025s">The</a> next question I have for you is, do you know why all these students were participating? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3148.428s">Has</a> there been any conversation with the parents? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3150.149s">Is</a> it just that their parents want them to have more math time? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3153.491s">The</a> students are hungry for more math time? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3155.572s">Or</a> is it they saw their MCAS scores and it was like, let's just put out fires?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3184.46s">I</a> mean, in the future, I think that these type of, and I would like to sort of make this point to my colleagues as well, I think that for our school district to be one of the best in Massachusetts, this is the type of program we're gonna have to have district-wide. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3197.525s">Because</a> I've seen how effective they can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3200.122s">I</a> think that's a really good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3218.035s">a</a> district-wide program if we can, and sort of use Columbus as a pilot, learn what we can from it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3223.198s">So</a> thank you so much for all this hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3224.739s">I'm</a> really very excited about moving forward.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3233.323s">As</a> Member DiVendetto mentioned, unfortunately, this program came about sort of in an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3239.166s">We</a> had to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3240.007s">But</a> I think that now that the fire is out, there's a lot that we can learn moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3245.03s">So</a> thank you so much.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3793.504s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3796.73s">I</a> think it's really important that we design this program to touch both students that are struggling and students that are excelling. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3808.992s">What</a> I found personally, there's a really great program called the AMC8s. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3813.514s">Currently</a> I'm talking with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3815.254s">Carolyn</a> Joy about this idea, maybe we could add this to the curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3819.036s">They're</a> really wonderful because AMC, the American Math Competition, and they're designed for eighth graders. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3826.099s">When</a> I taught them to seventh and eighth graders, the problems themselves aren't just like, you know, where's the formula, chunk the formula, and you're done. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3833.081s">They</a> actually involve a lot of creativity. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3835.242s">And</a> they feel a lot more like undergraduate mathematics, as it should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3839.544s">So</a> the problems are very engaging to students. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3841.485s">Sometimes</a> it could just be the type of thing where you print out a big packet of problems to students, hand them to them, <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3848.297s">help</a> out the kids that are, you know, struggling a bit, and then check in with your students that are really accelerating. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3855.882s">I</a> think that, I mean, from my own educational experience, I really saw a huge impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3860.544s">Because,</a> you know, math can be, you know, it's taught and this isn't anyone's fault, obviously, but when you're teaching to a test, <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3867.048s">Math</a> can seem soulless, but the AMC 8s, you really feel the creativity and the beauty of mathematics, which is something we really should have. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3877.539s">Students</a> really should touch that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3879.521s">So</a> I would just, while I understand the cost, and I certainly appreciate it, <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3883.98s">Sometimes,</a> you know, kids that are accelerating really can kind of cruise a little bit, while teachers help the ones that are struggling, give some challenging, more advanced problems to those students, so they can get a taste of what math really feels like. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3897.935s">Because,</a> you know, it's a beautiful subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3899.977s">So</a> I hope we can design this program, and I hope we can pilot this program for the whole district.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4725.145s">Yeah,</a> I had a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4726.607s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4727.327s">Do</a> you know if there's interest in the student body in other languages, other than the Romance languages?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6250.063s">So</a> of this A team and B team, it's not simply that we can put the B team at the Andrews and the A teams at the McGlynn.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6325.198s">To</a> just transfer them? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6326.68s">Like</a> once they're, let's say they get to, you have a newcomer student, he's a really quick learner, he moves up to level four. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6333.107s">Couldn't</a> we just move him to the other school?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6412.961s">So</a> I guess my concern would be when you have a large concentration <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6417.833s">of</a> EL students at one school, then you also have EL parents also at that same school. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6424.298s">It</a> creates an environment where you might have one program just happens to be wealthier because of the sociodynamics versus the other program. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6434.066s">I</a> mean, I think that we have to recognize as a board that there aren't necessarily perfect solutions, but do we have a sense of how many students are in the A team versus the B team?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6451.77s">If</a> you had to just give me a rough estimate, I'd try to put you on the spot.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6978.064s">Just</a> one of the options that have been floated with some of the parents that have talked to me about this issue is this idea of creating a language magnet school. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6986.495s">at</a> the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6987.816s">So</a> it would be the reason why people want to go there is that they actually maybe has a full bilingual option. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6994.498s">So</a> every kid that goes through the McGlynn gets both, I don't know, whichever of the EL students that you have the most of, and that language. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7004.601s">Could</a> you give me, I mean, I know that I'm asking you to do a lot of ballparking, but is such a program possible? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7010.283s">Is</a> that an option that's on our table?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7042.995s">Are</a> there any other magnet schools in the area that do either Haitian Creole or Portuguese?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7069.183s">Brockton.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7071.219s">So</a> if we did a bilingual Portuguese magnet school, we'd be the only one in the state that has that program, is that correct?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7088.035s">Could</a> you give us a sense of what it would take to actually architect <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7090.527s">like</a> bill for that type of program?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7137.676s">So</a> just one last point. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7140.256s">So</a> if we did a bilingual Haitian Creole program, every teacher that's in there now, we'd have to find a new home for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7148.148s">And</a> we'd have to make sure that, or at least they'd find a way to get certified in Haitian Creole.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8125.325s">Yeah,</a> just two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8127.166s">The</a> first is on subsection four, where you talk about provisions for quality control. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8132.258s">Before</a> I, I just, I really do support the idea of doing partnership programs with local universities. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8138.021s">I</a> really commend the administration for working on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8140.283s">I</a> know you guys have been cooking this up since like December. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8143.285s">But</a> could you just outline what are the provisions for quality control? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8147.347s">Because</a> we're allowing them to hire the contractors, how do we really know that they won't shaft us?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8178.347s">And</a> sort of just to branch off Paul's concern, which is my concern as well, I just want to understand, so prevailing wages, how do we know that let's say they find some company, they say, oh, they're prevailing wages, don't worry about it.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8194.83s">All</a> that will be verified and we'll make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8196.97s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8197.35s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8197.87s">Once</a> again, I just really appreciate all the work you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8199.231s">No,</a> no, it's good that you're asking because I want you to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8201.191s">I</a> just want to make sure that we're all on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8203.391s">There's</a> no disasters. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8204.852s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9316.763s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9318.524s">I</a> mean, I know the administration is working very hard to deal with this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9322.106s">I</a> hate to funnel Cassandra, but this is a very frustrating report to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9326.033s">I</a> think we all kind of hoped it would go away, but here we are now at the last minute with no options of really solving it other than take them all from Brooks, which means that 33% of one out of every three kids that applied to go to the Andrews might get sent to the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9343.661s">That's</a> what it means, one out of every three. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9345.622s">Or</a> we take 11% out of the general population and we say to the 16 kids that go to McGlynn Elementary that they're just <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9354.44s">you</a> know, even though that they want to go to Andrews, you know, they went to the McGlynn, they kind of wanted to do something new, you know, we're saying you also have to handle that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9362.866s">So</a> this is a very frustrating report to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9365.407s">What's</a> most frustrating about this whole point is sort of this false choice that's being laid out in front of us that, oh, you can choose, but they're equal. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9376.095s">Like,</a> then why are you choosing, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9378.296s">If</a> these schools are equivalent, they're truly equivalent, <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9382.065s">And</a> then why choose? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9383.606s">Okay,</a> we have more room for ELL students at one school, I understand that, but it's just everyone's randomly drawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9392.133s">Or</a> there's a reason to choose one school. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9394.295s">Maybe</a> having, I love the idea of having a Haitian Creole magnet school in Medford, make us unique in Massachusetts, but that's a huge investment of time and energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9405.204s">Maybe</a> we could do a math magnet. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9406.905s">That</a> might be easier to draw our STEM magnet. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9409.976s">might</a> be easier to create. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9411.117s">One</a> school has more of a STEM focus, another school has more of a liberal arts focus. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9415.599s">These</a> are choices that we could have made, and now here we are at the 11th hour, and those choices are not in front of us anymore.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9473.469s">That's</a> our choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9474.97s">That's</a> our choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9475.53s">I</a> understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9476.491s">I'm</a> not trying to take someone to the woodshed here, and that's not my intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9480.032s">I</a> think what's frustrating to me about this report is I think it was kind of obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9485.295s">We</a> all kind of saw it coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9486.295s">We</a> just hoped it wouldn't be here at the 11th hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9489.617s">What</a> I would like to suggest is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9491.618s">I</a> mean, no matter what we decide, it's going to cause a little bit of trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9497.157s">But</a> it seems like if we expect that every school sort of has a reasonable distribution, it seems only fair to me that the Brooks School would be, you know, we say 17 or 20 kids have to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9510.289s">And</a> that just, you know, maybe that seems, you know, when we think of like what is fair for the community, is it fair for the entire community to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9520.442s">Oh,</a> you know, you're at the McGlynn Elementary. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9523.202s">There's</a> 16 kids there. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9524.943s">You</a> know, these are people that, friends that want to be together. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9528.423s">They</a> also should share, even though their school doesn't have this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9532.524s">So</a> in the future, I would really like to start considering more seriously the idea that there is a choice to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9538.825s">Right</a> now, there isn't, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9541.105s">We're</a> saying they're equal, they're both great. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9543.526s">Then</a> it's a false choice.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9578.21s">I</a> am in strong support of a weighted average option. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9581.953s">That</a> might be another way to play it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9583.915s">I</a> think that it seems only fair that we expect every school to basically feed into one. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9588.158s">And</a> unfortunately, that means one school will have more of a percentage of kids broken up.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10039.434s">I</a> mean, is it possible that we could only have a chance of 17 or is the number 20 a hard one?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10460.035s">Yeah,</a> just two points. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10460.995s">I</a> mean, first, I just want to address the community at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10463.736s">Obviously,</a> this is not a choice anyone here wants to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10466.378s">Everyone</a> wants everyone to get what they want or, you know, what their kids, but just talking about sort of the choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10473.521s">So</a> we're going to have to do a lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10474.782s">We're</a> basically forced into this choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10476.302s">The</a> question is, what is most fair and what is best? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10479.504s">So</a> I think we can all kind of agree <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10482.315s">that</a> what's most fair is sending kids from the school that is only sending 9% of their students. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10488.72s">What's</a> best also, though, if we're trying to prevent friends from being broken up, that's the best way to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10495.866s">Have</a> one school that's not sending their kids actually make, because the probability, if you have three buddies, of two of them getting selected, so at least you have Tom, you might not have Bob, but at least you have Tom with you, is much, much better. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10512.295s">But</a> if we have a system where 11% of every school is dropped off, we're going to be breaking up friendships. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10520.241s">And</a> the likelihood is they're not going to have cohorts with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10524.604s">So</a> I think that we're looking at, we're surveying what's not only best and fairest, but what is best for the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10532.069s">And</a> I really do believe that this plan of Paul's, which is something we're kind of cooking up with two minds while he's working in parallel, I guess is the phrase. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10541.145s">I</a> feel like this is the best way forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10544.106s">It's</a> best for the students, and it's fairest.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10576.839s">May</a> I make a friendly amendment to that?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10580.4s">Is</a> it possible, seeing that we only need 17 students, would be acceptable?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10618.019s">Well,</a> let's ask the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10619.26s">We</a> have the experts right before us.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10661.439s">We</a> have a parent that would like to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10664.6s">Your</a> name and address, please.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11130.675s">I'm</a> done. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11132.575s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11133.536s">One</a> last point in support of this idea of Mr. Tucci going down. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11136.756s">I</a> think it's important for the community that for, you know, we don't want kids to just be forced at the last minute with no recall. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11144.978s">We</a> want parents to have as many options as they can and many possibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11149.019s">And</a> if we can get, you know, 10 people <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11152.012s">to</a> move over, that's only five that we have to select from the rest of the cohort. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11156.015s">So</a> I really do support this idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11158.077s">I</a> think either we're paying now or we're paying later, because there's going to be a certain, there's going to be feelings about this, especially when we're taking such a large percentage.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11637.058s">Overall,</a> I definitely support the spirit. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11638.659s">I</a> mean, I leave my cell phone in the car for this very reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11641.02s">You</a> know, I have my computer here, but I'm not receiving texts to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11645.083s">But</a> I think it's important for us to recognize as a group <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11648.239s">that</a> we live in an age where people that do have serious disabilities can still participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11653.762s">And</a> it would be great if we create an environment for that to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11657.484s">I</a> agree that we should have all of our personal, like, you know, someone shouldn't be sending member Ruggiero a message or member Paul a message, because that's kind of, it's kind of working beyond the spirit of open meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11670.371s">But</a> it would be nice if we had a number. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11673.066s">or</a> a Twitter feed or something where maybe the chair could make, you know, Martin, who has a serious disability, wasn't able to come today, but he had a really great suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11686.671s">Martin</a> lives on this address. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11688.132s">He</a> wishes me to bring this point up. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11691.093s">I</a> really would feel, I think, you know, we live in a time where we can make that possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11697.015s">So</a> I would like to suggest, once again, a friendly amendment that we, for now, <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11701.351s">I</a> think we can all agree that this is probably for the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11703.853s">I</a> leave my cell phone because I get texts during meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11705.874s">I</a> don't prefer, I don't like it either. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11707.495s">I</a> get the same kind of, and I don't want to, you know, I don't think it's fair for me to like, hey Mia, do you really want to do this? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11712.518s">Let's</a> go. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11712.878s">I</a> mean, that's, that's also seems to be subverting the spirit. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11716.38s">But</a> on the same token, I think it's important for us to pursue avenues that people that do have serious issues that they can't come to meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11723.552s">can</a> also have a means of communicating with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11725.612s">And</a> I'd like to look that we think about ways to make that possible in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11729.533s">If</a> I can make a friendly amendment for us to sort of figure out the wording together now.<h2><a href="../2018-05-22_ACxsV5H4ehA/2018-05-22_ACxsV5H4ehA.html">School Committee Meeting 05/21/18</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=63.902s">So</a> I'm just trying to find the page number here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=67.763s">It's</a> from the warrant, 18-0-1-3-8. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=70.805s">This</a> is a Minuteman Regional High School tuition out of state, out of, sorry, district tuition expenses.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=79.408s">Eight</a> of 11, excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=81.549s">It's</a> fourth from the bottom. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=84.39s">I</a> just wanted to know, what are the two programs that most of the students are enrolled in?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=102.685s">It's</a> the Minuteman Regional High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=105.087s">Oh,</a> Minuteman. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=105.547s">The</a> out-of-district.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=134.065s">Do</a> you know, of this program, what is the one that most of the students are enrolled in? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=139.167s">Plumbing.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=139.447s">Is</a> it plumbing? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=140.287s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=140.768s">Plumbing</a> still?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=156.773s">How</a> many kids do we have currently in the program?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=170.957s">Could</a> you just give me a breakdown of the program when you have time? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=173.038s">Certainly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=173.678s">Can</a> you give me a breakdown of what programs are enrolled in? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=175.358s">Absolutely,</a> ma'am. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=176.378s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=187.607s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1279.968s">So</a> we had the reddismith and the landscaper and I, we walked the area and sort of viewed and we also did some soil tests. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1289.173s">For</a> the high bush blueberries, the soil isn't quite acidic enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1292.876s">If</a> possible, I'm happy to donate the plastic mulch, the thyme, and also the sulfur. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1297.717s">But</a> if possible, I'd like to start preparing the soil so we can get the pH. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1302.419s">Right</a> now the pH is around 6, which is kind of, it's way too high for blueberries. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1307.64s">So</a> we have to drop that around to about 4.5 or 5. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1309.98s">So</a> I'm happy to donate all the preparations for blueberries, but these other plants that were chosen, I looked them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1316.442s">and</a> I talked to some horticultural friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1317.883s">These</a> are all really great plants that they've chosen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1320.625s">We</a> just have to touch up a little bit with the blueberries.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1325.789s">Well,</a> it depends. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1326.93s">If</a> the club would like to plant this September, there's a couple of options that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1332.634s">It</a> would be best to rototill the area for the blueberries. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1335.876s">I</a> already have about 30 plants in containers, and I have all the plastic mulch. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1340.54s">So</a> what I would recommend would be to rototill the area, spread some sulfur, <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1346.483s">and</a> then give it a couple of months, and then we can apply some, I have prepared some acidic wood chips, so that'll help as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1357.025s">And</a> I would prefer to get that done as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1359.626s">It'll</a> take me probably about a couple of days, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1362.226s">I</a> just need to rototill it, lay down the plastic mulch. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1365.787s">We</a> have to measure it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1366.647s">I</a> also can, I'll send down all the drip irrigation.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1381.533s">Yes,</a> of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1382.154s">Happy</a> to.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1408.178s">close</a> to the school This would be up to the school committee how we handle this problem the way I handle this on my farm is we have an electric fence and <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1420.268s">I'm</a> happy to, once again, I'll donate the T-poles and the wiring, and I'll set it up for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1426.692s">My</a> fence has 7,000 volts that run through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1428.913s">Obviously</a> it won't hurt anyone, but it could be a great prank for kids to mess around with, so we'll have to talk with the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1435.196s">If</a> you want me to install it, we definitely need to shut it down during school hours, and we'll have to talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1441.499s">But</a> it's possible we could turn it on once school is not in session, and then I could put it on a timer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1447.483s">And</a> then we can shut it off once it's around 8 o'clock and deer won't bother you.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1460.918s">We'll</a> talk about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1463.44s">We</a> could actually choose a lower voltage. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1465.482s">I</a> have a higher voltage on my farm because I want the deers to get shocked. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1468.824s">But</a> if we have people around, we can have a lower voltage. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1473.027s">It's</a> basically like someone, a little bee sting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1477.59s">Like</a> someone hits you kind of hard with a pencil eraser is what it feels like. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1481.668s">it</a> doesn't leave any permanent damage. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1483.349s">It's</a> humane to the animals as well.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1489.714s">Yeah,</a> we'd have to figure out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1491.595s">If</a> you want, I'll be happy to lay down the fence.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1494.997s">Or</a> we'll hold off. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1496.098s">That's</a> fine, too.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1499.22s">No,</a> I understand.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1559.766s">Kreatz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1563.428s">Supporting</a> the Tilling.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2086.948s">I</a> just want to comment how awesome that little bag is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2088.949s">Thank</a> you so much for putting that together as a father who's about to have a kid go into kindergarten. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2093.533s">It's</a> a pretty frightening time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2094.914s">So</a> I think that makes a lot of people a little more nervous.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2098.537s">And</a> it only gets worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2099.418s">Yeah,</a> I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2100.259s">Or</a> so I've heard.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2121.488s">Do</a> you know, have you heard much interest expressed in the community about starting a pre-K program that's also available for everyone?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2153.356s">Do</a> we have a sense of what the cost of that kind of program would be in the community?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2158.559s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2158.879s">Could</a> we ask that as a report to the superintendent, that we could ask to see how much a universal pre-K program would cost Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2165.362s">I</a> know there's a cost associated, but it'd be interesting to at least know the figures. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2169.984s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3040.554s">Thank</a> you so much for this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3042.255s">First</a> off I'm just educational and a huge fan of after school tutoring programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3047.458s">I</a> know from my own students I feel like you know during class I could just sort of run them in circles sometimes when I was one on one with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3054.821s">That's</a> when the learning really happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3057.284s">But</a> to that point, I noticed in your report, as you mentioned, the ratio of students to teachers is probably not ideal. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3065.897s">Do</a> you think that if we added two more teachers to the program, that would have really solved the problem? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3070.381s">Or</a> do you think, how many teachers would you have wanted ideally?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3097.602s">Cool.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3097.962s">Please</a> let me know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3099.203s">So</a> if you ever need help in that way, I'm always happy to find one or two days a week to help you out.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3106.19s">I</a> need the teaching hours for my license anyway to keep it good. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3109.824s">My</a> second point is, can you just give me a sense of what percentage, I know maybe you don't have the numbers handy right now, but of the 68 students that participated in the program, how many used the bus? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3121.595s">Just</a> ballpark.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3144.002s">The</a> next question I have for you is, do you know why all these students were participating? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3148.408s">Has</a> there been any conversation with the parents? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3150.11s">Is</a> it just that their parents want them to have more math time? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3153.413s">The</a> students are hungry for more math time? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3155.556s">Or</a> is it they saw their MCAS scores and it was like, let's just put out fires?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3184.454s">Yeah,</a> I mean, in the future, I think that these type of, and I would like to sort of make this point to my colleagues as well, I think that for our school district to be one of the best in Massachusetts, this is the type of program we're gonna have to have district-wide, because I've seen how effective they can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3200.567s">Now,</a> for me, when I was a teacher, it was math club, but there were some parents, I was like, yeah, it's not, bring them to math club, it's okay, I'll make sure we find some time for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3209.611s">And</a> it has a huge impact on students, especially when it's in a small environment, more intimate. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3214.744s">So</a> I'd really like to start thinking about turning this into <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3218.005s">a</a> district-wide program if we can and sort of use Columbus as a pilot, learn what we can from it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3223.188s">So</a> thank you so much for all this hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3224.708s">I'm</a> really very excited about moving forward.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3232.052s">You</a> know, as, you know, Member DiVendetto mentioned, you know, unfortunately, this program came about sort of in an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3239.136s">We</a> had to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3239.976s">But</a> I think that, you know, now that the fire is out, there's a lot that we can learn moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3244.959s">So</a> thank you so much.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3793.491s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3793.972s">That's</a> all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3797.876s">I</a> think it's really important that we design this program to touch both students that are struggling and students that are excelling. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3808.975s">What</a> I found personally, there's a really great program called the AMC8s. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3813.498s">Currently</a> I'm talking with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3815.219s">Carolyn</a> Joy about this idea of maybe we could add this to the curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3819.021s">They're</a> really wonderful because AM, the American Math Competition, and they're designed for eighth graders. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3826.065s">When</a> I taught them to seventh and eighth graders, the problems themselves aren't just like, you know, where's the formula, chunk the formula, and you're done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3833.069s">They</a> actually involve a lot of creativity. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3835.21s">and</a> they feel a lot more like undergraduate mathematics, as it should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3839.532s">So</a> the problems are very engaging to students. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3841.473s">Sometimes</a> it could just be the type of thing where you print out a big packet of problems to students, hand them to them, <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3848.28s">help</a> out the kids that are, you know, struggling a bit, and then check in with your students that are really accelerating. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3855.845s">I</a> think that, I mean, from my own educational experience, I really saw a huge impact, because, you know, math can be, you know, it's taught, and this isn't anyone's fault, obviously, but when you're teaching to a test, <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3867.032s">Math</a> can seem soulless, but the AMC 8s, you really feel the creativity and the beauty of mathematics, which is something we really should have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3876.922s">Students</a> really should touch that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3879.484s">So</a> I would just, while I understand the cost and I certainly appreciate it, <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3883.963s">Sometimes,</a> you know, kids that are accelerating really can kind of cruise a little bit while teachers help the ones that are struggling, give some challenging, more advanced problems to those students so they can get a taste of what math really feels like. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3897.906s">Because,</a> you know, it's a beautiful subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3899.947s">So</a> I hope we can design this program and I hope we can pilot this program for the whole district.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4725.128s">Yeah,</a> I had a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4726.809s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4727.289s">Do</a> you know if there's interest in the student body in other languages, other than the romance languages?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6250.049s">So</a> of this A team and B team, it's not simply that we can put the B team at the Andrews and the A teams at the McGlynn.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6325.186s">To</a> just transfer them? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6326.648s">Like</a> once they're, let's say they get to, you have a newcomer student, he's a really quick learner, he moves up to level four. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6333.077s">Couldn't</a> we just move him to the other school?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6409.348s">Can</a> I follow up, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6412.51s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6412.951s">So</a> I guess my concern would be when you have a large concentration of EL students at one school, then you also have EL parents also at that same school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6424.279s">It</a> creates an environment where you might have one program just happens to be wealthier because of the socio dynamics versus the other program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6434.046s">I</a> mean, I think that we have to recognize as a board that there aren't necessarily perfect solutions <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6440.092s">But</a> do we have a sense of how many students are in the A team versus the B team?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6451.758s">If</a> you had to like just give me a rough estimate, I'm not trying to put you on the spot.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6978.046s">Just</a> one of the options that have been floated with some of the parents that have talked to me about this issue is this idea of creating a language magnet school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6986.475s">at</a> the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6987.796s">So</a> it would be the reason why people want to go there is that they actually maybe has a full bilingual option. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6994.479s">So</a> every kid that goes through the McGlynn gets both, I don't know, whichever of the EL students that you have the most of, and that language. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7004.585s">Could</a> you give me, I mean, I know that I'm asking you to do a lot of ballparking, but is such a program possible? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7010.268s">Is</a> that an option that's on our table?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7042.978s">Are</a> there any other magnet schools in the area that do either Haitian Creole or Portuguese?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7071.182s">So</a> if we did a bilingual Portuguese magnet school, we'd be the only one in the state that has that program, is that correct?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7084.875s">I</a> know of no Haitian Creole... Could you give us a sense of what it would take to actually architect <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7090.513s">like</a> bill for that type of program?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7137.66s">So</a> just one last point. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7140.24s">So</a> if we did a bilingual Haitian Creole program, every teacher that's in there now, we'd have to find a new home for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7148.111s">And</a> we'd have to make sure that, or at least they find a way to get certified in Haitian Creole.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8125.338s">Yeah,</a> just two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8127.138s">The</a> first is on subsection four, where you talk of provisions for quality control. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8132.241s">Before</a> I, I just, I really do support the idea of doing partnership programs with local universities. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8137.985s">I</a> really commend the administration for working on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8140.267s">I</a> know you guys have been cooking this up since like December. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8143.249s">But</a> could you just outline what are the provisions for quality control? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8147.332s">Because</a> we're allowing them to hire the contractors, how do we really know that they won't shaft us?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8178.31s">And</a> sort of just to branch off Paul's concern, which is my concern as well, I just want to understand, so prevailing wages, how do we know that let's say they find some company, they say, oh, they're prevailing wages, don't worry about it.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8194.823s">All</a> that will be verified and we'll make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8196.964s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8197.345s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8197.865s">Once</a> again, I just really appreciate all the work you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8199.386s">No,</a> no, it's good that you're asking because I want you to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8201.187s">I</a> just want to make sure that we're all on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8203.189s">There's</a> no disasters. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8204.85s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9316.724s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9318.486s">I</a> mean, I know the administration is working very hard to deal with this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9322.068s">I</a> hate to funnel Cassandra, but this is a very frustrating report to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9326.032s">I</a> think we all kind of hoped it would go away, but here we are now at the last minute with no options of really solving it other than <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9334.531s">take</a> them all from Brooks, which means that 33% of one out of every three kids that applied to go to the Andrews might get sent to the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9343.637s">That's</a> what it means, one out of every three. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9345.599s">Or</a> we take 11% out of the general population, and we say to the 16 kids that go to McGlynn Elementary that they're just, you know, even though that they want to go to Andrews, you know, they went to the McGlynn, they kind of want to do something new, you know, we're saying you also have to <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9362.304s">to</a> handle that, so this is a very frustrating report to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9365.366s">What's</a> most frustrating about this whole point is sort of this false choice that's being laid out in front of us that, oh, you can choose, but they're equal. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9376.275s">Then</a> why are you choosing? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9378.256s">If</a> these schools are equivalent, they're truly equivalent, then why choose? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9383.6s">Okay,</a> we have more room for ELL students at one school, I understand that, but it's just everyone's randomly drawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9391.579s">You</a> know, or there's a reason to choose one school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9394.0s">You</a> know, maybe having, I love the idea of having a Haitian Creole magnet school in Medford, make us unique in Massachusetts, but that's a huge investment of time and energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9405.164s">Maybe</a> we could do a math magnet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9406.865s">That</a> might be easier to draw our STEM magnet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9409.966s">Might</a> be easier to create one school has more of a STEM focus, and the school has more of a liberal arts focus. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9415.568s">These</a> are choices that we could have made, and now here we are at the 11th hour, and those choices are, <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9421.471s">not</a> in front of us anymore.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9473.453s">That's</a> our choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9474.934s">That's</a> our choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9475.514s">I</a> understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9476.034s">I'm</a> not trying to take someone to the woodshed here, and that's not my intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9479.996s">I</a> think what's frustrating to me about this report is I think it was kind of obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9485.279s">We</a> all kind of saw it coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9486.28s">We</a> just hoped it wouldn't be here at the 11th hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9489.601s">What</a> I would like to suggest is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9491.602s">I</a> mean, no matter what we decide, it's going to cause a little bit of trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9497.125s">But</a> it seems like if we expect that every school sort of has a reasonable distribution, it seems only fair to me that the Brooks School would be, you know, we say 17 or 20 kids have to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9510.271s">And</a> that just, you know, maybe that seems, you know, when we think of like what is fair for the community, is it fair for the entire community to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9520.428s">Oh,</a> you know, you're at the McGlynn Elementary. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9523.19s">There's</a> 16 kids there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9524.911s">You</a> know, these are people that, friends that want to be together. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9528.394s">They</a> also should share, even though their school doesn't have this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9532.497s">So</a> in the future, I would really like to start considering more seriously the idea that there is a choice to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9538.822s">Right</a> now, there isn't, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9541.083s">We're</a> saying they're equal, they're both great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9543.525s">Then</a> it's a false choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9545.186s">Let's</a> have a reason for kids to go to one school versus the other.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9578.176s">I</a> am in strong support of a weighted average option. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9581.939s">That</a> might be another way to play it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9583.88s">I</a> think that it seems only fair that we expect every school to basically feed into one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9588.143s">And</a> unfortunately, that means one school will have more of a percentage of kids broken up.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10460.019s">Yeah,</a> just two points. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10460.98s">I</a> mean, first, I just want to address the community at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10463.722s">Obviously,</a> this is not a choice anyone here wants to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10466.363s">Everyone</a> wants everyone to get what they want or, you know, with their kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10471.056s">just</a> talking about sort of the choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10473.477s">So</a> we're going to have to do a lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10474.758s">We're</a> basically forced into this choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10476.258s">The</a> question is, what is most fair and what is best? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10479.459s">So</a> I think we can all kind of agree that what's most fair is sending kids from the school that is only sending 9% of their students. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10488.703s">What's</a> best also, though, if we're trying to prevent friends from being broken up, <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10494.077s">That's</a> the best way to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10495.838s">Have</a> one school that's not sending their kids actually make, because the probability, if you have three buddies, of two of them getting selected, so at least you have Tom, you might not have Bob, but at least you have Tom with you, is much, much better. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10512.29s">But</a> if we have a system where 11% of every school is dropped off, we're going to be breaking up friendships, and the likelihood is they're not going to have cohorts with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10524.573s">So</a> I think that we're looking at, we're surveying what's not only best and fairest, but what is best for the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10532.037s">And</a> I really do believe that this plan of Paul's, which is something we're kind of cooking up with two minds while he worked in parallel, I guess is the phrase. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10541.123s">I</a> feel like this is the best way forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10544.104s">It's</a> best for the students and it's fairest.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10576.523s">May</a> I make a friendly amendment to that?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10580.405s">Is</a> it possible, seeing that we only need 17 students, would be acceptable?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10618.0s">Well,</a> let's ask the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10619.241s">We</a> have the experts right before us.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10660.664s">We</a> have a parent that would like to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10665.068s">Your</a> name and address, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10669.452s">Hi,</a> I'm Jenny Graham, 7 Ronalee Road.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11130.387s">Absolutely,</a> yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11131.308s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11132.569s">I'm</a> done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11132.789s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11133.509s">One</a> last point in support of this idea of Mr. Tucci going down. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11136.531s">I</a> think it's important for the community that <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11141.262s">We</a> don't want kids to just be forced at the last minute with no recall. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11144.964s">We</a> want parents to have as many options as they can and many possibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11148.946s">And</a> if we can get 10 people to move over, that's only five that we have to select from the rest of the cohort. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11155.99s">So</a> I really do support this idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11158.051s">I</a> think either we're paying now or we're paying later, because there's going to be feelings about this, especially when we're taking such a large percentage.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11637.041s">Overall,</a> I definitely support the spirit. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11638.622s">I</a> mean, I leave my cell phone in the car for this very reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11641.003s">You</a> know, I have my computer here, but I'm not receiving texts to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11645.066s">But</a> I think it's important for us to recognize as a group <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11648.225s">that</a> we live in an age where people that do have serious disabilities can still participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11653.747s">And</a> it would be great if we create an environment for that to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11657.468s">I</a> agree that we should have all of our personal, like, you know, someone shouldn't be sending member Ruggiero a message or member Paul a message, because that's kind of, it's kind of working beyond the spirit of open meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11670.331s">But</a> it would be nice if we had a number or a Twitter feed or something where maybe the chair could make, <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11677.844s">You</a> know, Martin, who has a serious disability, wasn't able to come today. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11683.93s">So,</a> but he had a really great suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11686.653s">Martin</a> lives on this address. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11688.114s">He</a> wishes me to bring this point up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11691.077s">I</a> really would feel, I think, you know, we live in a time where we can make that possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11697.003s">So</a> I would like to suggest, once again, a friendly amendment that we, for now, <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11701.334s">I</a> think we can all agree that this is probably for the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11703.836s">I</a> leave my cell phone because I get texts during meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11705.857s">I</a> don't prefer, I don't like it either. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11707.478s">I</a> get the same kind of, and I don't want to, you know, I don't think it's fair for me to like, hey Mia, do you really want to do this? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11712.481s">Let's</a> go. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11712.861s">I</a> mean, that's, that's also seems to be subverting the spirit. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11716.363s">But</a> on the same token, I think it's important for us to pursue avenues that people that do have serious issues that they can't come to meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11723.535s">can</a> also have a means of communicating with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11725.596s">And</a> I'd like to look that we think about ways to make that possible in the future, if I can make a friendly amendment for us to sort of figure out the wording together now.<h2><a href="../2018-05-09_bCMsj8WYK14/2018-05-09_bCMsj8WYK14.html">Medford School Committee meeting May 7, 2018</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4610.266s">Chief</a> Sacco, can I ask you a question, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4618.548s">So</a> reading through the report, I can understand some of the teachers' frustrations. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4622.909s">I</a> just want to make sure this is absolutely clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4626.791s">Do</a> you or any of your officers believe that Superintendent Belson floated a conspiracy theory that perhaps there was some sort of setup? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4638.461s">I</a> just want to make sure absolutely clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4640.823s">I</a> think the answer is obvious, but I want to make sure from your mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4644.286s">So</a> none of your officers feel like there was any sort of a sense of Roy Belson trying to say there was some cabal to take down the principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4652.192s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4701.392s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4701.752s">I</a> just want to make, from my opinion, from talking, I've had the opportunity, the blessing of talking to a number of the teachers, and I've also talked to a number of the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4712.527s">I've</a> heard so many wonderful things about how hardworking <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4716.848s">almost</a> with, I can't even think of an exception, all of the McGlynn teachers I've talked with. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4723.312s">And</a> I just want to express my sincere gratitude for all the hard work you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4729.656s">As</a> a former teacher myself, I was never a successful middle school teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4734.559s">I</a> find middle school teaching the most difficult of all teaching. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4738.782s">And</a> so I have a deep, deep appreciation for all the hard work you do, and I thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4745.866s">I</a> hope that it's pretty clear that this is maybe a misreading or misunderstanding of what the report was made. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4753.35s">I</a> do not believe that Roy Bellson ever tried to throw the teachers under the bus as if any of you would ever lay bullets in an auditorium in a safe space. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4763.835s">I</a> just can't imagine any of you doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4765.496s">So</a> thank you, and I'm sorry about this miscommunication.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5904.357s">How</a> the issue was brought up, it was, I was under the impression that we were going to discuss the transition strategy. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5913.819s">That</a> is the notice that was made. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5916.56s">I</a> didn't, it would have probably been more helpful to the community and to me as a member if the discussion was about continuing Roy Belson's contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5927.735s">Because</a> I wasn't, personally, I wasn't really prepared to have all the reasons and to rehash through the argument other than what I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5937.63s">But</a> I share your concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5939.668s">because</a> I do believe that it was an important decision to make and I think more community input would have been very helpful, as I made clear during the meeting.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5968.154s">Yeah,</a> but it doesn't say that Roy, just a clarification, it does not say that in addition, Roy Bellson's contract may be extended. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5976.562s">The</a> idea of the, while what we, I do not claim that what we did was a violation of open meeting law, I don't think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5982.768s">It</a> wasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5983.148s">But</a> it would have been more clear to the community if that issue of Roy Bellson's extended contract was made more apparent.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6037.199s">To</a> add on to that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6039.066s">To</a> add on to that point, I mean, I would like to suggest that these important decisions are made during regular committee meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6046.811s">I</a> understand that sometimes we do need to go into executive session or committee of the wholes, but that particular issue should have been televised so the whole community could hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6058.679s">It's</a> unfortunate that the community had to sort of hear about it secondhand. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6064.383s">It</a> creates an environment of mistrust.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7352.819s">I</a> wanted to address a couple of the other points that we've sort of moved past, including the public records requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7358.928s">It's</a> important that the public as being a public body, we are under all the laws that govern public requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7367.98s">So</a> we have a subcommittee of community relations, but I think this issue is sort of, I would like to have all the members present. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7374.225s">So</a> I'd like to make a motion that we have a committee of the whole meeting where we can address, go through all of the items that are important, including maybe having a mic stand in the back corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7384.393s">So,</a> you know, if there is a disabled person, we could just hand them the mic. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7388.632s">or</a> talking about public requests, where all these issues can be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7392.394s">So</a> I'd like, like I said, to make a motion that we have a committee of the whole meeting to address all community engagements.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7413.647s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7413.947s">I</a> mean, I've made public requests and people have been very helpful, but it's unacceptable that emails bounce. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7419.632s">But</a> beyond that, there are other issues that we need to discuss about community engagement, community relation. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7424.956s">I'd</a> like to do that as a body. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7426.457s">So</a> that'd be my motion.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7453.133s">Well,</a> we can work with the chair and just sort of add items on the agenda that would be, like we normally would when we have a meeting request. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7461.077s">But</a> basically the broad outline would be <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7464.612s">how</a> to discuss increasing community engagement on the school committee.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9354.015s">So</a> I just want to make this clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9355.136s">Right</a> now, we have a disparity of 29 children. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9357.838s">So</a> if 29 of the 100. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9360.1s">No,</a> 29 of the 176 went to the McGlynn, it would be equal. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9363.883s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9365.384s">That's</a> my math. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9367.105s">If</a> we were.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9371.809s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9372.169s">OK,</a> I'll believe you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9373.19s">So</a> I'm just trying to, once again, trying to get the 15 to 20. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9377.874s">So</a> if we're in a buffer of 15, that would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9382.614s">So</a> one school has... Right.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9399.466s">So</a> we need to convince 14 students, basically. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9404.184s">14</a> on the, that would be the most, if we can convince 14 students, are there any incentives that we can offer other than low class size that we can offer to those 14 students? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9413.869s">Like</a> is it possible we could identify the cohorts? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9416.991s">So</a> these are 10 kids that just definitely want to be together, they're buddies. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9421.214s">And</a> so we're gonna make sure that they go over and we can get to our 14.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9543.909s">My</a> question, so I just want to know when is the deadline we have to decide exactly on the lottery?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11113.106s">I</a> just want to remind the body that soccer is the leading cause of concussion among women and girls. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11118.25s">And</a> it's also in the top two or three among boys. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11121.392s">So</a> there's a serious concussion risk in soccer. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11124.954s">People</a> don't think it's a contact sport, but it really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11127.476s">And</a> it's often caused, I mean, my wife sees it.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13009.36s">Thank</a> you once again for your service. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13011.901s">I</a> just had a quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13013.182s">Do</a> we participate in the American Math Competition, the AMC 8s, AMC 10s, AMC 12s?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13042.93s">Yeah,</a> the AMCAs are just tests.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13062.424s">Do</a> we do that in the middle school, the eighth grade AMCs?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14571.36s">Yeah,</a> I just have two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14572.48s">Thank</a> you so much for putting this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14574.641s">On</a> page one of 13, this is of the financial year budget expenditure. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14579.683s">Could</a> you just explain what errors and omissions, what that line item is?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14587.145s">I</a> see, I see. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14587.805s">Okay,</a> thank you just for clarifying that for my brain. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14590.206s">I'm</a> a little sleepy right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14592.027s">And</a> also, on page two of 13, I had a question about the photocopy lease and purchase.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14615.944s">Those</a> are my questions.<h2><a href="../2018-04-10_vqZ0fsWQ1g0/2018-04-10_vqZ0fsWQ1g0.html">Medford School Committee meeting April 9, 2018</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1197.68s">Kreatz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1198.281s">Just</a> a question for Superintendent Delson through you, the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1202.662s">In</a> your cost benefit analysis, could you also include the timescale for implementation? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1206.464s">I'm</a> sure you will anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1207.484s">I</a> just want to make sure that that's going to be part of your analysis.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1231.272s">That'd</a> be perfect, because I imagine the cost to add numbers to the doors, it's not gonna cost a lot of money, but it'll take a lot of time for everyone to put the numbers on.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1677.534s">I</a> want a clarification.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1679.275s">So</a> what would this study, I'm just trying to understand exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1681.976s">So</a> it's just going to be a number of people that walk through the door every day?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1698.691s">Through</a> the chair, before we vote on this motion, is it possible you could do a foot traffic study? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1702.933s">Is</a> that going to be much more difficult, Superintendent Belson, or?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1755.764s">Are</a> there motion detectors that can be used in front of these doors? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1761.21s">Because</a> then you could just do, like, just click in?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1800.93s">If</a> it's possible, I'm not too interested in seeing that you have all the video cameras right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1804.571s">Could</a> you just have the person at the desk take a rolling tally of how many times people go through each door? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1810.752s">It</a> shouldn't be too difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1811.913s">If</a> they walk through the pool door, they just put a little hash mark on that.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1818.895s">Of</a> course, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1819.335s">It</a> might not be a perfect study. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1820.175s">You</a> get a general sense.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1825.857s">And</a> there are other times of the day where it's pretty difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1828.598s">I'd</a> like to make a friendly amendment to the motion that if we could just have a foot traffic study of all the doors, seeing that we're going to be doing anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1838.378s">of</a> the, well, that all the doors that are, all the doors.

 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2957.567s">I</a> just, if I could have a point of clarification, I just want to make sure exactly what's going to be on the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2962.368s">Can</a> you just walk us through that, what the particulars of that report would be?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3039.0s">Would</a> on that report as well also be the department they're a part of and the school that they're working at, whether it's elementary versus high school? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3046.622s">I'm</a> not sure.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3051.563s">So</a> just being alphabetical. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3056.907s">Would</a> it be very difficult to add that information in addition?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3099.012s">I</a> see. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3099.613s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4584.196s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4584.716s">I</a> wanted to know, have you noticed like a spike or change in incidents of reporting? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4588.379s">I'm</a> just speaking from your personal experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4590.2s">Obviously</a> you don't have the numbers in front of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4593.184s">Has</a> the rate been consistent, or have you noticed a spike?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4600.746s">In</a> the past few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4601.706s">Have</a> you noticed, like I'm just talking about the general trend. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4604.647s">Would</a> you say that the trend of bullying has increased, decreased, or remained about the same?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4646.983s">Madam</a> Speaker, I'd like to recommend that we have like to make a motion that we review this issue at a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4654.288s">I</a> feel like there's enough here just there's we we have enough questions between us just and I would like to specifically look at cyber issues as well.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4952.43s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7248.778s">Yeah,</a> when I was on the campaign trail, I was really surprised at the number of really brilliant professors at local institutions that live in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7258.565s">While</a> I was campaigning, I knocked on one man's door. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7260.606s">And</a> when I told him I taught mathematics, he quizzed me on a bunch of questions, because he was one of the developers of the MRI. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7268.992s">After</a> sort of talking to these people, some of them said that they would enjoy actually coming into Medford High School and maybe making brief presentations. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7277.867s">If</a> we could, obviously we don't want to interrupt curriculum because we have state mandated priorities that we have to do, but if we found you these volunteer professors, would we be able to fit them into our schools?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8204.966s">I'm</a> sorry for my ignorance of this, but what is SBIRT?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8754.252s">Thank</a> you, Superintendent, for putting together this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8757.493s">I</a> was just curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8758.953s">So</a> on this page right here, when you say 122 children, that's the current <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8763.775s">number</a> of students applying that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8765.936s">Do</a> we have a sense of how many students have applied to be a part of that program?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8783.771s">Is</a> it possible you could just put in the information of how many students have applied for these programs? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8788.695s">We</a> can get that for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8789.756s">Thanks.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8954.919s">Madam</a> Speaker for the next item on our agenda I'd like to move that we go into executive session.<h2><a href="../2018-04-05_TayqV05M2I0/2018-04-05_TayqV05M2I0.html">Medford School Committee - Superintendent Interviews - Night 2 - 04/04/18</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2082.724s">Good</a> evening, Doctor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2085.567s">You</a> started as the instructional superintendent in Boston Public Schools in 2015, is that correct?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2125.803s">I</a> see. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2127.164s">So</a> while I was researching the Boston public school system, I came across a surprising trend that was talked about in Boston Magazine. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2136.071s">When</a> you started in 2015, Boston Magazine stated that your district spent about $17,000, $17,500 per pupil, and it ranked your district 116 out of 125 area schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2151.355s">Despite</a> spending about $2,000 more per pupil since 2015, the ranking over your tenure actually slipped, and now some educational experts rank the Boston Public Schools among the five lower ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2165.579s">I</a> wanted you to comment on that, and I was wondering, what do you think that Boston Magazine might have missed over the couple of years that you've been working in the Boston Public School system?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2349.178s">Yeah,</a> when I was a teacher in Houston, before that I mostly did private schools, so my experience was more of children of affluence. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2358.622s">And</a> then when I started teaching in Houston, it was sort of that big transition of children that had a lot of trauma, a lot of poverty. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2364.842s">Thankfully,</a> I had a number of really great principals that sort of helped me adjust my teaching style, which needed adjustment. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2370.786s">I</a> wondered, how would you, how do you help teachers like myself, or teachers that don't necessarily come from high trauma, high poverty environments, and how would you educate them to help integrate that into their teaching style?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2479.994s">And</a> finally on this topic, I sort of want to take a case study real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2483.915s">I</a> was reading through the Department of Education, the 2015-2016 reports, and it was showing how minority children and children with disabilities are often disciplined at higher rates with more severe outcomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2499.599s">So</a> I would like to sort of create a case study, and I would like you to imagine a teacher <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2504.218s">that</a> you notice a similar trend, that for similar discipline situations, they tend to be disciplining children who are minorities and children in poverty with disabilities at a more severe rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2516.608s">How</a> would you adjust that teacher's style, and how would you communicate the problem to that teacher?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5151.646s">Thank</a> you, Doctor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5152.267s">I</a> have some operational questions for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5156.85s">So</a> first, I would like you to imagine that you have a vacancy in your sixth grade for a sixth grade teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5164.076s">I</a> would like you to walk us through your process of how you would acquire a nice set of resumes, what you would look for in those resumes, and ultimately, how you would interview them and then select one of the candidates.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5425.945s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5426.925s">My</a> next question involves, I would like you to assume you have a very talented and hardworking principal, but they have a particular set of teachers or maybe just one teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5435.933s">that's</a> not doing very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5437.514s">They</a> fail a large number of their students. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5440.016s">How</a> would you help that, after you've shown the data, you know, that this teacher still hasn't changed their style, how do you help that teacher move on to a more effective position, or when do you decide when to let go of a teacher?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5535.506s">And</a> finally, community engagement is a critical part to a successful budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5541.79s">How</a> would you work with the residents of Medford after your first draft is created for your budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5549.012s">How</a> would you help sort of get the people of Medford on board with it and how would you integrate their criticisms?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=6808.777s">Thank</a> you, good evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=6810.84s">On</a> your resume, you listed data-informed decision-making as one of your core competencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=6817.308s">With</a> some of the flaws and the issues with the MCAS and any data set, I wonder how do you separate the signal from the noise when you evaluate student performance?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=6925.27s">Mentioning</a> accountability, I was curious, how do you go about evaluating teachers in this regard? <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=6932.99s">As</a> you look over student performance, you put your picture together, which involves some data. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=6936.871s">How</a> do you look over teacher performance? <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=6939.351s">Sure.</a> 
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7049.591s">And</a> finally, when you look over the data information about teachers and students, what do you think is the hardest or the hardest field of goals for your students to achieve moving forward?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=10156.437s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=10156.837s">I</a> have some questions about blind spots and pitfalls. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=10161.388s">My</a> first question is, in your decades of experience in education, what common pitfalls do you see superintendents fall into, and how would you avoid falling into those traps?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=10356.708s">Also,</a> I'd like you to tell me about, tell us about a time that you were taking an action, it wasn't quite proper, and you had a mentor adjust your behavior. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=10368.355s">And</a> tell us about what led you in the wrong direction, how were you adjusted?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=11029.38s">Follow</a> up, Mr. Oshiro? <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=11031.002s">You</a> used the phrase robust curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=11033.966s">Can</a> you explain what that means exactly?<h2><a href="../2018-04-05_O8bUu4AaRl4/2018-04-05_O8bUu4AaRl4.html">Medford School Committee - Superintendent Interviews - Night 1 - 04/02/18</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1040.216s">Dr.</a> Stray, as I was reviewing your resume, your special education work really stood out to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1046.442s">I</a> would like you to describe the most difficult dilemma you faced when you were managing the special education department in Andover. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1053.389s">And</a> as you address that challenge, <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1055.291s">I'd</a> like you to focus on three specific areas for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1057.953s">First,</a> what made your decision challenging? <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1061.375s">Second,</a> what interests were pitted against each other? <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1065.518s">And</a> third, ultimately, how did you mitigate some of the negative consequences of your decision to move forward?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1089.352s">And</a> ultimately, how did you mitigate some of the negative consequences of this decision?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2575.882s">Thank</a> you, Dr. Strait. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2576.763s">I</a> really enjoyed the conversation, talking about community engagement and successful budgeting, which involves a lot of what I was going to ask you next.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2590.31s">No,</a> no, they're perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2591.271s">I</a> apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2591.891s">They're</a> perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2592.771s">Speak</a> as long as you like. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2594.832s">So</a> I'm really interested in this conversation about strategic planning and turning that into budgeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2600.735s">So</a> I want to talk specifically, if you could, about how you involve the residents of Medford in subsequent drafts. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2609.198s">So</a> your team has come together, they've put together a strategic plan and a draft budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2613.879s">How</a> do you receive their input and how do you change the numbers based on that input? <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2619.321s">What</a> resources would you develop to augment limited funds? <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2623.883s">And</a> how would you hold your administration responsible for maintaining that budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2628.067s">Because,</a> you know, plans don't always work the way you think they will. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2632.151s">So</a> how do you identify when things begin to go wrong in the budget and then address that problem?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2835.911s">What</a> resources in the community would you develop to augment limited funds?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2897.491s">And</a> finally, what indicators do you look for to notice points where your plan is beginning to fail? <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2904.952s">And</a> how do you adjust them?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4322.749s">So</a> I'm a certified teacher myself, and one of the things that I think about a lot is this idea of risk in education and trying experimental new ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4332.658s">On</a> one hand, you want to try the most innovative approaches, but on the other hand, when you deviate from a known path, in some respects, you're risking educational time that will be lost on the student. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4344.409s">So</a> what I'm interested in knowing about is tell us about the most innovative educational practice you've tried, something that was experimental. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4355.336s">And</a> I would like to know about some of the resistance you received from the community and how you went along implementing that plan.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4952.832s">I</a> wanted to ask also about discipline, because I don't think we've asked a lot of those questions so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4957.216s">So</a> I want to give you a hypothetical situation, and I'd like to hear how you could address it for us.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4963.021s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4965.245s">So</a> I would like you to imagine a student who has filmed a teacher without the teacher's consent or knowledge and puts an inappropriate but not terrible voiceover over this YouTube video. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4983.8s">So</a> something that isn't inflammatory but something that is not really appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4988.783s">How</a> would you address that situation? <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4992.751s">Let's</a> assume this student has some discipline issues in the past, but nothing serious. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4998.015s">Similar</a> sorts of problems.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7488.402s">Mayor</a> Burke, first off, I just wanted to know, is the live stream okay?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7493.905s">Okay,</a> so that's being addressed okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7498.067s">So</a> here's my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7500.651s">Over</a> the past few days, I've been looking through my emails in preparation for these interviews. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7505.852s">What</a> has surprised me is how some very intelligent, passionate, and engaged parents of our community have lost faith in our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7513.774s">Some</a> have urged me not to consider any candidate from within our system, even as one as qualified as you. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7519.695s">To</a> these residents, how would you rebuild their faith? <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7523.856s">In</a> your experience, how is trust built? <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7526.479s">How</a> is it damaged? <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7527.94s">And</a> what actions can we take to ensure greater community participation at all levels of the Medford school system?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7649.728s">And</a> how would you work to, for some, I've talked to a number of parents and especially the ones in high school actually do have a very high opinion of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7658.26s">And</a> I just want to make sure I make that clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7660.723s">But</a> that said, I mean, among the other parents, how would we reach out to them to create a higher trust environment?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7748.442s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=9121.883s">As</a> all cities in Massachusetts, severe poverty touches the lives of some of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=9127.787s">What</a> types of challenges do you think that these children endure and how would you help them succeed?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=9220.121s">Would</a> you like to share a particular experience that you've had in particular dealing with a student that had severe poverty and how you helped them?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10650.754s">I'd</a> like to talk to you about budgeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10653.036s">So</a> community engagement is critical to a successful budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10656.418s">That</a> said, how would you construct your first draft of next year's school budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10661.782s">How</a> would you involve the residents of Medford in subsequent drafts? <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10666.465s">What</a> resources would you develop to augment limited funds? <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10670.688s">And</a> how would you hold your administration responsible for the budget itself?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10803.561s">Would</a> you engage with the community to do presentations for the budget and how would you receive their input as you move along?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10860.851s">Yeah,</a> and finally, how would you notice if there was a problem with the budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10865.42s">Because</a> it is, like you said, a fluid document. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10867.625s">So</a> what indicators would you look for when things start to go wrong, and how would you adjust it?<h2><a href="../2018-03-20_3N-X2ResFqI/2018-03-20_3N-X2ResFqI.html">School Committee meeting March 19, 2018</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=770.005s">So</a> you're asking for a committee of the whole specifically to handle, for these questions to be addressed?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=823.472s">Just</a> another question of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=826.016s">How</a> long would it take you to answer some of these questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=828.54s">I'm</a> just worried that we're going to go a little too fast. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=831.604s">I</a> mean, I'm inclined to second your motion so we can debate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=835.428s">But</a> I'm just, I wonder, how long would it take you to get this payroll information?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=855.559s">Could</a> I make a friendly amendment to your resolution before, could we make it in two weeks? <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=859.701s">One</a> week seems a little quick.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=863.949s">The</a> chair will call it at a reasonable time.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=891.941s">So</a> I'll second the motion.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1072.129s">Mr.</a> Ruggiero. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1073.79s">I</a> just have some questions for you cause you know, I'm concerned if there are issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1078.293s">It's</a> okay if we, if this is not the appropriate time for these questions, I just trying to get my head around all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1084.456s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1085.979s">If</a> the administration raises a base salary that's not a step increase, the school committee is notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1092.304s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1094.946s">So</a> the base can go up or down. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1097.769s">We're</a> not notified of those?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1181.878s">Could</a> you send us copies before the meeting of the digital, I have the digital teacher's contract, but it would be nice to have the other collective bargaining contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1192.044s">If</a> you could send that to all of us, that would be useful so I could review the information in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1198.747s">And</a> so every contract has different rules for step increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1202.95s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1204.171s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1204.631s">Oh,</a> so I see.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1221.922s">Right,</a> of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1223.363s">And</a> so you can have multiple step increases at once or would it just be one step at a time? <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1230.106s">Like</a> every year you would get no more than one step increase?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1246.051s">Okay,</a> that's all my questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1247.072s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2453.611s">Mr.</a> Ruggiero. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2459.712s">44,954</a> children's and young adult books. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2461.653s">A</a> mountain of material. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2463.433s">But</a> only one small part of what our library provides to the children of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2468.274s">Beyond</a> these books, or CDs, or DVDs, or curriculum support, <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2473.676s">hundreds</a> of story time hours and tutoring sessions, the most important parts of our city library are the safe halls sheltering the students of our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2485.284s">We</a> have all seen the pictures. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2487.846s">We</a> need a library without a leaking roof or rotting floors or flickering lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2493.59s">And</a> it is for this reason that I ask you to request that the city council approve the construction of a new space. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2502.319s">A</a> place where children can not only study for the MCAS, but also a space where WIM can take a child to the dialogues of Plato or the history of DNA. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2512.642s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2513.663s">Let's</a> build a new dry home for the greatest minds and a place for children to wander amongst them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2521.385s">A</a> few members wish to speak on this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2523.986s">I'd</a> like to invite them to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2527.507s">And</a> if anyone has any questions.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3720.761s">Is</a> it possible that we could have an official appreciation certification that we could do through the school committee?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5207.018s">Thank</a> you, Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5208.038s">I</a> just have one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5209.478s">So</a> I wanted to know, and maybe Member Mustone explained this, but I just wanted to know would <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5217.419s">parents</a> be able to also get an introductory meeting like what Alice is and why it's important and why we're choosing this? <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5223.422s">That</a> is a good question.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5226.763s">Is</a> it possible I'd like to make a motion that we pursue a community event because a number of parents have been asking me this very question. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5233.146s">So</a> we can actually have a full forum on what Alice is, why we're moving toward it, and why we think it's important for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5240.949s">Can</a> someone second that?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5576.788s">Yeah,</a> I just have a question about professional development days in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5580.749s">So</a> you would, usually the different topics be scheduled in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5585.371s">It</a> was just because of the current situation that we decided to move this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5588.412s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5589.052s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5590.464s">So</a> in terms of the ALICE program, I just wanted to know a little bit about how the decision was made to move forward with ALICE versus like these other programs that we're mentioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5603.131s">Yeah,</a> that was part of it.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5619.943s">So</a> we know that the Medford PD fully approves this program the most? <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5624.325s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5624.445s">OK,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5624.825s">That</a> helps me understand the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5626.166s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5643.996s">I</a> just wanted to clarify from my mindset. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5647.138s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6400.128s">Yes,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6401.108s">Thank</a> you very much for this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6402.969s">I</a> have a question for you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6404.549s">So</a> do you, if there is someone in the community that has the ability, like a retired individual, would it be possible that they could help tutor kids in these AP classes? <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6414.311s">I've</a> had a couple, when I was knocking on doors, reach out to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6416.692s">They</a> were retired professors of physics that might be interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6420.693s">Or</a> if you had someone in the community that was able to help out with tutoring, would you guys?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6495.407s">Could</a> I ask the deputy superintendent to look into how we could create such a program?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6526.746s">Perhaps</a> we could look at something doing in collaboration with the library.<h2><a href="../2018-03-06_Ybtx6JdbanI/2018-03-06_Ybtx6JdbanI.html">Medford School Committee Meeting March 5, 2018</a></h2>
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=946.283s">Yeah,</a> I just have a couple questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=947.684s">So</a> first, I'd like to offer a friendly amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=950.665s">Do</a> we need to have this information presented physically? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=953.866s">Is</a> it OK that we just have this information presented as an Excel file or comma delineated database? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=959.669s">Is</a> that OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=959.989s">Because</a> that's a lot of paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=961.129s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=963.53s">So</a> you want the physical? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=965.251s">I</a> want it in an Excel spreadsheet every time people want anything at all to be sensualized. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=980.703s">Yeah,</a> yeah, but I mean, I'm just a friendly man. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=991.557s">I</a> think that the paper version just that's a lot of I mean you're looking at <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=996.262s">A</a> lot of entries.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=998.563s">So</a> I would like to offer a friendly amendment if it's accepted that we have this information presented physically and if one of the members needs it to be printed out, then they can request it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1008.505s">But</a> for me, I would prefer to have this digitally. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1011.186s">If</a> I'm going to search it or scan it, I would need it digitally anyway.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1760.246s">I</a> just wanted to present that motion before. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1762.788s">Mary</a> member.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2952.065s">Yeah,</a> a couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2954.086s">So</a> when you say several RTI tutors, how many are we talking about per building? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2959.167s">Like</a> three or two?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2975.09s">And,</a> um, so I have a, this is on page two of the report and you say Renaissance is a difficult tool to utilize. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2982.133s">Do</a> you have sense of what the participation rate is among teachers? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2985.374s">Are</a> teachers using part of it now because it's too difficult? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2988.435s">They're</a> having trouble using it all? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2990.036s">I'm</a> just, what do you mean when you say Renaissance is a difficult tool to use?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3744.78s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3745.921s">Um,</a> so we, we, as the three members of the community relations subcommittee, we all worked out when would be the best time to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3754.549s">It's</a> going to be on March 9th from 1230 to one 30. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3758.032s">Um,</a> we cleared the date with the senior center. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3762.056s">So</a> that's where we'll be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3763.398s">And</a> it'll also just give opportunity for seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3766.483s">that</a> sometimes aren't able to come to our meetings or just have an opportunity to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3770.827s">All</a> the issues were forwarded to the superintendent and to the mayors. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3774.351s">I</a> think maybe just due to the timing of things and what's been going on lately, I think maybe it's been lost in the shuffle. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3780.617s">But</a> I'm going to make sure everything is going to be posted properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3783.119s">It's</a> also been posted in the senior newspaper that they have.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3791.824s">I'm</a> following up with the deputy superintendents to make sure everything is posted properly.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3801.047s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3801.687s">So</a> I'm going to be posting the agenda online. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3804.749s">So</a> basically, we're only going to have an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3806.809s">Unfortunately,</a> that's all the time they could give us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3808.79s">But</a> the primary issue of the day is going to be discussing how we can reach out to our senior community to improve <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3817.033s">whether</a> it's through tutoring or maybe through RTI, whatever sort of implementation that we're able to have for the senior community to help out with our education system. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3827.139s">And</a> basically just to hear from what we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3830.081s">All</a> this will be posted officially though.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3840.066s">Yeah,</a> unfortunately.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4876.196s">I</a> think that it would be very useful for us as a committee to actually have something that's machine readable as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4881.037s">Just</a> having a PDF is not as useful as having something that is where the data can actually be read. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4889.711s">And</a> I also think it'd be great for us to have an easy way to visualize the budget, whether it's a pie chart people can click on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4895.872s">I'm</a> happy to do a lot of the visualization work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4898.513s">I</a> just need the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4899.913s">That's</a> machine readable, because I'm not going to data entry it all step by step.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4909.135s">Yeah,</a> then I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4910.195s">We</a> can do a lot of great stuff with that.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4970.68s">I</a> also started off with a school committee Facebook page for my firm. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4975.541s">We</a> can all talk about how we want to address that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4979.602s">But</a> if you ever want me to send you their digital copies, that's why I'm letting you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4985.043s">But</a> I don't, once again, it's not machine readable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4986.943s">So</a> if the PDFs could actually have the text on there, that would be my way.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5555.483s">Two</a> questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5556.304s">So</a> the first, I noticed the increase in van bus transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5560.606s">So</a> right now, you're making up the $5,000 as fundraising. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5564.968s">Is</a> that where that money is coming from right now?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5592.691s">Yeah,</a> and my second question involves the instructional supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5597.522s">Has</a> your department reached out to like Blick and Michael's Arts and Crafts to see if we could get a grant from them to get some art supplies?

 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7073.109s">Thank</a> you for the clarification.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7357.724s">I'm</a> certainly, I think this is important that we do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7360.245s">I</a> would just like to have a report that we can have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7363.447s">So</a> I'd like to know how much money we generate from these rentals, how large the groups are. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7368.669s">I</a> think that I would like to suggest that we have a committee of the whole meeting with just this particular issue is discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7374.772s">We</a> have all the paperwork before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7376.393s">We</a> can have the research. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7377.835s">But</a> for me, I need to know what are the groups that are currently renting, how much income we receive from these groups, and the size of every one of these groups, whether it's the Impact Church, how many members they usually receive on what days.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7407.311s">There's</a> a senior group at the pool, right?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7691.101s">So</a> we have to be fair and equitable about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7697.303s">Least</a> detail until this issue is resolved.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7719.935s">Mayor</a> Burke, I mean, I definitely have sympathy with the church and this is partly their home as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7725.396s">Um,</a> so I, if that is acceptable to church, that's definitely acceptable to me until we can talk about this issue in more detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7731.798s">So</a> I'd like to add in addition to my motion to make sure that we have police details until the committee of the whole can meet for this weekend to make sure they're responsible for at least two details.<h2><a href="../2018-02-28_9sQ1QM-0eSg/2018-02-28_9sQ1QM-0eSg.html">Medford School Committee 02/27/18</a></h2>

 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=958.351s">Yeah,</a> I noticed the price increase for electricity from a little over $0.08 to $0.09. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=966.415s">I</a> wanted to know, have we ever looked into getting solar panels for the school, or how much that would lower the cost?

 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4017.295s">How</a> many students do we have right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4019.196s">They're</a> at the Minuteman for the plumbing program? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4020.777s">Is</a> that correct?

 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5277.906s">Oh,</a> excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5278.447s">I'll</a> speak a little louder. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5280.288s">This</a> statement will not change any minds. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5283.069s">Those</a> that know me in my commitment to transparency already know my work ethic. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5288.492s">For</a> the rest, I shall try my best to open my heart and write as honestly as I can about this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5295.936s">Words</a> matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5297.457s">I've</a> spent the past few weeks meditating on the words I've settled upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5301.639s">I've</a> prayed to help me see any terrible mistake that I might have made. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5306.561s">I've</a> spent sleepless nights rereading the article in the transcript and my quotes in them and searching my motivations. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5315.545s">While</a> I now have access to more means of dealing with these situations in the future as a school committee member, <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5326.209s">As</a> a private citizen from the bottom of my heart, I really, I regret nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5331.692s">Here's</a> why. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5333.573s">I</a> want to live in a city where every resident is free to challenge those in positions of power, even me. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5341.237s">It</a> may seem like a silly thing to believe that a treasurer or a president of a PTG occupies a position of power, but they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5349.678s">Every</a> group that works inside of our schools and inside of our city government occupies a position of power. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5356.841s">As</a> a candidate, I came across a $6,092 mistake that many, many people did not know about. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5365.826s">While</a> I appreciate the treasurer's statement that she made the community aware, it seems that the issue is buried. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5375.21s">In</a> my opinion, <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5378.333s">This</a> mistake should have been reported to the parents of Medford in 2014 when it happened, and not just maybe a small group of members of the PTG, but to the wider community at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5390.976s">To</a> my knowledge, neither Roy Belson nor many, many of the other parents knew about their losses of their donations. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5395.977s">So</a> after great deliberation with many of the parents involved, thinking about what kind of example we wanted to set our children, we decided to report the Ed Rarer to the people of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5407.785s">I</a> never once labeled any member of the McGlynn PTG a crook or a criminal or a monster. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5417.347s">As</a> a matter of fact, I never mentioned any names in any of the correspondence that we had in the transcript. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5427.689s">In</a> my heart, I knew that hard-earned money was wasted, and the people of Medford deserve to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5433.31s">So</a> we called for transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5437.621s">To</a> the undecided in this room, I ask you, did you elect me to stay silent when I found evidence that money was wasted? <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5444.045s">Would</a> you have preferred that I stand mute? <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5449.287s">If</a> I find evidence that our schools have not used money properly, I'm going to speak up. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5455.671s">I</a> serve at your pleasure, but I forever stand as a fierce defender of the values I cherish and the city I love. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5462.674s">The</a> treasurer and the president of McGlynn PTG seem convinced that they run a tight ship. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5468.499s">God</a> bless them. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5469.559s">They</a> have worked very hard, and I appreciate all the time they have invested. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5474.283s">But</a> here are the facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5476.465s">The</a> laws of their group demand they present financial information when asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5480.648s">They</a> didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5482.129s">The</a> laws of their group demand they keep their rules and their ledgers handy at every meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5488.895s">Didn't</a> happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5490.467s">Their</a> rules require a budget at the beginning of the year, but it wasn't provided. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5495.209s">Mothers</a> felt belittled and humiliated. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5498.07s">How</a> dare parents ask questions, eh? <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5501.151s">I</a> have no doubt that every single parent at the McGlynn PTG loved the children and want to help our city grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5509.454s">Nonetheless,</a> you can't play fast and loose with the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5514.183s">You</a> would think that after stumbling into such a chasm with the IRS, people would be a little more cautious. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5519.768s">Those</a> are the facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5522.47s">But</a> before you go, I think it's really time we can move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5526.713s">There's</a> a great proposal on the table here. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5530.036s">Parents</a> will have financial information now when they're asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5532.858s">Our</a> school committees will work to help parent groups become as effective as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5538.002s">Training</a> will be provided. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5539.944s">Never</a> again will thousands of dollars be lost into a hole. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5544.804s">I</a> think this is an exciting time and I think we have a great proposal here. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5548.566s">And</a> I hope everyone, both sides of this issue, look forward to moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5554.509s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=5673.817s">Do</a> you want to say something?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6001.367s">I'm</a> going to respond briefly.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6979.304s">Can</a> we move that issue to the Community Relations Subcommittee? <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6982.606s">Because</a> a number of people have talked to me about how can we publicize our policies more effectively in conjunction with our own services?<h2><a href="../2017-12-05_XE9EudnPjZw/2017-12-05_XE9EudnPjZw.html">Medford School Committee meeting December 4, 2017</a></h2>

 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3527.07s">Friends</a> and neighbors, my name is Michael Leggero, and I'm running for school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3531.592s">Let</a> me tell you why. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3533.297s">Somewhere</a> in Medford, a baby was born. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3535.679s">Lovely,</a> curious, and if anything like my pumpkins, a bit of a troublemaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3540.702s">Soon</a> this beautiful child will be entering kindergarten with my son, Kason. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3545.665s">Until</a> I had a child, I could only see the rough outline of responsibility drawn by fatherhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3552.109s">Yet</a> being a parent has opened my eyes beyond the circle of my own family. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3556.631s">As</a> a math teacher with over seven years experience, I know education is destiny. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3563.743s">Every</a> kindergartner's future is shaped by the parents and administrators and teachers standing in front of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3569.847s">It</a> is an awesome responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3572.029s">The</a> parents of Medford invest in our school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3574.891s">It</a> is your responsibility to elect the

href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3584.574s">But</a> before I jabber on about myself, let's talk about our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3588.535s">The</a> Mustangs make our city proud, but is it too outrageous to imagine our schools as the best in Massachusetts? <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3597.558s">In</a> the 80s, Medford was placed at the top of almost every school ranking in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3603.22s">People</a> traveled the world to visit our schools, believe it or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3607.821s">Now,</a> well, we've fallen into the middle of the pack. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3611.235s">U.S.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3611.495s">News</a> and World Report ranks Arlington 12th, Somerville 69th, Everett 89th in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3620.862s">Medford,</a> we didn't even crack into the top 100. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3624.724s">Great</a> Schools, it's an online website, ranks our district 5 out of 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3631.429s">Boston</a> Magazine recently ranked Medford 89 out of 125 Boston-area schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3637.885s">Our</a> four-year graduation rate has fallen from 87% a few years ago to 80% now. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3645.09s">These</a> rankings

href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3657.719s">Let's</a> play as hard as our musk gangs fight. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3661.562s">Let's</a> be the best school in America. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3665.229s">My</a> teaching career has stretched from Philadelphia to Shanghai. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3669.914s">I</a> have experience teaching mathematics at both elite universities and highly ranked public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3676.44s">I</a> helped build a successful math team in Houston, and I hope you give me the opportunity to fortify the schools here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3683.313s">Currently,</a> I run an organic blueberry farm in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3687.176s">As</a> a small business owner, I know how to stretch a buck. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3690.238s">I</a> know that throwing money at a problem will not solve poor planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3694.741s">Customers</a> demand responsive business. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3697.283s">I</a> hope to add this type of responsiveness to our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3701.246s">Here's</a> some plans to help us move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3703.908s">Because</a> Henry won't give me 10 minutes, I only have time for four. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3706.97s">First,</a> we need to make our school committee more accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3710.637s">As</a> a parent of two little boys, I can tell you from personal experience that 6.30 on a weekday is a tough time to make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3719.021s">What</a> I suggest is that we rotate our school committee meetings into the weekends, at least once a month, and provide parents with some entertainment for their kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3728.886s">This</a> way, excited kids and tired parents will have an opportunity to speak about what's going on with our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3736.3s">Let's</a> extend relationships with the local universities. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3739.302s">Right</a> now we have a really great relationship with Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3742.084s">Let's</a> look to schools like MIT and Harvard and open internship and lecture opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3748.347s">Third,</a> we need to reduce the disparities between the schools here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3753.851s">The</a> Andrews and the McGlynn, for example, it is unacceptable that poverty rates at one school is half the poverty rate at the other school. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3761.756s">We</a> need to make sure that parity is achieved. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3765.235s">Fourth,</a> let's improve relationships with parents of special needs children. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3770.099s">By</a> far the biggest complaint that I hear as I've been knocking on doors among parents is the resistance to individual education plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3778.285s">As</a> a teacher, I acted as a liaison between parents and administrators. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3782.968s">I</a> will continue this work on our school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3786.731s">My</a> campaign is about creating the most successful and transparent school district in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3792.967s">If</a> you have some time, check out my website, takegovernment.com, or call me directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3797.97s">My</a> home number is 781-866-2191. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3801.832s">I'm</a> always happy to talk, hopefully after my boys are in bed. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3806.475s">The</a>

 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6056.637s">It's</a> possible that there was a miscommunication. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6058.919s">I'll</a> talk to the parent and see if we can forward that information to you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6062.822s">But</a> it was that exact issue that she could walk it, but now she can't walk and she was very frustrated at the response she received from the school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6071.129s">I'm</a> sure it was just a miscommunication.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6115.941s">Yeah,</a> it's not that, I don't think there was any malfeasance or practice on anyone's part, it was just a question of miscommunication. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6122.363s">And</a> I just wanted to get a sense of how often that happens for parents, because as well, many parents don't think that they do have a choice, at least in my experience when talking to them.

 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=242.079s">But</a> in addition to the estimate, I'd like to suggest that we send this issue to Building and Grounds for more research.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4476.282s">Would</a> you have preferred that I stand mute? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4481.52s">If</a> I find evidence that our schools have not used money properly, I'm going to speak up. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4487.91s">I</a> serve at your pleasure, but I forever stand as a fierce defender of the values I cherish and the city I love. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4494.876s">The</a> treasurer and the president of McGlynn PTG seem convinced that they run a tight ship. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4500.721s">God</a> bless them. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4501.782s">They</a> have worked very hard, and I appreciate all the time they have invested. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4506.506s">But</a> here are the facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4508.688s">The</a> laws of their group demand they present financial information when asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4512.872s">They</a> didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4514.333s">The</a> laws of their group demand they keep their rules and their ledgers handy at every meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4521.099s">Didn't</a> happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4522.692s">Their</a> rules require a budget at the beginning of the year, but it wasn't provided. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4527.417s">Mothers</a> felt belittled and humiliated. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4530.3s">How</a> dare parents ask questions, eh? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4533.374s">I</a> have no doubt that every single parent at the McGlynn PTG loved the children and want to help our city grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4541.657s">Nonetheless,</a> you can't play fast and loose with the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4546.378s">You</a> would think that after stumbling into such a chasm with the IRS, people would be a little more cautious. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4551.98s">Those</a> are the facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4554.681s">But</a> before you go, I think it's really time we can move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4558.922s">There's</a> a great proposal on the table here. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4562.243s">Parents</a> will have financial information now when they're asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4565.064s">Our</a> school committees will work to help parent groups become as effective as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4570.186s">Training</a> will be provided. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4572.146s">Never</a> again will thousands of dollars be lost into a hole. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4577.028s">I</a> think this is an exciting time and I think we have a great proposal here. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4580.807s">And</a> I hope everyone on both sides of this issue look forward to moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4586.671s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=3640.973s">I</a> just want to respond to that question about the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=3643.594s">Many</a> cities, most cities actually in Massachusetts, have regular charter reviews in their process. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=3647.676s">It's</a> built in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=3648.717s">I</a> can assure you, Councilor Knight, that we're going to keep collecting signatures. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=3652.259s">We</a> will reach our 6,000 signatures. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=3654.0s">There's</a> no question about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=3655.421s">We're</a> not asking for the City of Medford to automatically accept these changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=3660.504s">This</a> would be an elected body, and any changes that they make would have to be approved by the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=3666.488s">trying</a> to hold a gun to the city of Medford's head and ask for a ransom of some ridiculous amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=3672.331s">We</a> will get these 6,000 signatures. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=3674.052s">Councilor</a> Marks presents this Home Rule petition to make the process of charter review as inclusive as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=3680.915s">He</a> wants to involve every level of our government to move this charter review forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=3686.417s">Our</a> group could do it alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=3687.258s">We</a> can keep gathering signatures. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=3689.679s">We</a> could force City Hall to accept a review. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=3693.26s">But</a> wouldn't it be healthier if everyone in our city was involved in this change, from city council to the mayor's office to all the people in our city? <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=3701.104s">A</a> vote against this petition tonight is a vote against this type of reclusiveness. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=3706.447s">All</a> I ask is for everyone not to pretend. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=3708.528s">If</a> you're against charter review, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=3710.048s">That's</a> your right as a citizen of Medford, and I respect that view. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=3713.864s">But</a> just state your position honestly. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=3715.905s">It's</a> one thing to say I'm for something and then not do anything to help the process along.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_acqgxK4yhEM/2025-03-21_acqgxK4yhEM.html">Medford, MA City Council - Feb. 16, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

<a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=3292.758s">For</a> years, the library has been continuously underfunded by the city administration, the victim of numerous budget cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=3303.647s">Things</a> became so lean in 2012 that Medford needed a special waiver from the state to maintain certification despite not meeting basic funding standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=3315.175s">For</a> six years, this process continued. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=3319.462s">And</a> even though members of the city came to petition city council for help about this issue, and city council continuously voted on improving the situation at the library, nothing was done. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=3330.865s">The</a> charter, which is the constitution for Medford, as Councilor Marks says, allows the city administration unilateral decisions about funding measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=3341.967s">So,</a> even though all of this issue came up, nothing got done. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=3346.99s">The</a> issue became so bad that the state actually threatened to pull certification from the library system in Medford, and thankfully, through one last sort of 11th hour measure, a number of residents raised their voice and the city administration finally decided to act. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=3365.222s">We</a> have a new mayor now, and that's good news. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=3368.064s">Many</a> people are excited about the opportunity of addressing many of the crumbling buildings throughout our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=3374.868s">But</a> nonetheless, even on the campaign trail, Mayor Burke supported this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=3379.791s">Both</a> candidates did. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=3382.132s">While</a> I was campaigning, we collected over 1,500 signatures, which is where we're at. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=3386.915s">We're</a> a little over 1,500 signatures for charter review right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=3390.907s">My</a> group discussed this compromise measure tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=3393.95s">Overall,</a> we think it's pretty good. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=3396.032s">A</a> number of members of the group want to discuss clarifications and maybe some reservations about some ideas here. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=3403.478s">But</a> I want to talk about this in more broad strokes. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=3407.281s">1986,</a> a lot has happened since the days of Hulk Hogan. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=3410.524s">I</a> don't know if you guys remember, but Halley's Comet visited us in 1986. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=3416.569s">It's</a> going to be visiting us again in 2076. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=3419.431s">I</a> seriously hope that we can get this issue fast-tracked. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=3423.074s">There</a> is a number of people that are excited to add their voice to this process, and I thank you so much for bringing this issue up to us.

<a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5787.0s">That's</a> a very vague term of what's going to be improved. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5790.283s">So</a> I think there needs to be a point-by-point analysis on why Medford needs this plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5796.689s">The</a> $74 million price tag will be covered by rate payers. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5801.902s">And</a> it's disappointing that this price tag has not been included in this presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5806.765s">Understandably,</a> they didn't want to perhaps spook people, but I think it's an important element knowing that we're going to be paying for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5814.309s">And</a> as was mentioned at the conversation, there was a lot of concerns about traffic and environmental impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5823.295s">And</a> unfortunately, while once again, you know, I understand you all are very busy, <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5827.532s">it</a> would have been good to actually see more information about what is the environmental impact of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5832.915s">It's</a> going to have an impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5834.615s">Now,</a> I'm sure Eversource will do the best it can to minimize that impact, but it will have an impact on our roads and our environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5841.939s">So</a> how is that going to be mitigated? <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5844.2s">Currently,</a> there is a multi-prong evidentiary process that's going on right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5850.954s">Currently</a> there's 28 pages of unanswered questions that various citizens have asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5856.657s">The</a> city of Somerville is in fact an intervener on the process, not an intervener, they're a step below intervener, but they're engaging in this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5865.102s">I</a> would encourage everyone on this council to engage with it more as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5869.004s">If</a> you would like to view the 28 pages of questions or any of the documents that I have access to being an intervener in this project, <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5876.216s">please</a> call me at any time. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5877.657s">I'm</a> more than happy to furnish that information, as I'm sure Eversource is as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5884.059s">At</a> the meeting, I asked four main questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5887.64s">And</a> one of the big questions I would like to hear answered, and it's in this 28 pages of questions that Eversource has to respond to, is basically, why is this necessary? <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5898.243s">With</a> improvements in alternative energy sources, from solar to wind, <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5903.199s">Why</a> is it that we need to build basically another pipeline? <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5905.84s">Because</a> that's what this is. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5907.201s">It's</a> a pipeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5908.181s">Now,</a> of course, electricity is going through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5910.662s">But</a> are there other options? <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5912.463s">I'm</a> sure Eversource will do the best they can answering their questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5915.905s">Currently,</a> the way I stand on this whole process is I'm not really sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5920.707s">Maybe</a> it is the best thing for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5922.608s">Maybe</a> it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5923.828s">But</a> they are required by law to provide an alternative strategy for this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5930.151s">Now,</a> Eversource, as of right now, have provided <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5933.071s">an</a> alternative pipeline, another much longer road that would tear up many more streets than the current preferred plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5942.778s">But</a> this is sort of a false choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5944.879s">It's</a> like going to a diner and there's two choices on the menu, scrambled eggs or eggs sunny side up. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5950.143s">It's</a> still eggs, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5951.644s">So</a> what I really hope to see from Eversource is why other options will not solve these problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5957.809s">And</a> as of right now, I mean, because they're working with the interveners to answer these questions, <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5962.815s">They</a> haven't presented many of these answers yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5965.336s">So</a> I think it's important that we remind ourselves that this is a big project, and it is not finalized yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5971.639s">Eversource</a> has many different hurdles to overcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5974.62s">But</a> here's what we do know. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5976.261s">The</a> process will be expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5978.922s">It</a> will have an impact on our society. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5981.544s">I</a> would encourage everyone to think seriously about this process that's going to cost us
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5987.453s">Now,</a> maybe, as the gentleman said, this is part of another sort of project that will help New England immensely. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=5996.777s">But</a> I think we need to consider these ramifications very seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6000.518s">If</a> anyone at home is interested in receiving any of the documents I have mentioned, please call me any time at 844-TAKE-GVT. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6012.763s">Thank</a> you very much for allowing me to speak, and thank you very much for Eversource for coming down. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6017.783s">Sure,</a> my number, once again, is 844-TAKE-GVT. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6025.95s">So,</a> TAKE-GVT. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6028.152s">Please,</a> I'm more than happy, you can also email me anytime at mr.takegovernment.com. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6034.658s">I</a> have access to hundreds of pages of documents, and I'm slowly sort of filtering my way through.

 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3019.371s">With</a> all due respect to the Councilor, the fact that 80% of the businesses in Medford are losing business should be his concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3026.652s">And</a> he can make an easy recommendation.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3060.762s">Beyond</a> these two points, in this perhaps squabbling environment, going to these traffic, listening to this conversation about traffic over and over again, I'm reminded about those cartoons with Wile E.

All these commissioners are going to be appointed by the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4177.252s">This</a> might work out great now that we have a current mayor that works collegiately with these groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4183.825s">However,</a> this might not always be the case in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4187.446s">I</a> suggest that these members are elected directly from the community gardeners themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4194.729s">I</a> understand that one person might need to be brought in from the mayor's office to make sure that there is a line of communication between the mayor's office and these groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4206.314s">But</a> I think it is a mistake to have all five commissioners directly appointed by the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4213.975s">would</a> be that perhaps there would be in the future a mayor who is not as interested in community gardening as this current administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4221.541s">So</a> I urge that you consider that four of these members are elected at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4225.824s">I've</a> taken a brief sample of the members here. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4228.846s">They</a> do support this idea as of my conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4231.668s">Do</a> you not support? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4234.78s">Oh,</a> you don't like the idea that you elect people directly? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4237.102s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4245.948s">You</a> think that's enough, the three? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4251.993s">I'm</a> confused because I just spoke with the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4255.495s">Perhaps</a> there's a miscommunication on my end. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4257.157s">If</a> there is, I withdraw any sort of objection. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4260.099s">The</a> solicitor said that these five people are <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4263.802s">appointed</a> by the mayor as of now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4265.342s">Is</a> that correct or not?

 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4347.815s">Fair</a> and open means that the people of the garden control the commissioners that apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4353.297s">As</a> of right now, unamended, these five commissioners will be appointed directly by the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4359.719s">That</a> is something that we need to consider if there is a mayor that comes in later who is not as excited about this community garden commission.

 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6495.171s">May</a> I ask a quick question? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6496.272s">On</a> the paper now, is there a recommendation to hire a traffic engineer? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6504.938s">So</a> there is. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6506.159s">Can</a> we put it on the paper now? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6508.06s">Because</a> at the budget meeting I was there, and I don't recall that motion coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6513.084s">Oh,</a> was it a different budget meeting?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6529.653s">The</a> traffic commission is not really solving these problems right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6532.795s">I</a> think there needs to be an individual that has control of these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6537.217s">Every</a> single street I've walked down in Medford has these problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6541.273s">There</a> needs to be one individual who's ultimately responsible for these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6544.314s">Madam</a> Vice President.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6582.111s">Or</a> transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6583.624s">I</a> don't know if it's fair to many of the individuals that took time out of their schedule to attend a variety of different meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6589.85s">While</a> I understand that there is this issue to you want to explore different options, I hope that we can understand that many people came out today about this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6600.919s">We</a> don't have enough civil engineers on the Medford staff as Councilor Penta pointed out. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6605.84s">Having</a> someone that actually studied transportation here directly in Medford, I think, would alleviate many of these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6611.482s">You're</a> right, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6613.363s">He</a> would make recommendations, and these recommendations might actually cost more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6617.564s">But</a> these would be recommendations that would be needed throughout the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6620.385s">They</a> wouldn't be squandering.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6729.503s">A</a> very disappointing fact in our city that when a paper is sent to the executive office, it is just, as you say, collects dust. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6737.827s">That's</a> unacceptable.

 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5484.796s">I</a> understand that there was a meeting, but unfortunately, because it was exactly the same time, I had to decide if I wanted to participate in the transfers versus Rights Pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5493.06s">I</a> think both issues are important, but I thought the transfers being a million dollars would be something I should participate in.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5507.808s">I</a> believe the body could perhaps make a recommendation to the Parks Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5511.412s">to</a> provide 100 or 200 passes to families in financial need. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5516.253s">I</a> don't think that's such a difficult question to ask.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5577.848s">My</a> concern is that because we're so close to the season, people buying tickets and buying passes, that maybe even if there is a change for next year, perhaps we could lower the rate again. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5587.194s">But</a> for this year, providing 100 passes seems like a very minimal thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sB_5XTIqkQk&t=5590.797s">And</a> I think it would help a lot of families.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_JknWFpZeyhQ/2025-03-21_JknWFpZeyhQ.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 9, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3957.721s">So</a> there are two flavors. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3959.402s">One,</a> if this board decides to create a commission under two-thirds vote, that commission will not have the ability to answer certain questions and will not be able to even advise about term limits or other issues like changing the mayor or significant changes to the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3981.018s">An</a> elected board, however, will have the capacity to make significant changes to the charter or actually recommend them. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3988.368s">In</a> this capacity, I would recommend that we try to move forward to creating an elected commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3993.992s">So</a> there will be a vote on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3995.934s">Would</a> you like to review the charter, yes or no? <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=3998.295s">And</a> then people will vote for a number of elected people that will actually be on this position. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4003.979s">That</a> is the direction that we should go and I hope we have an opportunity to come to that conclusion.

 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2610.363s">My</a> name is Michael Ruggiero. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2611.624s">I</a> live on 18 Pembroke Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2614.385s">My</a> first suggestion is I'm also frustrated by the carnival being here and the lack of parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2621.529s">May</a> I suggest that the city provides a shuttle that ferries people from Riverside, the parking lot on Riverside, which would be available at 6 o'clock, to this building? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2631.514s">There</a> are numerous different agencies that would be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2634.595s">So</a> perhaps that would be an option, rather than having people hunt for parking all across town. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2639.294s">My</a> second suggestion involves the wording of the resolution, and it involves the word, I think you should involve the word breach, due to breach of contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2647.996s">The</a> reason why I suggest this is that there's numerous places in the contract where you can terminate, but those terminations also have some consequences for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2656.719s">Well,</a> let me read you off this particular section. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2658.459s">It's</a> off page 15 of the contract, section 23. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2661.94s">In</a> addition to other termination rights here under, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2665.494s">with</a> party may terminate this agreement upon breach by the other party of any covenant, term, or condition wherein provided the breaking party first releases written notice, which you have in multiple resolutions, of such breach and fails to remedy same within 10 days if a monetary breach or 30 days if a non-monetary breach. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2687.065s">After</a> receipt of written notice thereof and any breaching party fails to commerce <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2692.568s">remedying</a> such non-monetary breach within said 30 days, period, if such breach cannot be reasonably remedied within 30 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2700.23s">That's</a> a lot of lawyer speak, but the idea is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2703.251s">If</a> they've broken the contract, which they have seemed to on multiple accounts, some of which you all have pointed out, some of which I've handed to Councilor Penta and highlighted points, they haven't responded within 30 days, they haven't remedied these points, they're under breach of contract, there are no consequences for canceling this contract under the city.
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2771.586s">So</a> in conclusion, I think you should, due to breach of contract, those words might sound trivial and maybe legalistic, but if a judge <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2782.543s">agrees</a> that Republic is under breach of the contract, there are no serious consequences for the city, where if you just cancel, there may be some consequences. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2790.828s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_Fp6eVDpxW8g/2025-03-21_Fp6eVDpxW8g.html">Medford City Council - April 14, 2015</a></h2>

President, my name is Michael or Jiro. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8968.983s">I</a> live on 18 Pembroke Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8970.843s">I</a> have two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8971.984s">The</a> first is With the license plate information that has been aggregated by Republic parking Is that information being sold to private people as a big data enterprise or what happens to that data? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8984.048s">Does</a> anyone know?
 <p>[Michael Ruggiero]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8993.175s">Oh,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8993.996s">My</a> second point is I've been volunteering at the senior center, and a number of seniors have expressed confusion over how to input <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9003.665s">you</a> know, their license plate and pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9005.446s">Maybe</a> it would be helpful if someone from Republic Parking would go down there and give a lecture. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9010.247s">Some</a> of these individuals have trouble, you know, putting in emergency contact numbers into their phones. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9014.248s">They're</a> not particularly tech savvy.
