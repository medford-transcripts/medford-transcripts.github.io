 <p>[Christopher D'Aveta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1951.358s">Good</a> evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1952.018s">Uh,</a> Chris Davido, 67 West street. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1954.679s">Um,</a> the person who spoke a couple of people before me basically said what I was going to say, which is the, the narrowing of that roadway is really the only way to properly slow cars down because, um, and especially for people trying to cross at the crosswalks where we've all traveled that road, we know you can't really see the person as you're traveling the roadway. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1980.127s">It's</a> wide enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1981.621s">so</a> that it's out of your peripheral, it's in your peripheral vision, just at the edge. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1987.862s">And</a> if you try to, of course, edge out onto the roadway between cars, even when there's no parking at the bus stop there, you're kind of blocked coming down High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=2002.425s">I</a> did wanna say that, and maybe I missed this earlier, got here a little late, is that there seems to be no signal <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=2010.993s">on</a> all of High Street until you get to Medford Square, essentially. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=2017.837s">There</a> are two pedestrian signals, one at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=2021.279s">Ray's</a> and one at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=2023.42s">Joe's</a> in front of the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=2026.302s">But</a> I don't think there's any signal until Medford Square there, essentially. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=2031.565s">So</a> that whole stretch of High Street, people kind of see as a way to go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=2038.149s">Of</a> course, the railroad signal. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=2040.979s">So</a> I just want to emphasize that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=2042.641s">And</a> this is not a new issue in a way because some of us parents had been working with the prior administration on getting a traffic calming measure there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=2054.21s">And</a> those speed sensors you see now are the result of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=2062.017s">Mayor</a> McClain put those in. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=2064.439s">I</a> think one is functional and one is not at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=2069.938s">Those</a> are part of the solution, but not the complete solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=2073.921s">Obviously,</a> we need to slow traffic down to prevent what happened about a year ago, which is a truck driving up onto someone's lawn, traveling too fast, trying to avoid a collision. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=2087.25s">That</a> could have been a deadly accident. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=2089.851s">Luckily,</a> no one was hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=2092.733s">So</a> that's all I want to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=2094.735s">Thank</a> you.
