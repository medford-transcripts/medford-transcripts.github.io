<a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5227.304s">Who</a> did they speak to? <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5229.867s">I</a> was really confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5231.488s">And</a> I just want to set it clear that the school committee did not have any meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5236.473s">We</a> were not talking about raising our salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5239.096s">And</a> I'm talking from my own personal opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5241.017s">Nobody's</a> reached out to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5242.839s">It</a> was not a thought in my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5244.32s">I</a> was surprised and confused and disheartened by the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5250.042s">It</a> was just something that we're not expecting. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5253.884s">And</a> I did hear, I got into the meeting late, but I did hear <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5259.326s">Rick</a> Caraviello, Councilor Caraviello mentioned that a pay cut in their salaries to make the salaries equal. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5267.19s">You</a> know, I think that would be the best way to make the salaries equal across the two different, you know, boards between the school committee and the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5278.517s">If</a> there's going to be any changes, then maybe a decrease in the salary to bring the councilor salary back down to the school committee salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5287.822s">Okay,</a> so I got my point across and I wasn't prepared and ready to speak, but I just hope that I made it clear that I object to this resolution and I hope and I pray that it does not pass tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5304.907s">And</a> thank you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=5306.488s">Thank</a> you, everybody.<h2><a href="../2023-10-12_95wursjg8MQ/2023-10-12_95wursjg8MQ.html">MSC Family & Community Engagement Subcommittee - 10.11.2023</a></h2>

It's tough because then we're going to get into too many indicators. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1987.54s">But</a> they're both important. <a href="https://youtu.be/e2JGoC251eM&t=1989.401s">It's</a> very, it's very tricky to narrow it down.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1400.196s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1401.157s">Maintaining</a> a learning environment built upon the pillars of safety, equity, and consistency. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1406.742s">The</a> score was 3.77. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1407.542s">There</a> has been some progress and we have much work to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1412.387s">Equity</a> is perhaps our biggest need to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1415.189s">Creating</a> a strategic plan or goal around just this issue would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1419.753s">Defining</a> equity would be a good start.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2418.768s">I</a> can take standard two.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2648.326s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2648.746s">Okay,</a> so I'll start on standard two, management and operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2656.313s">The</a> score was 3.15. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2658.895s">There</a> is feedback under several of the sections under standard two. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2663.258s">So</a> I'll read the feedback for standard two, and then I'll, you know, continue on with the score for each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2671.764s">subset</a> and read the comments for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2674.004s">So</a> standard two management operations 3.15. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2677.805s">The</a> changes to the budget this year were effective and efficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2681.446s">The</a> committee was able to get a comprehensive view of the priorities and discuss in a positive and productive manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2687.807s">The</a> state of the district system is poor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2690.087s">By</a> systems, I'm referring to processes, technology, and people that comprise the foundation and infrastructure on which the district runs. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2698.889s">There</a> needs to be people <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2700.789s">There</a> needs to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2701.59s">I'm</a> sorry I'm just missing my spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2704.474s">There</a> needs to be considerable focus, moving forward and prioritize a well run set of administrative functions without improvements on the administrative side of the house, the districts continued improvement in curriculum, <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2716.708s">and</a> instruction will be limited compliance with school committee policy is low. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2721.31s">And</a> in the case of out of out of school suspension policy inadequate. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2725.392s">The</a> committee proactively provided an extensive amount of planning time as the administration to come back to us with any changes that they felt would be needed to operate operationalize the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2736.598s">and</a> to articulate what financial supports are needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2739.78s">None</a> of this occurred. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2741.32s">Students</a> appear to be regularly suspended this year, which is complete conflict with the policy set forward by the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2748.284s">As</a> another example, the committee also adopted policy that outlines regular reports, and went throughout the school year, we expect to receive them. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2756.628s">There</a> has been no acknowledgement of or accounting for those reports this academic year. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2763.444s">2.1</a> environment the score was 2.97. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2767.086s">We</a> are beginning to evaluate operational systems in a district that has long been without. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2773.072s">The</a> next one was 2.2 2.2 human resources management and development score was 3.24 a standard report of other school committee committees receives is the personnel report continuing hires termination leaves of absence workers conversation and other positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2792.541s">This</a> report is invaluable for understanding the state of the organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2797.203s">This</a> report is received monthly, or more often other districts, while it is understood that due to disconnected software systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2805.268s">This</a> report cannot be generated without substantial work effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2809.191s">And</a> that's we have not pressed for this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2811.672s">There</a> does not seem to be a plan to replace this disconnect software system, so that the administration can begin providing this critical report. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2819.677s">This</a> report is more than nice to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2821.998s">It</a> is considered mandatory and members of other school committees are shocked we don't get this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2827.419s">Identifying</a> a path forward to replace the software systems or connect them or merely to fund some kind of a project to make these reports easily generated is something we would like to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2837.582s">So</a> this is critical report can be generated and supplied to the committee is something we hope we can start in the coming year or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2846.343s">Then</a> we have 2.3 scheduling and management information systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2851.293s">The</a> score was 2.84. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2853.867s">There</a> are still multiple calendars throughout the member public school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2857.53s">These</a> multiple calendaring systems, which do not speak to each other result in predictable failures, such as double booking of spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2865.276s">This</a> issue has risen to the forefront numerous times. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2868.658s">The</a> committee has made clear our desire for a single calendaring system, or at least some of the operationalized method to ensure the problems of the multiple sources of truth is resolved and to improve transparency about who was using our space <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2883.441s">and</a> for non-NPS affiliated groups, what they are paying for the space. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2889.183s">And</a> law ethics, 2.4, law ethics and policies, the score was 3.11. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2895.225s">2.5</a> fiscal systems, the score was 3.56. <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2901.306s">And</a> the overall score overall was 3.15 for standard two management and operations.<h2><a

B was recommends ESSER. <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=2965.464s">Maybe</a> I wrote that down wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=2966.865s">And</a> then C was definitely ESSER. <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=2969.666s">So</a> I think I need some clarification on in regards to category B, where that is part of Mr. Russo's motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=2979.212s">So</a> is category B, is that <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=2983.435s">a</a> recommended ESSER or that's not, I get a little confused between the highest priority ESSER, the high priority ESSER, like why is C nodding? <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=2997.164s">Like</a> why are we counting on ESSER for all of the C priority needs and not for the category B? <a href="https://youtu.be/V6Avy5_u4Ug&t=3004.368s">I</a> guess I'm just getting confused about that.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=117.325s">Yes,</a> Mayor, I checked in with Mr. Russo the other week and we stopped at number 67. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=124.326s">I</a> need to go back because I think we moved too quickly in the first meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=127.467s">I</a> just have to bring something up about number 51 that I didn't get a chance to mention. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=132.728s">So</a> I wanted to just kind of go back to just review number 51 again, because I had notes and I never got a chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=139.909s">I</a> noted that I didn't get a chance to mention anything on number 51.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=248.337s">So</a> I originally in the prior meeting, I had notes listed here that it says, you know, regular meetings will begin at 630. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=256.123s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=257.243s">We</a> made that adjustment in the last meeting to correct it from another time that it had said no meetings at school <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=263.047s">committee</a> will go beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=264.628s">It</a> says 11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=266.049s">I</a> just have concerns about that for everybody who is in the school committee meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=272.174s">The</a> administrators, the students, the teachers, just everybody, the public watching. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=277.197s">I</a> think 11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=279.159s">is</a> just too late in the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=280.94s">We</a> start at 6 30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=282.461s">I</a> think it's more reasonable to have it go from like 6 30 to 9 30 and if there's a motion to recess <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=292.467s">Then</a> we should take a roll call, you know, is there a motion to recess, you know, and put everything on the table that we haven't covered, and then it gets put on the next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=301.51s">So</a> I, I have a motion to amend the time change from 11pm to 930pm. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=310.473s">And</a> the chair will then ask you know as we're getting close to 930pm. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=314.798s">If</a> there is a motion to recess or continue the meeting until an extended period of time is stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=320.784s">So</a> for example, like the chair would say, is there a motion to recess the meeting if we're not done. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=326.17s">If</a> we're close to being done, then you could maybe say, is there a motion to recess the meeting until like 10 p.m., you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=334.036s">And</a> we might get done before 10 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=336.077s">But</a> I just think going from 6.30 to 11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=340.981s">with</a> everybody's busy days and lives and having to be at school the next morning or work very early. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=346.365s">I</a> mean, I don't retain anything after 9 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=351.409s">It's</a> just gone.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=355.672s">Okay,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1029.865s">Yes,</a> and I'm going to keep my motion on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1032.686s">I</a> happen to, you know, understand and agree with the superintendent, I have to get up at 445am, and I am just exhausted by 930, and it's the next day. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1048.97s">It's</a> like I was on a boat or a plane. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1052.332s">I</a> can't get up. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1053.193s">I</a> can't think. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1054.433s">I</a> drink coffee. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1055.294s">It</a> just doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1057.295s">You</a> can't focus. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1058.155s">Even</a> the next day, you're affected by the very, very, very long day. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1063.698s">And</a> you can't drink coffee before the school committee meeting, because then I'll be up all night. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1068.861s">So</a> it's just I'm going to keep my motion on the floor, and I can hear from both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1073.684s">And</a> I just think that if we, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1077.566s">have</a> this time frame and we know that we're going later and there's important agenda items or there are people from the public just as i mentioned in the part of the motion that a motion can be made to extend the meeting until xx time and i think that would be reasonable for the administrators the school committee the public and just the students just everybody i'm just trying to make it <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1103.391s">equitable</a> for everybody, everybody has to get somewhere in the next morning, whether it's school, work, family, everybody's got to get up, you know, so I'm just trying to, you know, I've seen our meetings, they can carry on, we're doing much better. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1118.682s">And</a> sometimes there are items that take longer, but that's not typical. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1124.568s">Typical,</a> we do run to 930. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1127.191s">And</a> then there's always the occasional late meeting, which can happen with a controversial or very important topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1136.56s">So</a> we're not like, <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1139.704s">We're</a> not blocking it down to just 6.30 to 9.30, that's it, the meeting's over. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1144.427s">We're</a> still giving, as part of my motion, I'm still giving the offer to extend the meeting if a motion is made. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1151.192s">But</a> I won't talk, I let other people talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1153.654s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1198.965s">I</a> don't wanna withdraw the motion, but I'm thinking, I heard from Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1203.487s">Graham</a> and maybe we could make the alternative where we could start the meeting at six, we could end the meeting at 9.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1212.812s">So</a> that's the additional half hour so that we're not keeping the administrators past 9.30 unless there's an extension to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1221.556s">So</a> I'm making a motion now to change the start time to 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1226.218s">and</a> the end time to 9.30 p.m.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1237.449s">Right,</a> and I'm sorry, I meant to say the start time that she mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1242.35s">So</a> my motion, I'm going to change to, let me just get back. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1247.812s">I</a> just have to close the window to look at the words here, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1251.993s">So</a> I'm amending my original motion to read <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1258.369s">The</a> regular school committee will begin at 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1262.572s">No</a> meeting of the school committee will go beyond 9.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1267.156s">If</a> the school committee is still meeting at 9.30 p.m., the chair will ask, is there a motion to recess the meeting until a certain time? <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1275.022s">Or</a> is there a motion to extend the meeting beyond 9.30 in the evening and state the time so that everybody understands that there is an end time coming, whether it's going to be 10 or 10.30? <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1288.212s">Um,</a> a motion to continue the meeting requires the two thirds vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1291.354s">So</a> the time changes would be 6.00 PM to 9.30 PM second member.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1610.149s">What</a> about, I didn't withdraw my motion.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1618.791s">That</a> was the motion that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1620.651s">McLaughlin</a> seconded me on. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1621.751s">Gotcha.</a> 
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1769.315s">What</a> numbers are those?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=2409.647s">What</a> numbers are those? <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=2410.467s">I'm</a> sorry, Mayor, because I just have mine in a Google Drive, so I just have the numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=2414.588s">I</a> don't have pages. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=2415.249s">They're</a> different pages.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=2421.65s">Okay,</a> I'm just going through those numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=2426.212s">Yes,</a> so I do have some concerns about number 77. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=2434.785s">I</a> actually even reached out to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=2442.99s">So</a> it says all requests passed by the city council that pertain to member public schools will be sent to the school committee to be part of the next agenda in accordance with the school committee procedure and timing is found in addendum one, add item to agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=2456.925s">The</a> city clerk is authorized to add items to the school committee agenda, following our established procedure and add item to agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=2465.153s">The</a> school committee may refer such requests to the superintendent upon a majority vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=2469.977s">The</a> superintendent is not authorized to respond to city council request to attend city council meetings or perform any actions requested by the city council without a majority vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=2481.727s">I</a> was just reading this and, you know, it's just. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=2485.691s">You</a> know, the city council is another body. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=2489.074s">And</a> we have the add the item, add the agenda item instructions for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=2495.018s">So</a> we're going to give our instructions to the city clerk to add items to the school committee agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=2504.366s">I</a> just think, I don't think that is a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=2506.888s">I'm</a> not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=2508.609s">whether</a> I'm misunderstanding this, and then I wasn't sure, and it's not something that's currently being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=2514.512s">I</a> did, you know, ask about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=2517.873s">And</a> then where the superintendent is not authorized to respond or request to any email, you know, correspondence with city council, I feel it's too restrictive. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=2530.659s">And,</a> you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=2533.619s">I'm</a> just wondering if I could maybe hear from the superintendent on what her thoughts are on the way that this rule is written. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=2540.805s">I</a> really just don't really follow it.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3129.376s">I</a> will wait to hear from Member Ruseau and Member McLaughlin before I go. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3134.938s">I</a> just want to hear what everybody's thinking, and then I'll go at the end.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3412.377s">Yes,</a> so I still have some concerns about both parts of the way that this is written. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3420.081s">And</a> let me just, I'm sorry because I when I do click off I have to get back to it one moment I'm going to get back to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3425.584s">Okay,</a> it's over here now one second. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3427.785s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3429.646s">Um,</a> okay, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3431.957s">I've</a> been listening to everybody, and I was thinking about the first part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3436.76s">And</a> I, this is just what I'm thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3440.883s">Maybe</a> we could change it to say something like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3443.865s">All</a> motions passed by member city council that pertain to the member public schools will be sent by the president of the council to the school committee chair to, to be reviewed as an agenda <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3455.213s">to</a> review it as an agenda item seeking guidance from the committee in accordance with the school committee procedure and timing as found the addendum, you know, add item to agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3465.358s">And</a> that's something that the superintendent would then make that determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3469.741s">You</a> know, the mayor would then maybe forward it on to the superintendent and she can make the determination on, okay, let's get this added on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3476.865s">I</a> wanna seek the guidance from the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3479.526s">You</a> know, and that, you know, we would have some sort of a process where you're thinking about in the future we're going to have a lot of requests, maybe. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3486.776s">So</a> that could be part of it, you know, just a simpler plan for the rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3491.642s">And</a> then, you know, the second part. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3497.662s">You</a> know, I just, I don't understand why we have to include the majority vote of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3504.527s">So</a> if the superintendent receives a simple email, you know, oh, I just wanted to know, just checking in, you know, the vocational program is having, you know, this particular new equipment, you know, oh, did that get purchased, you know, something like that, just something simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3519.897s">I</a> feel as though she gets the email, she should be able to email back the city council without putting that on the agenda, so that we can take a full boat at the next school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3530.706s">So</a> I'm just thinking of it, just keeping it try to keep it a little simpler, where we just say, the superintendent is permitted to respond to, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3541.315s">reasonable,</a> I'm sorry, to city council reasonable requests to attend city council meetings or perform actions requested by the city council, you know, within reason, you know, and it's, you know, it might need a school, but it depends on like what the request is. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3559.823s">It</a> might be something that has to go on the agenda that we all have to make a vote on. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3564.945s">But,</a> you know, I think that the way that it's written right now, it's just, <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3570.767s">It's</a> just too restrictive. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3574.069s">Even</a> though I've heard from everybody and I still feel that it does insinuate that we are having problems with the city council and we are not. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3583.695s">And</a> I do think maybe in the future with a lot of things going on, with upgrades to the high school and body cameras on police officers, yes, we might have some requests but <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3595.501s">As</a> the superintendent mentioned, it's very rare. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3597.582s">And,</a> you know, I just think getting it on the agenda, you know, would be the best way to do it if it comes through from the city council president. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3607.345s">So</a> I'm just trying to really just simplify this rule and just, you know, kind of just make it a little bit simpler and friendlier.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3733.209s">Yeah,</a> and I'm trying to word it, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3736.191s">And</a> I'm working on it right now, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3738.452s">Graham,</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3740.153s">I'm</a> trying to put it all together with what the mayor just mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3745.156s">So</a> let me just reflect on what the mayor just mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3748.457s">She</a> mentioned that the current process, and I'm just trying to go through what she just said. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3752.92s">The</a> current process is that she will, if something was voted on the floor, <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3759.074s">So</a> let me just get this going. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3761.455s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3762.115s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3763.315s">All</a> motions passed by Medford city council that pertain to Medford public schools will be sent by city council president or city clerk to the school committee chair to be put on the, the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3783.577s">in</a> accordance with the procedure that we have in place.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3864.922s">Okay,</a> yes, thank you and I can just re reword it because I'm just doing this just from all the conversation and I'm trying the best here so okay so let me just see if I have this right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3875.866s">So,</a> I would make a motion to change number 77 to say all motions passed by the member city council that pertain to me for public schools will be sent by city council president to the school committee chair to be reviewed <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3891.466s">whether</a> or not it should be added as an agenda item. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3896.528s">And</a> I'm sorry, I'm just losing you because I wrote it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3899.89s">So</a> that's as far as I've retained. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3901.971s">That's</a> just my opinion, but I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3905.793s">I</a> agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3906.753s">I</a> think the way that it's working right now is working, but we don't have it documented. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3912.356s">So</a> I'm trying to get <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3914.637s">Number</a> 77 recorded the way it's working now, exactly the way it's working now. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3921.782s">That's</a> what I'm trying to do.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3927.407s">That's</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3927.987s">Yeah,</a> just simple, you know, and, and then like all this, all these rules, if we're having issues with any one of them at any point in the future, as we said already, we can bring this up on a regular school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3941.131s">We'd</a> like to change this. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3942.212s">Something's</a> not working, but we have to start with something. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3945.253s">So</a> let's start with what we're doing right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3949.794s">And</a> that's my motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=3951.295s">I</a> hope everybody got that.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4107.809s">What</a> did member Kreatz say? <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4109.85s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4112.611s">No,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4120.054s">Yeah,</a> I just said no because I would just like to strike that whole section, that whole sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4126.496s">So</a> I'm just not in agreement with that sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4130.028s">So</a> that's why I'm no.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4141.317s">Yes,</a> motion on the floor to strike the sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4144.24s">The</a> entire last sentence, the superintendent is not authorized to respond to city council requests, attend school committee meeting, city council meetings, or perform any actions requested by the city council without a majority vote at the school committee.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4277.058s">Member</a> Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4280.22s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4280.8s">So</a> I still have the motion on the floor for the beginning part of the <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4286.999s">The</a> rule, the way that I had, you know, read that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4291.462s">So</a> I'm not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4293.103s">I</a> don't remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4294.824s">Did</a> I have a second by anybody on the way that I had worded it?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4305.29s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4308.192s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4311.887s">I'm</a> just looking at it right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4313.487s">I</a> think I erased a word, but I was making changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4316.168s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4316.428s">Oh,</a> shoot. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4319.089s">I</a> think I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4319.749s">One</a> second. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4320.089s">Let</a> me just grab this for a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4321.309s">Because</a> when I was typing, I actually think I erased some words. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4326.33s">Oh,</a> gosh. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4327.291s">Let</a> me see number 77. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4327.871s">It's</a> right in front of the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4329.651s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4330.171s">Let's</a> see. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4342.501s">Okay,</a> so this is what I had originally said. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4346.564s">All</a> requests passed by Medford City Council that pertain to Medford Public Schools will be sent to the school committee chair and will be reviewed with the superintendent to determine if it can be answered or needs to be added to the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4377.244s">And</a> yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4379.765s">Can</a> you put that in the chat for me? <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4381.386s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4381.646s">Let</a> me do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4382.327s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4382.607s">Cause</a> I, let me get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4384.548s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4384.748s">I'm</a> gonna do that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4386.829s">Just</a> looking around. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4388.99s">Oh,</a> there it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4389.55s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4389.67s">All</a> right.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4406.522s">I</a> think that sounds fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4408.183s">I'm</a> just going to go get the language again. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4412.364s">Instead</a> of typing, I'm going to try to copy and paste it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4414.965s">Let's</a> see.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4428.847s">I'm</a> just going to be typing. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4429.727s">I'm</a> sorry, guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4430.828s">I</a> actually did remove a sentence from the original document on my Google Drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4436.929s">So</a> I've got to retype it.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4523.575s">And</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4524.155s">Graham,</a> if you want to, I'm putting it in the chat now. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4526.716s">Let</a> me just get back to the chat. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4530.857s">Getting</a> a little twisted.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4552.685s">Oh,</a> I don't know if you can see it, because when I see it, I can see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4557.087s">You</a> can in normal, like it's not all crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4559.868s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4560.628s">The</a> way it shows for me, it's giant. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4562.509s">So,</a> all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4564.41s">So,</a> if you want to copy and paste and then put the portion that you were talking about, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4571.593s">Graham,</a> where that would fit.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4641.583s">Last</a> sentence, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4642.823s">And</a> by the way, I just did my grammar check and I made some changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4648.565s">Grammarly</a> told me to make some changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4650.445s">So</a> I just repasted it with the grammar, correct grammar, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4654.846s">So</a> take a look at the new little post that I just did in the chat because I have my grammar check in another area.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4666.089s">Yeah,</a> sorry.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4698.613s">So</a> do I have a second on the motion, the way that it's prepared and checked?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4708.767s">Yes,</a> as amended by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4709.908s">Graham.</a> 
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4762.199s">I'm</a> just gonna go into my notes again. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4765.358s">I</a> just closed everything down when I was around. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4768.368s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4789.994s">Um,</a> it's, it's not really a concern, but it was just maybe an add to number 82. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4795.956s">It's</a> currently 82 says the secretary will actively monitor remote participants. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4801.438s">I'm</a> just thinking it should say, um, the secretary and the mayor and the secretary will actively monitor, uh, remote participants to identify when there was a hand raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4812.341s">So</a> that way there, we have two eyes looking out the mayor and the secretary to just make sure everybody's heard.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4824.533s">Oh,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4825.254s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4825.834s">Then</a> I guess, you know, then let me, just to have another person on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4830.818s">So</a> then my amendment would say the secretary and superintendent or another administrator, designated administrator will actively monitor remote participants to identify when there's a hand raised.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4919.321s">I</a> think number 83 is redundant with 82. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4923.606s">83</a> says the secretary will ensure the chair is aware when remote participants wish to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4929.778s">that</a> it's the same as number 82, I'm thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=4934.56s">So</a> I just think we should just strike number 83 because it's redundant.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=5108.547s">Yep,</a> and I withdraw mine.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=5164.699s">Yes,</a> I wanted to mention on number 84. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=5168.461s">I</a> think there just needs to be an exception to this rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=5172.763s">So</a> I think it should say the superintendent will be present in person or via remote participation at all regular meetings of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=5180.787s">With</a> the exception of <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=5184.297s">illness,</a> bereavement, or emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=5188.261s">You</a> know, I would like to just hear from the superintendent about what her thoughts are on that because, you know, people are going to get sick, there are going to be family emergencies, you know, so that's what I was thinking.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=5487.967s">I</a> had a question about number 90 so I don't know if you want to finish the conversation that's currently ongoing, and then I can go after that, please.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=5635.784s">Yes,</a> I just wanted to ask the superintendent about the rule number 90. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=5640.826s">I</a> believe this is a new rule that's being put forth and this would be something that would be handled by her team. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=5650.311s">So</a> I would just like to hear from Dr. Edward-Vinson on what her thoughts are on rule 90. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=5656.514s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2022-03-07_zg4eBCSCY8E/2022-03-07_zg4eBCSCY8E.html">Regular School Committee Meeting - 3.7.2022</a></h2>

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=3382.044s">So</a> yes, thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=3383.546s">And</a> so it says the student placement is based on the teacher recommendation and parent input. <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=3389.691s">Is</a> there going to be a <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=3391.42s">you</a> know, a decision date, like will the students and the families know where they're going to be going, whether they're going into integrated math, or are they just going to fill out a form that says, you know, I want to go traditional route, or I want to go integrated math.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=3480.409s">And</a> one last question, because we're approaching the budget season and this is going to be a new pilot. <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=3486.134s">Will</a> we be needing any additional math teachers? <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=3489.057s">What</a> if there's an increase in <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=3491.293s">integrated</a> math versus traditional pathways? <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=3494.735s">I</a> was just thinking ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=3496.495s">That's</a> a great question.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6785.941s">Yeah,</a> I'm just curious like if we're gonna reach out to those families to just let them know that, you know, in advance, these are gonna be some changes and you can either drop down to three or increase to five. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6797.826s">And</a> then there's also the tuition, you know, application for a discount if needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6803.288s">Yeah,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6804.289s">All</a> right, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6805.729s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2022-02-07_95e_A3W3mNI/2022-02-07_95e_A3W3mNI.html">2.7.2022 - Regular School Committee Meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=529.896s">Yeah,</a> so I was actually going to bring up number nine, because last year, Paulette and I we put forth a resolution to change the start times of the meetings to 630. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=543.59s">And</a> because we had received feedback from the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=548.075s">last</a> school year um that they preferred to start at 7 p.m and we had gotten we we had started at just different times like we were starting at 5 sometimes 6 sometimes 6 30 so we as a group um accepted the resolution and chose 6 30 you know as a happy medium for the public administrators etc um so i mean if <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=575.896s">You</a> know, I guess like, how does everybody else feel about that start time? <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=580.921s">You</a> know, could we try it at six and we might have to change this rule if it's not working out for the community, you know, to make it to the meetings.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=730.632s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1183.925s">Yep,</a> so I'm not ready to vote on this yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1186.287s">I</a> didn't get to speak on it yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1188.008s">I</a> did have concerns about the meeting in August. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1193.253s">I'm</a> not in favor of having a meeting in August. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1196.315s">We</a> haven't had meeting in August and I've been on school committee for six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1201.099s">Last</a> year and the year before during COVID, we got an email from the superintendent with an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1209.386s">And</a> that went very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1212.867s">And</a> so I would like to make a friendly amendment to have an email communication from the superintendent with an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1222.709s">And</a> if members have questions or concerns, they could speak directly with the superintendent during the summer over the phone if they have any questions or concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1236.249s">So</a> I'm making a motion to amend this to, there will be, the superintendent will send out a broadcast communication to the committee members in August, maybe the first Monday. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1253.679s">And</a> I think what she was doing actually, I'm sorry, she was sending out updates every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1260.774s">So</a> let me just get back to what I was saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1263.755s">So</a> I'm making a motion to amend this to say the superintendent will send out a broadcast communication to all members, a brief broadcast memo to all members each week in August. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=1279.701s">It</a> doesn't have to be on a Monday, maybe on the Friday at the end of the week.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2011.716s">Um,</a> so I I'm, I'm not in favor of having a summer meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2015.917s">Um,</a> you know, I still want to keep my motion on the floor to having, um, communication brought, you know, updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2024.773s">You</a> know, I think at any point, an emergency meeting can be called, you know, if we had to. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2032.379s">So</a> I'm still gonna keep my amendment as is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2035.442s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2163.15s">I</a> felt the same way, Mayor, and I actually had the same feedback written down that you just mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2169.653s">So</a> I wanted to hear from the rest of the committee.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2241.852s">I</a> motion to change it to the following Monday.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2415.411s">Okay,</a> um, yeah, so I was, I just want to get back to a kind of loss. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2420.776s">Okay,</a> here it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2421.296s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2422.357s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2422.617s">So</a> when I was reading this rule, I was just thinking back to earlier this month, the January 3 meeting was postponed until the 10th. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2431.484s">And,</a> you know, I just found out, you know, just by getting the, <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2436.488s">the</a> change date, zoom, um, you know, meeting request. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2440.372s">Um,</a> so I I'm not familiar with the current process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2444.216s">Um,</a> you know, how was it handled? <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2446.458s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2447.66s">You</a> know, I don't think, you know, we've officially had a process to postpone it and it's been at the discretion of the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2457.61s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2460.686s">And</a> I'm wondering if somebody could just maybe help answer that question? <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2463.669s">Because</a> we haven't had a process or a rule on canceling or postponing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2470.216s">It's</a> typically been at the discretion of the superintendent or the mayor.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2564.605s">Yes,</a> so I was reading ahead and there's another number that connects with this number, I think, number 17. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2573.111s">In</a> the event of an emergency due to extraordinary circumstances, the requirement that notification of cancellation is provided in writing may be waived and members may notify the superintendent of their desire to cancel the meeting, email or in person, any verbal requests must be followed with a written request. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2592.771s">The</a> two rules are in two different sections. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2596.253s">And</a> I think it should just be consolidated into one rule, you know, that goes, you know, into both of these situations, because we're talking about canceling a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2609.659s">And,</a> you know, it should include in the event of an emergency, you know, in a situation like this, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2617.862s">It's</a> at the discretion of the superintendent to cancel the meeting by telephone, email, or in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2624.248s">Um,</a> we did have, you know, if there is a snow storm the day of the meeting, you know, we would have to cancel the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2631.233s">Um,</a> something like that could happen, especially in the winter months.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2711.635s">Yes,</a> I'm just trying to think of something I was gonna say. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2716.979s">So,</a> cause I know Mr. Russo wants the exact word. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2722.003s">So</a> I'm trying to think of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2724.045s">So</a> I'm making a motion <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2727.987s">to</a> amend number 14 to say no meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2733.489s">Sorry,</a> let me just catch my train of thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=2742.853s">The</a> superintendent and or mayor have the discretion to cancel a meeting and notify all committee members via email as soon as possible.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3299.27s">Member</a> Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3301.207s">Um,</a> yes, I'm member Ruseau, would you be willing to amended to say something like the chair will schedule to optional annual joint meetings with the city council, a budget meeting will be held in the spring of the, you know, of each year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3320.515s">a</a> general meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3321.475s">So</a> I guess I'm confused about the general meeting in March on goals, because I'm thinking spring is typically March, April, so.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3469.089s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3469.709s">Um,</a> I'm amenable to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3471.669s">Um,</a> I motion to change the word wording to say the chair will schedule one annual joint meeting with the city council and everything else that was previously stated will remain the same.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3560.178s">Yes,</a> so I was reading through, I'm just going all the way to 30, just let's see. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3568.523s">Okay,</a> so let me just get back up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3575.327s">I'm</a> just reading my notes that I wrote about one of these. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3577.929s">I'm</a> on number 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3583.339s">Oh,</a> in number 21, in number 22, I noticed something, but I wasn't sure why it wasn't in number 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3594.542s">So</a> in the rule 22, it states the meeting will not be broadcast or recorded. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3601.063s">However,</a> being a public meeting, the meeting will allow members of the public to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3606.205s">The</a> public will not be offered an opportunity to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3610.546s">So</a> that, <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3612.306s">You</a> know, that was in rule 22, it wasn't in rule 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3615.609s">So</a> I wasn't sure, you know, the workshop. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3625.216s">We're</a> not gonna have the public come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3628.018s">It's</a> not gonna be broadcasted because we're getting training on something. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3632.562s">And</a> what is the difference between that and the retreat? <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3637.706s">I</a> think I was getting the two, the workshop and the retreat. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3640.749s">I</a> was just thinking about when the MASC was here and I think we called it a retreat and Dorothy came in and we didn't invite members of the public to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3652.378s">And</a> we had a discussion <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3655.14s">on</a> our own, where we could talk and, you know, converse, ask questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3660.861s">We</a> didn't, it wasn't recorded. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3664.242s">And</a> we didn't invite members of the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3666.503s">So</a> I'm not sure if how everybody feels about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3673.844s">If</a> somebody members.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3797.6s">Yes,</a> I motion to accept that friendly suggestion to strike 21 and <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3805.942s">change,</a> well, combine it and just make it one, you know, one rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3811.345s">Workshops</a> and or retreats may be scheduled on an as-needed basis and everything else would be the same.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3864.158s">Yes,</a> on number 23, I'm just not really sure I follow this rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3872.742s">It</a> says the chair or vice chair of the school committee will, when needed, have a standing meeting with the superintendent prior to any scheduled meeting, workshop or hearing to collaborate on the agenda, setting and help focus on the agenda and superintendent on the goals of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3890.729s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3894.363s">You</a> know, I, we, we haven't been doing something like that, um, where the vice chair has been collaborating. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3903.17s">With</a> the superintendent and the mayor about the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3907.573s">So</a> I, I was making a motion to, to, you know, to strike just the word, the vice chair, the chair, or. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3919.056s">The</a> chair of the school committee will, when needed, have a standing meeting with the superintendent prior to any scheduled meeting, workshop, or hearing to collaborate on the agenda, setting to help focus both the agenda of the school committee and the superintendent on goals of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3936.551s">Such</a> standing meetings will be held with agreement between the superintendent and the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3943.417s">And</a> the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=3944.918s">It</a> would also just be me.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4089.763s">How</a> do you feel about the, <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4093.072s">the</a> way it's proposed and superintendent, I would just like to hear from you.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4202.745s">Yes,</a> so I have a motion on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4207.089s">I'm</a> going to amend it to say the chair of the school committee, and when unavailable, will delegate.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4221.582s">To</a> the vice chair, when needed, have a standing meeting and continue, everything else is gonna be the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4229.122s">And</a> at the end, the last sentence will say, such standing meetings will be held by agreement between the superintendent and the chair or vice chair if delegated.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4338.721s">I'm</a> going to get it ready right now.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4793.677s">Sorry,</a> I was emailing Mr. Russo at the same time, and I missed what number we're talking about right now?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4830.97s">I</a> have a question about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4832.091s">So</a> are we gonna, does this mean the school committee we're going to evaluate each other's performance? <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4842.119s">May</a> I know?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4942.282s">Yes,</a> I actually had that written down. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4944.943s">I</a> was gonna make a motion that we, and I know Mr. Russo wants the exact wording, so I'm just gonna read what it says right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4957.512s">Okay,</a> so agenda for all regular meetings by the school committee will be available to the public and press copies of the agenda will be filed with the office and clerk and posted on the website of the school committee, no later than Thursday. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4972.025s">Prior</a> to the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4973.326s">Prior</a> to the scheduled meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4977.699s">copies</a> of the agenda will be made available at the Medford Public Library. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4982.46s">Is</a> that something that we currently do? <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4985.621s">Copies</a> at the Medford Public Library?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4991.843s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4992.503s">So</a> I wanna strike that sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4997.545s">Okay,</a> so copies made available. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=4999.725s">Okay,</a> so let me just go back one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5002.646s">So</a> I'm gonna delete that sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5008.49s">just</a> as you just deleted copies of the agenda will be posted on line. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5013.331s">Because</a> that is what we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5017.652s">We</a> post the agenda online, and it's it's broadcasting of information.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5128.196s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5128.977s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5488.37s">Yes,</a> right, that was gonna get removed, yes, yep.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5538.493s">Motion</a> to change it to 630.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5575.85s">Mayor,</a> I had a question on, sorry, I'm just trying to, it was an earlier number, I didn't get to ask the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5583.657s">It</a> was in the 40s, I'm getting there now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5588.061s">Yes,</a> it was number 40. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5591.282s">The</a> agenda will include a listing of all recommendations being brought forward such as listing with a formatted format in accordance with the be dB agenda creation and format regular meetings the agenda will also include a listing of all motions reports and other communications and reports to the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5609.947s">So</a> that is currently what we're doing, but it doesn't right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5616.148s">The</a> agenda does not contain a listing of all the motions that we've taken at meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5625.551s">So</a> I'm just motioning to remove that word <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5632.546s">because</a> right now the agenda doesn't list all the motions.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5641.889s">Oh.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5642.409s">Yeah,</a> so motion to change the word to resolutions.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5717.052s">Sorry.</a> 
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5724.042s">Yes,</a> okay, sorry, because when I minimize and maximize, I get back, sorry, I'm going there now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5729.527s">Okay,</a> so number 52, I am not in favor of the way that this is, the way that the rule is written. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5739.495s">The</a> rule states public comment will be limited to three minutes per individual and will be limited to those matters on the agenda that I'm fine with. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5750.959s">Members</a> of the public wishing to speak must register their intent prior to the meeting on a form provided for said purpose by the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5761.308s">That</a> I would like to remove that sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5765.892s">The</a> chair may limit the comment to two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5768.174s">I'm</a> fine with that on the number of individuals signed up to speak, but okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5774.179s">So</a> the chair may limit the comments <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5779.551s">for</a> public participation to two minutes as needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5783.474s">And</a> if it was a busy night, the chair will announce the time limit prior to public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5791.241s">Yes,</a> at every regular meeting, the public will also be encouraged to submit their comments in writing via email or by emailing the superintendent that we're currently doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5801.43s">Written</a> comments will be forwarded to all members. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5804.452s">That</a> is what Mr. Russo is doing currently right now with the auto forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5809.675s">And</a> we had discussion about this at our last meeting, and we are going to, I think, be moving away from submitting the comments via email, or we're not going to be reading them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5827.743s">So</a> there's a lot here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5830.144s">I</a> definitely want to remove <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5835.239s">The</a> part where it says members of the public wishing to speak must register their intent prior to the meeting on a form. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5842.726s">That</a> is an inconvenience for the public to register and what their comments are going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5848.812s">So</a> I'm not in favor of the way that this is currently written and I'm proposing to change it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=5855.239s">removing</a> that sentence.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=6201.724s">Yes,</a> yeah, that's, I motion second that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=6206.546s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=6540.889s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=6541.87s">What</a> group of numbers are we going to talk about next? <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=6544.851s">I</a> want to just get through, look at my notes.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=6571.327s">I</a> don't have any questions on any of those numbers.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=6591.141s">I</a> can wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=6592.582s">I</a> have a question on 77, so I can hold off for now.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=7102.691s">Yes,</a> I was going to ask for some clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=7105.153s">And</a> so, so this rule essentially is giving us the permission to suspend the rules, to move an agenda item out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=7116.923s">That's,</a> that's what you're saying, Mr. Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=7118.545s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=7118.765s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Csi-YZOcLIg&t=7186.544s">Um,</a> I forgot to lower my hand.<h2><a href="../2022-01-24_OqhVXheg_Mw/2022-01-24_OqhVXheg_Mw.html">1.24.2022 - COW to Discuss Subcommittee Structure and Function</a></h2>
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=540.358s">Okay,</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=541.619s">I</a> have the same question that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=543.08s">McLaughlin</a> had. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=544.361s">I</a> did look at our upcoming agenda for this evening, and there's a resolution that Mr. Russo has put on with the list of functions and duties that he put together, a draft that he's proposing to us in a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=558.631s">So</a> I was wondering, and I know it would take time to probably have another committee of the whole to discuss the functions and duties that are proposed in that resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=569.869s">You</a> know, so I was wondering, you know, like for now, maybe we could remove that and put it back in so that we can, you know, kind of move forward with this resolution so that, you know, we can begin, you know, following the procedures of referring things to the subcommittee and going through scheduling that way.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=900.581s">Um,</a> yes, I wanted to talk about what, what, the way that I read it was, um, I, it seems like some of the subcommittees don't actually fit with the way the resolution's written because, you know, not every subcommittee is making policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=917.638s">Like</a> for example, the building and ground subcommittee meetings, we weren't meeting to set policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=924.264s">We</a> were meeting to talk about updates, like for the Mebita High School sign, hear information from the vocational principal about the great things students are doing, things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=936.23s">We</a> were getting updates on the status of where things were with the generator or the boiler. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=943.614s">We</a> weren't making policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=945.675s">And</a> the same would be for the personnel subcommittee that I've been on. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=951.417s">I</a> mean, I think that, <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=953.134s">there's</a> been a resolution on the agenda, you know, to have some descriptions of, you know, occupations, which, you know, could be some sort of a policy, but that's not everything that takes place in the personnel subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=968.867s">We've</a> met to interview for new hires, things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=973.871s">So,</a> you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=976.046s">I</a> think, you know, I can understand what the CPAC board is stating in their email because, you know, not every subcommittee is setting policies all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=989.271s">Yes,</a> sometimes we will set a policy in the subcommittee, you know, occasionally for some, but not for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=996.613s">It's</a> not all about policymaking.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1616.455s">So</a> I just have a question and you know, you know, I understand like, you know, what you want us to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1622.778s">Like,</a> I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1624.359s">Um,</a> so like, let's use my example. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1626.6s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1627.52s">I</a> am the, um, building and grounds chairperson and, um, we're in this new policy just, you know, for the future, we were in this new policy and, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1638.015s">I</a> got some emails from some members and, you know, we've been hearing for years that there should be a sign in Everett high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1644.24s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1644.82s">So,</a> um, it's not a policy, but I could, and this is just, this is what, is this what I could do? <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1652.666s">Like</a> I could then write a resolution that says I'm making a resolution that, um, I, <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1660.435s">schedule</a> a building and ground subcommittee meeting so that we can discuss options for a sign from Everett High School and then it would go, I would do the add the agenda button or link and I would send it off and then it would go on the agenda at one meeting and then here we would make the full vote if the body wanted to. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1682.532s">have</a> that meeting, they would take that vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1684.493s">If</a> they didn't, it wouldn't pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1687.575s">So,</a> and I guess like going forward in the future, you know, some of these subcommittees are non, they're not always making policy, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1697.219s">So,</a> I mean, I can understand Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1699.08s">McLaughlin's</a> points. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1701.321s">So</a> I was thinking something, you know, over the past couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1704.523s">I</a> don't know if it would help in any way, but I think it might if there was, <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1709.38s">A</a> lot of things I've been looking at have exceptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1711.982s">There</a> can be exceptions to the rule, and maybe there could be an exception that, and I don't have the exact, perfect wording, but in some subcommittees, <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1725.27s">they</a> can have regular scheduled meetings per year, XX. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1732.053s">Let's</a> say I don't have the perfect number or anything either, but I know in my meetings, I've only had two or three the most. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1741.076s">So</a> like for some subcommittees, they should plan to meet four times per year or more. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1749.468s">three</a> times per year, you know, and it doesn't necessarily have to list the subcommittees because that can be part of the functions and duties once those are determined, but we're not there yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1760.873s">So,</a> so that was just something I was thinking about that, you know, we're, the rule is so specific for the policy making subcommittees, but it's just, you know, it's, it has to be a little bit broader to, you know, to go into more depth for the other subcommittees, cause it doesn't really work for all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1778.001s">That's</a> what I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1779.141s">You</a> know, and I did, you know, reach out and talk to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1784.505s">Van</a> der Kloot and she did explain to me that this is how the policy was, you know, before I came on board as a school committee member. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1794.553s">And</a> then things kind of shifted away and we started doing things. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1799.087s">the</a> other way, which is the way we've been doing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1801.888s">So</a> she did explain it to me that this is how it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1805.528s">And</a> so, and I guess now I'm trying to figure out if this is how it was, and I never knew what it was like, you know, what do I do? <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1812.87s">And</a> then I was talking to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1814.17s">McLaughlin</a> at one point, and it seemed like our subcommittees had just like defunct because we never had them. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1821.611s">And</a> then it just kind of set into me, I was a new subcommittee member, a new school committee member, <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1826.912s">And</a> I didn't know that I was supposed to refer things to subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1829.875s">So</a> I just, we didn't have them, honestly. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1832.877s">And</a> then we did every once in a while Mia would get a lot of emails and then we would get in touch with the mayor and then the mayor would then put it on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1842.165s">And</a> then we would have the subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1843.586s">So</a> then I thought it through and I'm like, oh my God, that's what we did do. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1847.37s">But</a> I didn't know because it was never written down. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1849.772s">Like</a> you said, we never had anything written down, none of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=1854.035s">you</a> know so now we're we're trying to put something together um and i think we do need something but at the same time it's not going to work for every solid you know every subcommittee you know there can be exceptions um maybe i can just i i think it can work because number three it doesn't say policy on here it says um carry out business so for you it would be
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2309.969s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2310.649s">So,</a> um, I know I mentioned, you know, adding an exception, you know, to this, um, resolution, you know, that some subcommittees, you know, as needed may have, you know, three <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2328.75s">you</a> know, scheduled subcommittee meetings, which would be like at the beginning of the year, the middle of the year and the end of the year, so that, you know, we could hear some feedback from, you know, like, for example, the CPAC meeting, which is, you know, I think that for that subcommittee, you know, it seems like <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2347.748s">You</a> know, I remember when Erin had taken on that responsibility and she took it upon herself and she held those meetings and invited everybody to those meetings and it was very productive and the results were shared and it was a good working relationship. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2363.801s">I</a> mean, if three is too much, you could start with two and then add, like, that's why I was thinking of adding it as an exception. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2372.588s">You</a> know, I'm saying for my committee, <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2375.29s">I</a> don't think I'm going to have a problem with my committees adding it as a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2380.114s">But,</a> you know, when I think about Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2382.617s">McLaughlin's</a> committee, you know, you know, that that seems a little bit difficult because <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2389.953s">you</a> know, we have been having them regularly scheduled just the past year, like, you know, on a regularly scheduled calendar event. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2398.662s">So</a> it just seems very abrupt. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2400.705s">We're</a> going to, you know, discontinue that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2402.527s">And</a> I understand that, you know, it's involving a lot of personnel and their time. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2407.872s">And</a> I understand that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2409.574s">that</a> the time is associated with the monetary value, you know, because they're spending the time at those meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2415.222s">But,</a> you know, if they're informational and we're sharing information and, you know, we're receiving information from the public, I think it's beneficial to continue with the meetings, you know, if, <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2425.457s">it</a> was agreeable with all the individuals involved on the specific number of meetings per year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2432.223s">And</a> that's why I say like to start, have two. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2436.146s">I</a> mean, I'm just thinking and I'm getting ahead of myself, but like reading the policies that were set forth by Mr. Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2443.311s">In</a> his policy, one of the mentions having two annual meetings with, <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2450.717s">with,</a> um, city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2452.798s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2453.358s">So,</a> so that's specific in his rules and functions. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2457.199s">Why</a> can't we have something specific in the rules and functions specifically pertaining to the CPAC, you know, um, and, and their disability, you know, committee, the behavioral health special education. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2470.473s">You</a> know, I mean, I know that I'm kind of getting ahead of myself because, you know, we are at the beginning stages of writing documents and, you know, it's the first time we're doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2481.357s">We've</a> never done this. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2482.397s">So</a> we want to do it and we want to do it right, you know, to make it fit for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2487.999s">And</a> some of them is just not going to fit for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2490.94s">And</a> I think as needed, that's why if we put an exception and we don't list them, because there might be an exception and, <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2497.757s">you</a> know, maybe those subcommittees just, you know, it's better for them to have the regular meetings, but not necessarily every month. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2507.584s">That's</a> just an idea.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2604.181s">Yes,</a> I would like to make an amendment that we have an exception to the rule that allows for <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2613.548s">subcommittees</a> as needed to have scheduled <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2619.065s">you</a> know, let's just say for the purpose of the document to have two or three scheduled subcommittee meetings per year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2628.369s">And</a> honestly, I don't think some of the committee members are going to do that, but I do think that some of the committees are going to need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2635.372s">Like</a> I can see right off the top, the personnel, we don't need something like that for the personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2639.974s">We,</a> we hardly meet about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2641.794s">So</a> it just, it makes sense for some, I mean, the rules, it's always going to have policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2647.016s">That's</a> a policy making, <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2648.598s">subcommittee.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2650.692s">you</a> know, the engagement communication that had some policy in it, but then it also had discussion and it had topics about afterschool pay and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2660.637s">So</a> in the curriculum, that would be policy, you know, so like most of them are going to be, you know, it's going to be easy to follow the resolution to add them on the agenda, but then for the committees that don't, I think it's, you know, fair to, <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2680.266s">Let</a> me look at the new subcommittees. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2681.387s">Sorry,</a> I was looking at last year's. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2684.509s">Some</a> of the newer ones, diversity and equity, I think for those to start with in the strategic planning, I think to start with, they would have to maybe have at least one or two meetings per year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=2698.559s">They're</a> newer committees.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=3217.203s">Before</a> we take the vote, could I just mention just on the amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=3224.492s">have</a> one meeting per year listening session and maybe and if needed, you know, to have an additional meeting if necessary, something like that.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=3258.336s">And</a> it's not going to list the subcommittee, so it's not going to exclude any subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=3262.157s">It</a> may, if they want to.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=3264.737s">It</a> may or may not. <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=3265.177s">Yeah.</a> <h2><a href="../2022-01-24_DnBk5C8-dFs/2022-01-24_DnBk5C8-dFs.html">1.24.2022 - Regular School Committee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3480.449s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3481.35s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3483.351s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3483.792s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3484.392s">Um,</a> yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3485.273s">So,</a> um, I have a question and you might've mentioned it and I just might've missed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3490.037s">Um,</a> you did say that students will need to opt in to get the rapid test. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3493.719s">So</a> I wanted to know, um, are these, are they, is there going to be a distribution of the test kits and you know, they're going to be sent home every week or every two weeks, or is this, <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3505.201s">they're</a> still going to be doing the rapid tests in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3507.944s">I</a> just, I wasn't sure what that meant because I've been hearing some communications on the news where if schools opt in, they're going to be sending home the kits to the families. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3517.775s">Is</a> that what we're doing or we're not doing that?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=3627.084s">And</a> is there a new consent form in the works right now?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=5230.136s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=5234.26s">I</a> just wanted to say, you know, this sounds so exciting and there's so many offerings and it's terrific. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=5240.766s">The</a> staff that you mentioned, the 20 to 28 staff members who have already, you know, their willingness to participate in the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=5247.792s">It</a> just sounds incredible and it's very exciting.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9778.989s">Motion</a> to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9780.77s">Before</a> we, I just have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9784.313s">Yes,</a> so I was a little confused when I read this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9788.917s">Are</a> you taking out, like this is, the way I read this is that you're removing residents may also submit their comments by writing the superintendent prior to the meeting or by emailing and provide the school, you know, school committee email prior to or during the, <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9804.756s">item</a> on the agenda, written comments must be kept to a length, which will allow them to be read into the record for less than three minutes, so forth, that whole sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9815.003s">And</a> then it picks up a welcome inclusive community, which it picks up down here. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9819.666s">So</a> it does, the way that the new section that you want us to add in, the way I read it, is that we're removing that you can email the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9833.569s">That's</a> how I read it too, and I'm not okay with that.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9844.294s">Voted</a> to use, to remove the school committee email?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9848.756s">I</a> don't remember doing that at all.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10022.018s">I</a> just had a follow up question. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10023.439s">So</a> since the community can still write to that email address, you know, is there anywhere in this policy where we can state that <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10035.397s">you</a> can continue to send your emails to this email, because like right now we're just removing that entire, you know, that piece about writing to the email and that the email will be received by all school committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10048.24s">You</a> know, they will be copied on all, you know, all those emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10052.421s">Is</a> there any way we can incorporate that here, you know, just a statement, you know, for transparency reasons that, you know, you can still continue to write this email address? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10065.175s">because</a> I really honestly, you know, I just remembered us, the situation happening differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10072.14s">I</a> do remember that Mr. Russo wasn't going to read all the statements or make a determination on whether some could be read or some could not be read. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10081.726s">But</a> I do think that we should, you know, continue to keep the email address, you know, for transparency reasons.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10102.213s">In</a> the policy, but not in this language that's going to go on the agenda.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10121.292s">I</a> think even just a little asterisk with the footnote, I think would be helpful for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10127.916s">It's</a> just gonna be one little, you know, italicized footnote.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10798.112s">Mayor,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10799.307s">I</a> would like to motion that we move this to a committee of the whole meeting so that all members can participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10805.733s">I</a> read through the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10808.556s">I</a> want to first thank member Ruseau for putting this together in the time and effort that he must have spent putting this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10814.502s">And</a> as he mentioned in the email, he spent three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10818.145s">So</a> I don't think it's appropriate for us tonight <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10821.008s">to</a> go through a document that he spent three years working on, and we're not gonna be able to provide our input. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10828.451s">We</a> need to be able to provide some input and feedback and possible amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10834.634s">And</a> I think the only way we can do this is with a committee of the whole and going through line by line. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10841.537s">Now,</a> I don't think some of the numbers necessarily, I don't have an issue with all the numbers, but I do have many questions on many numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10851.055s">and</a> I think we could go through it and go through like a set of 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10855.777s">One</a> to 10, approve, yes or no. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10857.817s">Okay,</a> what number do we wanna discuss? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10860.158s">I</a> don't think we have to go through every single solitary number, but we need to do this as a group and not through a rule subcommittee, then come back here, and then we have more questions, and then it's just gonna go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10871.601s">So</a> I think the only way we could do this is with the Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10873.942s">And</a> then we can have a motion.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11226.508s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11226.789s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11227.129s">That's</a> a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11228.07s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11327.855s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11329.035s">So</a> I think I was confused about what this meant. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11333.518s">So</a> what you're saying is that you want to <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11339.197s">You</a> understand, and I understand, that four members of the committee constitute a quorum, and that a smaller group, which would be three, mean they could meet and adjourn from day to day, but that could be a violation of the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11355.091s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11355.892s">Because</a> that's a subcommittee, and a subcommittee would have to be posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11360.957s">I</a> guess that, I was looking for clarification.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11414.088s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11414.568s">So</a> that's what this, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11415.929s">So</a> I understand now this was just cleaning up the policy and you know, I, the way I read it, I thought you wanted to, you know, you know, appeal that members could meet and adjourn. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11429.373s">And</a> I said, I was confused and I started reading open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11432.334s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11432.654s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11433.094s">So</a> you didn't need that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11434.095s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11434.275s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12470.874s">Yes,</a> I just wanted, I had a question and just maybe need some clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12476.257s">So</a> is this flagship committee doing the research and making the recommendation whether it's going to be a new school, a refurbished high school, or is this committee deciding on the educational direction that we're taking? <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12492.749s">I</a> just wasn't sure because of the MSBA information that was in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12497.532s">a</a> lot of the other goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12499.033s">If</a> somebody could clarify that, thank you.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12600.006s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12600.387s">So</a> the committee will receive like the MSBA statement of interest that was submitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12605.348s">So</a> they'll know what they're looking at and it's still going to take us probably another <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12610.84s">you</a> know, till the end of the year for us to hear back on whether we're going to get the MSDA. <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12614.903s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12615.504s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12616.105s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12616.465s">So</a> I thank you for the clarification.<h2><a href="../2022-01-10_RhUNhYl62Oo/2022-01-10_RhUNhYl62Oo.html">Regular School Committee Meeting - January 10, 2022</a></h2>

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=672.749s">Mayor,</a> I just wanted to say that for the good of the order. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=676.931s">I</a> thought that the orientation that the superintendent put on and I think it was Dorothy from the MSC she had come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=685.275s">It</a> was very informative and a refresher for all of us as we're, you know, getting back into a new term. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=693.519s">you</a> know, because sometimes we can, we know what we're doing, but sometimes we can forget and get away from what we should be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=700.96s">So</a> I think it would be great and, you know, look forward to doing that.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4102.584s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4103.285s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4104.125s">Yes,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4106.167s">Miss</a> Hines Mr. Murphy and everybody for the report, and, you know, all the nurses for everything you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4113.392s">So</a> I just wanted to know if. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4116.534s">Currently</a> on our website, we do have the Medford School COVID exposure guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4122.897s">So</a> will that be updated for next week? <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4126.759s">Because</a> it still has some of the information, you know, tested positive for COVID-19, must isolate for 10 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=4134.382s">I</a> think that will have to be updated, you know, if we could, you know, in preparation for next week,
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7209.101s">I</a> spoke first, sorry, but I'll- It doesn't, you can go first, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7213.663s">McLaughlin,</a> that's fine.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7307.526s">Okay,</a> yep. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7309.247s">So</a> I thank you for bringing this to us, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7312.968s">Graham.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7313.548s">So</a> I have, I was reading number three and I just need some clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7318.97s">So</a> do you mean that like, so for example, you know, I've been the chair for the building and grounds subcommittee and I have, you know, kind of developed the agenda with the assistance of Mr. Murphy, the superintendent, <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7334.875s">the</a> Director of Building and Grounds, and then community member input, what they're interested in hearing about. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7340.839s">So</a> for example, the Merritt High School sign was part of my agenda last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7346.063s">This</a> year, something that might be of interest would be bike racks for middle school and high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7353.649s">I</a> think I'm just confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7354.81s">So</a> are you saying that the chair would no longer create the agenda <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7362.939s">And</a> I would have to, or the person who's the chair would have to wait for something to get referred to the committee and how will that happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7373.323s">I</a> guess, you know, I had a lot of questions about number three. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7376.585s">I</a> was confused about number three.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7468.452s">Just</a> some clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7471.394s">I</a> guess I'm not following what you're saying I'm not talking about spending money. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7475.618s">I'm</a> simply talking about, you know, when I've been the chair of the building and grounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7482.965s">I've</a> received updates with exciting news from the vocational school, you know, different things the students are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7492.117s">I'm</a> not following what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7494.878s">I</a> mean, I'm not talking about spending money. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7498.239s">You</a> know, sometimes the meetings would be informational where I would be receiving information about updates or where we are with statuses of, you know, like let's say the walkie talkies or, you know, where we are with like last year, for example, where we were with the sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7517.886s">I'm</a> not following and I'm sorry, maybe if there's somebody else that would be able to explain it to me a little bit easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7524.276s">I'm</a> just not following like, how would items get referred to like, for example, <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7532.87s">Are</a> you saying that the only way to have something referred to the subcommittee is what, what you've been doing all along which is like putting your resolution on the agenda so like if I wanted to have something on the, on my like let's say I was the chair of the building and grounds and I wanted to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7553.061s">a</a> discussion on bike racks and what do we think we have? <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7557.044s">What</a> do we think we need? <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7558.845s">We're</a> not talking about money. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7560.826s">We're</a> just talking about having a community discussion, which I did get some emails on earlier in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7568.171s">And</a> we wanted to do something with that meeting, but we were held off because it was the election time. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7575.456s">So</a> we couldn't have subcommittee meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7577.197s">So</a> at some point that might've been an agenda item. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7582.848s">I</a> guess that I'm talking about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7585.109s">I'm</a> still, I don't know what number three means in terms of how does an item get, if I'm the chair of a committee, how does the item get on that agenda for the committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7598.953s">Cause</a> I used to be, or the chair would be the person who would build that agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7604.774s">Does</a> that help?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7767.956s">I</a> just have another follow up. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7772.799s">So</a> for example, I'm just thinking back to other agendas I've had. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7778.421s">So</a> if I had four or five, six or seven things that I was going to put on the agenda, are you saying I would do seven resolutions or seven separate resolutions that I would be putting on the agenda? <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7796.556s">It's</a> just something new and, you know, I'm just, I'm not sure where the mayor is going to be forming our subcommittees, you know, I don't know what. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7806.434s">What,</a> what is my responsibility? <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7808.135s">I'm</a> just, you know, I've been doing it the other way, building the agenda with the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7814.519s">I've</a> been working with the superintendent, the finance director, director of, you know, building and grounds and sometimes even city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7822.365s">So,</a> you know, I, I haven't been, let's say bypassing the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7827.448s">We</a> would only vote for things to move it out to the full committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7832.391s">And</a> then the full committee would take a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7835.153s">We</a> never, <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7836.634s">voted</a> on anything without the full support of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7843.262s">The</a> only thing that I'm seeing here differently is that in order for a chair to build their agenda, they first would have to add <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7857.369s">The</a> agenda items to the regular school committee as a resolution, get approval before they, the person could go and then schedule their subcommittee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7868.801s">Like</a> I guess you know like I guess I was just looking for more instructions, you know, because if I take this vote tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7878.429s">I</a> have to know what I'm doing as a chairperson. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7882.691s">Do</a> you see what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7886.533s">With</a> instructions, because I've been doing it one way the whole time, this is just a new way. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7891.916s">I</a> just have to know it all the way through. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7894.297s">How</a> am I going to do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7897.659s">The</a> way that I described it, <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7900.402s">how</a> it's going to be so like if I have four items that I don't have any items right now in fact but if I had four items I would put four resolutions you know that I would like this to be resolved that it would go on the building ground subcommittee because we would have to take a vote on each separate resolution which would be separate agenda item
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=7999.471s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=8000.412s">So</a> the way I understand it is to add a resolution and then it would get voted on. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=8006.556s">And</a> then if it was approved, then I could go ahead and build the agenda.<h2><a href="../2021-12-20_FZ9m9T3NFVU/2021-12-20_FZ9m9T3NFVU.html">12.20.2021 - Regular School Committee Meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=630.793s">Oh,</a> OK, because I think the last time we did it, there was like a tab for all the individual scores, because that's what I saw before. <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=639.955s">But</a> that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=641.275s">I</a> think it's just a little bit different. <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=642.615s">Or</a> maybe I'm just not remembering, even though it was just a few months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=645.776s">But</a> yes, no, I mean, I'm happy to see that the scores are very consistent with what I did for my evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=655.337s">So</a> I think we're all on the same page with, <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=660.358s">the</a> remarkable job that the superintendent has done this school year during the pandemic, you know, transitioning from fully remote over to hybrid, then in-person, then the return to school, the staggered start, and just making sure all the classrooms were ready and safe for all the students and the teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=683.579s">You</a> know, I think <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=685.681s">know,</a> with all the different bulletins that Lisa Evangelista sends out, you know, there was just communications, pictures with you at every school, where you were, you know, helping out here, you know, giving out meals, computers, you know, not computers, but the Google Chromebooks, and <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=704.26s">You</a> were there when all the students returned. <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=707.282s">You</a> made sure you went to every classroom at all the different events. <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=713.566s">I'm</a> just grateful for your leadership and what a great successful school year that we had despite the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=722.112s">And</a> I look forward to another successful year of learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=725.974s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12768.045s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13813.622s">Yes,</a> I've had the light on. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13815.204s">I</a> just have questions about each of the policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13819.648s">First,</a> I'm going to start with the calendar policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13824.573s">I</a> did watch the meeting on YouTube. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13827.516s">I</a> watched it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13829.841s">you</a> know, I tried to follow it the best I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13832.882s">So</a> I just have concerns about adding three additional no school days to the calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13840.184s">You</a> know, last week we had, you know, the high heat temperature days and I was getting messages from parents saying that I'm not sending my child to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13850.588s">It's</a> too hot to be in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13852.869s">And,</a> you know, this is going to be, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13856.75s">happening</a> if we're going to having the kids go to school to June 28 June 30th it they're going to be going in the hot hot temperatures adding three more no school days onto the calendar and with all the snow days I mean we don't know in New England it's unpredictable with what the snow days are going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13876.917s">I</a> do recall one year that my son went to school until June 29th because there were so many snow days and <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13884.18s">It</a> was really difficult for the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13886.522s">And</a> in fact, the students were done. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13889.223s">They</a> didn't wanna go and some families just went off on their vacations and didn't finish the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13897.428s">So</a> I would like to have an opportunity to see what other school districts in the greater Boston area are doing or in our neighboring area to know what the implication is of adding the three additional no school days to the calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13910.115s">So</a> I would like that information <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13912.157s">before</a> I was going to make a vote on adding those calendar days. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13917.147s">And</a> that's what, you know, that's what I have for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13920.169s">I</a> don't know if you want me to go on with the public comment and then I have for the agenda, I have some questions or thoughts for the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13927.533s">Do</a> you have an answer to that question? <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=13929.354s">I</a> do actually.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14115.913s">I'll</a> think about that, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14117.794s">And</a> then in regards to the public comment, so- Mayor, excuse me, could we just discuss one policy at a time?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15330.994s">Yes</a> I have my light on. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15333.236s">Yep</a> so I am you know I was just I guess I'm just having trouble like I feel like the public comment part and the agenda kind of go together and you know I'm just and I I tried watching the meeting I'm just I'm just a little bit confused because if I look at our current agenda we have <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15356.855s">On</a> our current agenda, currently what we have in this part of the policy, we have community participation, where it does say any citizen may be given permission to speak at the school committee meetings on any agenda item up to three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15372.162s">That's</a> always been on our agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15375.684s">Then</a> we have the public participation emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15379.405s">So</a> is this new policy public comment <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15386.008s">is</a> that replacing community participation? <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15391.169s">You</a> just changed the name of the word. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15392.93s">Instead</a> of saying community participation, it's now gonna be called public comment, but it's the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15401.472s">That's</a> where I'm just unsure about that.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15535.893s">It</a> does, like it sounds like you're separating it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15538.334s">And</a> so I guess I just want some clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15542.416s">So</a> can a resident, <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15545.711s">you</a> know, come, you know, before the podium at any point and just speak about something that's not on the agenda or... That's against the law, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15554.693s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15555.273s">So</a> that... Because that... It doesn't... In the new policy, it doesn't state any item... Okay, it does state any item on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15564.795s">All</a> right, the only other concern I had was... And I heard this before, a couple of meetings back, was that <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15573.675s">We</a> asked for the full Medford Street address. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15577.757s">And</a> so the concern is that what if a community member is displaced for whatever reason, whether they're homeless or in foster care, and they don't have a Medford resident address, you know, we specifically, you know, states that it must be a Medford Street address. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15598.488s">So</a> that was something that was brought to my attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15602.591s">you</a> know, a while back and I know you were working on these policies.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15750.73s">Thank</a> you, I would appreciate that, thank you.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15991.032s">Yes,</a> so I <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15995.529s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15995.809s">Van</a> der Kloot and myself, we have a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15998.591s">We</a> haven't got to that point yet on the agenda to have the meeting start at a scheduled time. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16007.138s">We</a> heard from community members, all of us, that they would like a designated time to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16015.345s">So</a> I know that what I've heard from the discussion was that you, during your subcommittee meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16025.029s">You</a> know, kind of talking about, you know, having the possibility of having a meeting start, you know, maybe five, six flexible with the superintendent, and I'm okay with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16035.875s">However,</a> what we've heard from the community is that, you know, I know that some of the reports that are presented, <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16045.931s">might</a> be for us, but some of the community, you know, enjoys, you know, being part of that, you know, discussion and hearing it and, you know, has kind of asked us to have the meeting start. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16058.419s">At</a> seven, which, you know, I tried to kind of go somewhere in the middle between six and seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16063.142s">And,</a> you know, I just kind of came up with the middle time of 630. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16067.064s">We've</a> started a couple of our meetings at 630. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16070.705s">You</a> know, I do the goal of all of our meetings is to not have them go, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16078.393s">hours</a> and hours, you know, that's definitely a goal and I know that that's what this plan is, you know, trying to do is trying to, you know, reduce the amount of time that our meetings are going by having a, you know, a consolidated agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16095.051s">So</a> I'm just, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16097.751s">I'm</a> just concerned where now, you know, we're going to have, which, and I'm totally in support of not having the presentations for the public until at, you know, after 7pm or after. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16111.603s">I</a> do agree with that so that people who are in work can go home, eat, you know, eat their dinner. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16117.708s">And</a> then if they want to either join on Zoom or they're going to come down to the chamber, they can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16124.193s">So</a> that's where I am with that because where I didn't, you know, I heard about your, um, I read, I'm sorry, not read, watched on YouTube after I had already done my resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16138.861s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16139.642s">So</a> it just was like, you know, the timing was like a coincidence, you know, I'm doing the resolution, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16144.745s">Bandicoot,</a> and then you were having a discussion, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16148.227s">So,</a> um, so, you know, I'm just, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16152.469s">You</a> know, I am definitely I start work very early. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16155.493s">I</a> know the administration does I know the teachers do and, you know, this is like my I don't know like 20th hour right now I'm losing my voice I can't think I'm, I have no voice you know it's just going. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16167.687s">So,</a> I. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16169.349s">and</a> definitely in support of having earlier meetings but at the same time you know it's our duty to serve the public and and that's what has been pointed out to me by you know some of the public that you know we used to do our meetings at seven we every meeting started at seven and then once we had the pandemic <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16190.984s">we</a> did kind of cut the, I mean, we started our meetings earlier because we were meeting earlier, but we went just as late. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16201.066s">Like</a> we started, some of our meetings started last year at four, but we still met until 11 o'clock at night, you know, even though we, so we, we, we started to trend towards an earlier hour, you know, so I'm wondering if, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16217.955s">if</a> maybe, like, if we could come up with a set time so that the community knows that we're going to be starting our meetings at a set time. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16225.181s">I'm</a> not gonna, you know, my resolution hasn't come up yet, so that's, you know, coming up in the future time, but we are talking about the gender at this time right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16235.048s">So</a> from reading this, I'm not sure, like, what time are the meetings gonna start? <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16240.152s">I'm</a> just curious myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16241.273s">Are</a> they, you know, it doesn't seem like it's going to be set here for a specific time.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16822.898s">and</a> try it and see how the public feels. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16832.063s">I'm</a> gonna have to abstain. <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16832.983s">I'm</a> sorry, I'm just not ready to do the vote right now.

everybody with the Building and Grounds Subcommittee folder. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2902.996s">I'm</a> gonna just summarize the meeting minutes very briefly. <a

href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2954.13s">It's</a> difficult to know where the front entrance is. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2956.53s">We</a> need an official sign. <a

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2465.802s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2466.423s">And</a> when do you think we'll get the appropriation from the municipal government? <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2471.266s">I</a> guess in the past, <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2473.416s">And</a> maybe I'm wrong, but I think in the past, we typically had the appropriation, like when we went into the final budget meeting, like we knew what we got for a number, but I could be just not remembering it correctly.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2521.468s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2658.752s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2659.232s">And</a> I said one follow up. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2660.253s">So</a> do you think it would be two weeks, three weeks, like where, you know, I'm just curious, like, I mean, you know, we don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2668.656s">So</a> I guess we'll just be waiting.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1672.439s">OK,</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1673.439s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1673.839s">And</a> I don't want to move along too quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1675.28s">So</a> I was just going to pause it right there for a moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1677.222s">And</a> now let me move on to the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1681.804s">And</a> I can make it a little bit bigger. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1683.265s">Let</a> me just see if it might be too small. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1685.907s">Let's</a> see. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1690.87s">It</a> can either be 100. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1691.49s">Oh,</a> zoom out. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1692.711s">Zoom</a> in. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1693.352s">Zoom</a> out. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1694.392s">Oh,</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1694.993s">Wrong</a> zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1701.327s">Yeah,</a> sorry, I think I did the wrong one. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1704.729s">Making</a> it smaller zoom in. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1706.77s">There</a> we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1707.31s">I'm</a> getting right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1708.19s">One</a> more time just to make it a little bigger. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1714.033s">OK,</a> this is much bigger. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1717.855s">OK,</a> so as you can see. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1721.236s">There.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1722.917s">They</a> look very similar, but I think it's just a different font. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1727.359s">So</a> here is number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1728.62s">And</a> then number two. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1737.968s">And</a> this is number three and four. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1743.392s">So</a> three and four look very similar. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1745.373s">You</a> know what the difference is? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1747.775s">Is</a> that the M is in the white on number three and the Medford, like the Mustang M is in the blue background on number four. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1757.162s">And</a> then five has the white background.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1763.788s">Okay,</a> okay, that's good. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1765.269s">So</a> as part of this, and I was going to ask, I don't know if Dr. Cushing was able to help, but what we were going to do was to do a poll, but I'm not sure if we're able to do something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1781.496s">I</a> know it was very last minute, so I just wanted to ask Dr. Cushing if that was something that we would be able to do, but if not, it's not a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1790.46s">It</a> was just something that I thought of very last minute, <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1794.362s">I</a> was at a meeting yesterday and we did a poll and on the zoom call and it was, you know, it was interactive and I said, Oh, maybe we could do that for this meeting tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1803.481s">And</a> there's number six. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1805.788s">It's</a> the blue, it looks, you know, with the Mustang traditional. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1810.07s">Number</a> seven, this is just the standard Mayford High School sign.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1834.183s">Oh</a> wow, that's really neat.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1838.606s">And</a> let's go to number eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1845.791s">And</a> this one looks very similar to number seven.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1853.036s">It</a> is a little different, just slightly different.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1858.681s">I</a> can see the line goes all the way across on number eight and it stops a little bit on number seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1865.243s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2001.061s">I</a> like the old logo. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2002.362s">Yes,</a> Mr. Russo?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2194.631s">So</a> Dr. Cushing has his hand raised, and I just wanted to mention that in this particular project, we're not renaming the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2204.601s">Medford</a> High School doesn't have a sign on the front entrance. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2208.424s">There's</a> no way to find the front of the school because there isn't a sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2214.691s">For</a> some reason, when the school was built, <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2217.253s">they</a> just never put a sign up. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2219.715s">I</a> had discussed this with John McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2221.776s">So</a> what we're doing today in the committee and what we spoke of in the last meeting was that we would like to have a sign to designate the front entrance of the Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2234.284s">So</a> we asked John McLaughlin to get some estimates. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2236.646s">So</a> some of the pictures that I shared were a little bit more in detail <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2241.789s">but</a> then we could just go with a simpler sign that just simply says Medford High School without a logo and just leave it like that and we could you know once you know the vision committee is formed in the future that sign can be taken off and then put <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2259.359s">in</a> another place in the new high school or the new renovated high school at some time in the future, which might not be for 10 or many years later. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2267.383s">So</a> I just wanted to provide that clarification about what we're talking about on this meeting agenda item. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2275.766s">But</a> Dr. Cushing, go ahead and then Mr. McLaughlin after that.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2413.834s">So</a> as part of this demonstration, I asked Dr. Cushing if he could help me with just launching a poll so that we can just get some feedback of preference for a sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2428.398s">So</a> I was going to do that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2431.038s">I</a> will click, launch the polling, and then I'm going to screen share again the signs so that everybody can see them again. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2438.34s">So</a> if you could just bear with me, I'm going to click on launch the polling. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2442.122s">And</a> this is just to get some feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2445.503s">Ultimately,</a> we'll have to bring this to the whole committee to hear what their thoughts are, but this is just a starting point to get to the next step. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2453.626s">So</a> hold on a moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2454.447s">I'm</a> going to click launch polling. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2455.627s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2457.348s">So</a> now I'm going to then click screen share and go back to the pictures. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2465.045s">So</a> if you, everybody, can you see the poll that's in progress right now?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2481.456s">Perfect,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2482.276s">Thank</a> you, Dr. Cushing.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2546.148s">I'm</a> sharing the pictures again. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2548.249s">Can</a> everybody see the pictures?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2553.471s">Okay,</a> perfect, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2554.391s">Mr.</a> McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2556.151s">I'm</a> going through them pretty quickly, but I'm gonna go back up again so you can see them again. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2560.993s">Just</a> thinking about what I like my reference to.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2575.645s">This</a> is number six.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2580.569s">I</a> should tell you, this is number seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2585.792s">This</a> is number eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2591.216s">This</a> is number nine. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2594.678s">Number</a> 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2597.68s">This</a> is number 11.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2601.623s">Yes,</a> of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2603.225s">Here</a> is one and two. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2604.586s">They</a> are on the same slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2606.688s">Show</a> one. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2607.609s">Very</a> similar. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2608.67s">I</a> have a hard time figuring out which is, I think they're both in my, the way I look at it, I can see they look the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2615.616s">And</a> here is four, here is three.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2621.1s">Three</a> is right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2622.341s">Oops,</a> sorry, I went too fast. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2624.583s">I</a> clicked off of it, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2625.964s">Wait,</a> here we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2628.026s">Three</a> has the white background for the logo M. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2632.786s">and</a> then four has the blue background, the logo, and five has the blue logo background with white from Everett High School.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2703.027s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2719.053s">Does</a> anybody need me to show the pictures? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2721.874s">Do</a> you want me to stop the screen share and everybody can take the poll?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2731.833s">Yes,</a> you may. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2732.493s">Yep,</a> let me get up to one and two. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2733.934s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2734.514s">Okay,</a> so here is one on top, two on the bottom.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2743.699s">It</a> looks like they are the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2745.801s">Yeah,</a> they look to be the same too. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2748.082s">I'm</a> looking for differences.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2750.503s">Yeah,</a> exactly, I think, yeah.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2753.565s">Yes,</a> the font, it must be the font. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2755.566s">Yes,</a> I do see it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2757.978s">what</a> it's like a little bit, you know, a milder font on number, it looks like on number two, a little bit more dramatic on number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2765.661s">Excuse</a> me. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2768.343s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2768.823s">And</a> then here is three, four, and five. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2774.745s">And</a> this is number six. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2778.327s">And</a> then this is number seven, number eight, number nine, <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2788.214s">And</a> number 10, and then, yep. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2793.817s">And</a> this is just, I think this was an extra one, number 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2798.319s">So</a> we just have the 10 of them on the poll.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2811.646s">So</a> I'm going to stop the screen share right now.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2816.968s">Okay,</a> let me do it again.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2822.47s">Let</a> me do this screen share again. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2823.971s">One</a> second. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2825.632s">Oh,</a> I'm disabled right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2826.832s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2827.292s">Dr.</a> Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2829.293s">Yeah,</a> no problem.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3129.672s">Okay,</a> excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3131.633s">So,</a> you know, the reason we did the poll was we wanted to kind of narrow down, you know, what type of sign would be preferable for Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3143.615s">As</a> part of this evening's agenda item, you know, as Dr. Cushing said, is that we want to kind of narrow down a price. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3152.177s">So</a> we want to have something very similar to what's showing in number six or possibly seven if we were going to share six and seven with the full committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3161.607s">So,</a> you know, I'm thinking, you know, in terms of figures, you know, like, let's say <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3171.535s">you</a> know, 15,000, like, I mean, I would like to hear some feedback from my committee members to put a sign on Medford High School that would be able to be transferable at some time in the future, you know, would that be something that I could, you know, we could possibly, you know, kind of decide on this evening or 15 to 20, you know,
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3234.258s">Yep,</a> yep. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3235.299s">So</a> I think what what I was trying to say and I'm sorry I didn't mean to say that I'm making the decision, I want to, I want to make a recommendation to the full committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3245.104s">So,</a> if we want to definitely move this project into the full committee for them to see both number six and seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3253.26s">And,</a> you know, I guess, you know, we can give the estimate that we currently have that Mr. McLaughlin has received from I believe it's from white. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3262.711s">That</a> was a picture from white lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3264.453s">Is</a> that correct, Mr. McLaughlin?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3266.835s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3267.156s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3267.716s">So</a> we have the estimate from white lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3270.72s">I'm</a> not sure exactly what <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3274.063s">you</a> know, estimate goes with number six and white estimate goes with number seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3278.245s">Would</a> you be able to tell us, Mr. McLaughlin, or would you have to reach out to them and you could get that by the next year?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3370.821s">I</a> just kind of- I love that idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3372.223s">You</a> know? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3372.543s">Yes,</a> I think that's wonderful.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3467.845s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3468.285s">So,</a> so for, for this, then we, are we, is there like a recommendation to have Dr. Cushing do a poll with the student body with the three top signs and <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3482.079s">Um,</a> Mr. McLaughlin, would you be able to, um, reach out to, um, you know, the carpentry construction craft labor, Mr. Fallon and, um, the, um, you know, graphic arts to see if it would be something that they would be able to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3499.23s">And,</a> you know, if it's definitely not, then we still have, you know, the sign estimate that we got. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3506.015s">And</a> then once we gather all that information, um, you know, we can then <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3511.616s">you</a> know, have another, I guess, another meeting at another subcommittee meeting to talk about the feedback.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3545.535s">Okay,</a> so at this point, we're going to keep this in subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3549.496s">Is</a> that what I'm hearing from my committee members? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3554.458s">Say</a> that again, Kathy? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3556.019s">Are</a> we going to keep this item in subcommittee at this time until we get the poll from the student body, <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3564.94s">and</a> just clarification from construction and craft labor and graphic arts.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3611.137s">I</a> think that's what I was hearing from some, I mean, some of my committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3616.701s">I</a> was, you know, I was asking for, you know, a ballpark figure, but it seems as though, you know, from what I heard was that maybe, <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3628.88s">more</a> exploration. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3630.101s">I</a> would be amenable to having it ready for the first day of school, if we can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3638.927s">And</a> we can maybe get the polling information from the student body and have it ready for the June 14th meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3647.232s">And</a> we could share out the results with the full committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3650.794s">I</a> would really like to really move forward with this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3658.767s">you</a> know, I would like to make a motion to do something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3662.849s">So</a> motion to get the polling from the student body, Don McLaughlin reach out to just, you know, find out for sure, can construction craft labor do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3672.812s">Yes</a> or no, you know, with graphic arts, Mr. Fallon, he did speak already. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3678.274s">And</a> he mentioned that it was out of his realm with what they could do, but maybe there are some things that they can do that could cut some costs.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3756.565s">So</a> Dr. Cushing, do you think it's possible to get the polling done before the June 14 meeting?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3790.167s">And</a> then we can just, you know, I'd like to just motion that we, um, to, to show the committee members, um, the sign ideas that we've, you know, visited this evening and we can hear their thoughts and we can share the results from the student body poll. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3804.473s">And</a> we can talk about the pricing estimates that we received, which will, you know, um, and we can go from there and Mr. McLaughlin, anything that you can find out any additional information, you know, please, you know, let me know, reach out to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3816.917s">Um,</a> I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3818.785s">So</a> is there a second on that motion to share this with the full committee on our June 14th meeting?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3830.095s">And</a> so I'm going to take the roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3833.958s">Mr.</a> Russo? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3835.359s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3837.201s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3837.381s">Van</a> De Kloet?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3839.282s">And</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3839.723s">Kreatz?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3840.123s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3840.704s">So</a> we have three in the affirmative and zero in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3844.247s">So</a> the motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3845.428s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3846.382s">Okay,</a> so we're going to move on to the next. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3848.623s">And</a> the next discussion was just john McLaughlin was just going to go over some of the work that they did on the front entrance to just, you know, kind of rejuvenate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3860.227s">Mr.</a> McLaughlin, if you could go over that.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4045.545s">Yeah,</a> thank you, Mr. McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4046.826s">And</a> Dr. Cushing, I do have the pictures that John shared with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4050.587s">Would</a> I be able to do the screen share again? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4052.388s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4063.163s">Okay,</a> and so these are the pictures that Mr. McLaughlin sent to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4067.384s">I</a> think there's just the one here that I brought up right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4071.724s">That's</a> one angle. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4073.965s">Let</a> me go here. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4075.805s">It</a> looks absolutely beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4078.025s">I</a> couldn't believe it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4078.946s">Oh,</a> we're gonna get to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4080.346s">Sorry,</a> I'm ahead of myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4082.386s">So</a> that's one angle. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4083.926s">There's</a> three just different angles, but it looks so beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4087.907s">I</a> can't believe it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4089.327s">And</a> let me just bring up another one. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4091.488s">Hold</a> on one moment here. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4101.125s">Oh,</a> here we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4103.467s">Okay,</a> so this is one of the picture here. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4105.769s">This</a> is all three of them together. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4107.03s">Okay,</a> very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4107.85s">Okay,</a> so what you can see is there was right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4111.493s">I'm</a> kind of like with my mouse showing you there was a broken fence and we reached out to the mayor's office and the city engineer's office and I believe the DPW was able to <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4124.03s">help</a> assist with that and get that section of the fence broken. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4129.114s">That</a> was broken.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4148.57s">Thanks,</a> Maggie. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4150.14s">Thank</a> you, Aggie, I see you on the call here and I have to, I keep on doing this with the pictures. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4155.563s">Wrong</a> picture up again. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4158.084s">And</a> thank you, Aggie, for everything that you did to help with this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4161.846s">I</a> know we were emailing and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4164.307s">Montello,</a> I don't know if she's on the call, but she was extremely helpful and she brought this to my attention and she said, there's a very nice, easy, quick way that we can beautify the front entrance corner would be by fixing that broken, <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4179.015s">fence</a> section and then just, you know, beautifying it a little bit with some, you know, like with the mulch or with some fresh plants. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4185.878s">And</a> it looks beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4187.659s">I</a> really think it looks absolutely beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4190.0s">When</a> I saw the pictures today, I couldn't believe it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4192.021s">I</a> said, oh my gosh, it looks so nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4195.382s">And</a> then I was doing a little bit of Googling myself and, you know, because we have, you know, a lot of the same situations that we have at the high school at my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4204.246s">We</a> don't have much irrigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4205.907s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4206.722s">You</a> know, it looks nice and I think some low maintenance, natural looking flowers, you know, they look really nice and I'm hoping that we can keep it looking that nice where it's like the front entrance, everybody sees it and it's the first thing they see when they come to our school. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4221.706s">So</a> I'm so happy with all the work and all the help that we got on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4225.968s">Thank</a> you, Mr. McLaughlin and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4228.068s">Agitudin,</a> thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4229.429s">I</a> really appreciate all your help.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4561.99s">Are</a> there any more questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4563.911s">It's</a> 6.17. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4565.191s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4565.992s">Thank</a> you so much, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4566.812s">Tootie.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4567.192s">I</a> really appreciate you, I'm sorry, Aggie, for being on the call today. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4570.894s">I</a> really appreciate everything that you did. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4572.554s">And</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4572.874s">McLaughlin,</a> thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4574.155s">And</a> so, yep, so we're gonna be moving on to agenda item number seven, Medford High School restrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4580.517s">So</a> we spoke about this over several meetings and the mayor had made a, <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4588.016s">resolution</a> on the February meeting that she would like to have the high school bathroom project started. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4597.544s">So</a> I wanted to know, where are we with this project? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4602.108s">And</a> did the bathrooms go out for RFP, the ones that we voted on to get rehabilitated go out for RFP?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4665.973s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4667.133s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4667.653s">Because</a> I do want to make sure that, you know, ideally it would be, <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4672.754s">ideal</a> if we could have the work done over the summer while the students aren't in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4678.275s">And</a> I understand there's a lot going on and it's your first budget year and it's just, I can't believe how fast time's flying and it's already the end of the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4690.378s">So</a> I really appreciate if we can get the RFP out as soon as possible so that we can get the work going over the summer months.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=5355.298s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=5356.179s">And</a> I agree, it's something that we have to act on and I'm ready to make a motion that we proceed with the replacement of the Medford High School hot water system. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=5367.888s">And</a> we're gonna move this project over to our sub regular meeting for a full committee vote.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=5433.044s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=5434.305s">Do</a> any of my committee members have any questions for Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=5437.747s">Alicia</a> Hunt or Mr. McLaughlin?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=5446.615s">So</a> I made a motion that we proceed with the replacement of the hot water system. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=5451.357s">So</a> what we do need to do is we need to vote on this in subcommittee so that the full committee can vote on it at our next regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=5460.32s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=5460.98s">So</a> that they can, you know, so they need our full committee vote to go ahead with the marching orders to replace the hot water system. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=5468.917s">And</a> it is, you know, as Miss Alicia said, it's an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=5472.898s">We</a> have to have it replaced by August, mid-August. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=5476.479s">So</a> we have to, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=5479.3s">So</a> I second your motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=5481.24s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=5482.221s">And</a> so, yes, go ahead, Mr. Ruscio.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=5659.929s">Yes,</a> and I think Mr. Murphy, I'm not sure if you're there, but I know that we don't need to vote to send it out for RFP. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=5668.794s">We</a> don't need to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=5670.195s">But</a> I believe that we do need to vote to approve the spending of this repair, replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=5679.9s">but</a> I could be wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=5680.761s">So,</a> Mr. Murphy.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=5701.968s">Yes,</a> so do we, okay, do we need the full committee vote to go ahead with the replacement of the hot water system or can we vote it tonight and then the work can begin before the June 7th meeting as soon as the specifications are available with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=5719.799s">Hunt's</a> office?

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8719.976s">Okay,</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8720.236s">Van's</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8721.397s">Yeah,</a> you know, just following the guidance from the governor and, you know, seeing that the city council is back in chambers and, you know, we do have the capability to have, you know, a hybrid model where we could have the Zoom on at the same time and have members in chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8742.409s">And</a> of course, if members can't come to chambers, they could still join the <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8747.149s">meeting</a> via zoom and that's what the city council was doing and um it worked you know very well i watched a couple of meetings and you know um you know the the screen was there you could hear the members who were calling from home and they were visible they were clear and um the audience could still be on zoom and participate um i think it's a good idea now that <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8772.359s">you</a> know, with the reopening and with a lot of the restrictions being lifted, you know, we've been hearing from a lot of community members that they would like to see the school committee back in chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8787.191s">I'll</a> turn it over to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8787.912s">Van</a> de Koop.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8995.867s">Yes,</a> so I wanted to know because I wasn't sure how it would be handled. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9000.149s">So,</a> um, you know, this was before the code. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9004.572s">Um,</a> you know, we had Mr. McLaughlin was was doing our meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9009.254s">So,</a> you know, I think that, you know, we'll have to work out the technical piece of who is going to cover our meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9016.778s">you</a> know, when we do go back to chambers and who's going to be covering the meeting and the Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9023.98s">I</a> know Mr. Dr. Cushing has been doing the Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9027.241s">So,</a> you know, I don't know the mechanics and working those details out. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9032.662s">That</a> was something that, you know, I wanted to bring up. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9036.704s">I</a> don't know what details, you know, are going to be covered by whom or whoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9042.345s">and</a> then also at the same time if any of the committee members have any like medical reasons why they wouldn't need to wear a mask or they wouldn't be able to wear a mask um would the medical like would that committee member be able to you know remove the mask in the chambers um in between the barricade because i know that they have the glass petitions and um <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9069.603s">you</a> know, to keep the distance and the glass petitions so that if the committee member is like vaccinated and has difficulty breathing and has a medical note, can that person remove their mask with that or would that person have to go on the remote call?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9097.89s">And</a> would that be the same for being in the committee of the whole, so the subcommittee, if they were in those separate rooms? <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9107.834s">Because</a> I know that the governor did say that all of the restrictions would be over once June 15th, like the number of people attending meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9120.36s">So</a> yeah, okay.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9192.687s">Yeah,</a> I didn't take my hand down, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9195.152s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9196.294s">Member</a> Van der Kloot?<h2><a href="../2021-05-19_-zTfqlt_PDw/2021-05-19_-zTfqlt_PDw.html">May 19, 2021 - Budget Meeting:  Central Office and Wrap Up</a></h2>

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6554.746s">Oh,</a> okay, there we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6556.227s">Yes,</a> so in regards to the motion that we made this evening, will that be for, Mr. Murphy's going to get us a report that will outline what the various costs would be, like whether or not we're gonna go with yellow buses for all the students in the district, or we're gonna consider purchasing MBTA bus passes for all the students? <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6581.671s">Is</a> that the way, is this going to be a proposal that's gonna be ready for us to review at the time of the budget and we can see how it fits into the budget?

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3945.387s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3946.508s">Thank</a> you for the reports, and it's been a great presentation so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3951.11s">So</a> I was looking at the details that we got in the draft recommendations for the elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3957.233s">I'll</a> just start with the elementary schools first. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3959.974s">And</a> something that caught my attention was <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3963.711s">under</a> the additional budgetary priorities, it was listed, three of the elementary schools have listed a water filling station. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3974.599s">and</a> procurement of additional playground equipment to coincide with plans for additional organized play and social engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3981.705s">So</a> my first question for the water filling station is I think that's a fantastic idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3988.11s">I</a> definitely think it's more sanitary to have water filling stations where they can't go to the bubbler and they need to fill their bottles. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=3997.477s">So</a> is that something that we are going to get funding from COVID funds and we could wait and we you know to get that funding and then maybe possibly install additional water filling stations at each of the schools in the entire district?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4231.72s">It</a> was in the same section. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4234.101s">And</a> I was just curious what the additional playground equipment was that coincides with the play and social engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4242.082s">So</a> that's something that stuck out that, is that something that we need to do for the playgrounds that's related to COVID so that the children can play <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4253.238s">keeping</a> socially distant. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4255.079s">Yeah,</a> I was just really curious about that where I have my upcoming school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4259.101s">Is</a> that something we should be discussing where, you know, we are in COVID, if everybody's going back to school, I'm just very curious what is the additional playground equipment that would be needed for the social engagement?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4575.534s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4575.954s">Thank</a> you very much, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4576.774s">Kay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4576.934s">That</a> was really helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4578.015s">And</a> I hope that we can get some of these items so that the children, when they get back, you know, in the fall can, you know, participate in these different rotations. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4587.616s">It</a> sounds like a lot of fun and I love that they're arguing less and they're getting more exercise and probably just enjoying their time out and getting the fresh air. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4597.538s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5929.997s">Yes,</a> I had a question and I know it's it's a personal priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5935.042s">It's</a> in regards to the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5937.745s">It</a> was something that seemed concerning to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5941.228s">It's</a> it's noted here that the method vocational school is not currently part of the cleaning contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5947.194s">with</a> the school and they are requesting additional allocation of funds to ensure that all the CTE vocational shop spaces are included. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5958.06s">So</a> that seemed concerning to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5959.961s">How</a> are the other classrooms getting cleaned if they're not part of the cleaning contract?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6134.026s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6134.287s">And</a> I would like that too, Chad. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6135.688s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6135.928s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6136.849s">And,</a> um, you know, I really, you know, I hope that we can allocate some additional funding so that we can, we can take care of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6144.314s">Um,</a> it's very important that we do that, you know, especially during the COVID times, you know, we, we just need to make sure that, you know, the classrooms and the CT shops are getting just, you know, sanitized every day.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6213.596s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6214.877s">Thank</a> you both. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6215.518s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=7584.714s">Yes,</a> so I just have a follow up question. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=7587.956s">So,</a> you know, just looking at these numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=7590.657s">So,</a> if the motion that's put forth right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=7595.619s">we're</a> going to account for like let's say the Brooks has $140,000 here and then I go to the um I'm just going to quickly go to the other page one second here 140,000 so are we is this vote to allocate <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=7614.333s">the</a> total of the funds in all the different categories right now this evening not knowing what the appropriation is for this upcoming school year i guess i'm a little confused or or we already know that the covid mitigation funds are going to come out of the essar and mr murphy is going to identify <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=7639.45s">what's</a> what we would be able to do so for example like support staff in transportation needs for the extended school day you know that's definitely something i want um i guess i'm a little confused about what we're voting on yeah i think i take the motion to mean that as we move toward may 19th the committee is endorsing the priorities that have been articulated to them this evening and so as we get to may 19th we have greater guidance with regard to the<h2><a href="../2021-04-26_6kKbcFkpEqA/2021-04-26_6kKbcFkpEqA.html">4.26.2021 Regular School Committee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=567.883s">Chris</a> Oh, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=569.925s">Um</a> I just wanted to say that, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=572.887s">And</a> sometimes I haven't been able to speak at some of the meetings because. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=576.989s">Some</a> other committee members have gone on to their questions, and I'm looking at the clock and I'm looking at the number of residents that want to speak, and I just you know, I just passed on my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=587.336s">Um</a> so I you know, it would be helpful if we all you <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=596.101s">Then</a> before they got to ask their second question, it could go through maybe with some of the other members if they had a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=604.928s">In</a> the past, I have expressed that I'm not in favor of more frequent meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=610.492s">I</a> know that it sounds like it would be helpful, but I found that <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=616.457s">some</a> of the details in the meetings that we have, they're very comprehensive and meeting every week and doing the minutes and posting the meetings, it's going to ultimately take the same amount of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=629.225s">And</a> the administration is just gonna be getting ready for meetings every single week. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=634.308s">So</a> I'm not in favor of meeting more frequently and adding on more frequent, shorter meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=641.952s">I</a> just wanted to say that.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7710.196s">I</a> had the same concerns about the date where, you know, going back to school, the first day of school starts, I believe I just saw on the calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7718.942s">I</a> think it was like August 30th or it could be August 31st. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7723.625s">I'm</a> thinking that we're just getting the kids ready to get back in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7727.187s">It's</a> teacher induction week and it just seems the timing, the date, September 1st, seems a little bit too close to the start of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7738.274s">I</a> also wanted to ask the superintendent or the administration, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7742.276s">if</a> they felt that date was doable, you know, even just to get the comprehensive list, which will still maybe take some time where they're working throughout the summer, getting everything ready for back to school and getting the kids back to school, you know, for the beginning of the fall.<h2><a href="../2021-04-12_tLacBRpCBlE/2021-04-12_tLacBRpCBlE.html">SCHOOL COMMITTEE MEETING</a></h2>

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=680.341s">Member</a> Kreatz? <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=681.662s">Yes,</a> so when we had our meeting for the building and ground subcommittee meeting, we had voted to <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=691.027s">to</a> make sure that the generator in Mifflin High School was a priority item on the upcoming capital improvement plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=697.933s">I</a> don't see that here. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=700.836s">And,</a> you know, what I recall from our meeting was that during our discussion about the front entrance, that it was recommended by <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=712.803s">Mr.</a> Chris Andreessen, who is an architect that currently, legally, we would either leave it as is or have to do the whole project. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=721.87s">And</a> we would need to hire, I guess, a structural engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=726.874s">I</a> think that's what he said. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=730.177s">So</a> I was just curious about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=733.339s">Did</a> anything change? <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=735.281s">Did</a> we get a new estimate on that work?

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2888.639s">The</a> other question is separate. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2890.86s">So</a> on the city's project list for the capital improvement plan, it lists the Curtis burner, you know, as needing to get replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2902.122s">So</a> I didn't know if like that was something that that. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2907.726s">is</a> maybe should be on the capital improvement plan where it's on the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2912.308s">It's</a> listed with the amount of money that's, you know, the $816,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2916.369s">Let</a> me just, I'm just trying to find, I think it's on page 38 of the capital, the city's plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2925.452s">Just</a> getting there right now.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2935.092s">Yeah,</a> so when I looked at the city's project, it says for schools, the one item for 2021, it says 816,183. <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2943.835s">It</a> has rehab, MHS bathrooms, replace boiler, ADA accessibility upgrades, security upgrades at Medford High School, repair, replace boiler at CTHS, which is Curtis Tufts High School.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1894.845s">Yes,</a> I did have one more, and this came up last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1899.751s">So</a> when we got the pre-budget materials, <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1906.736s">And</a> it happened a lot last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1908.357s">They</a> came the same day as the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1913.279s">And</a> I, you know, unfortunately I work in the day and a few other committee members do and I didn't even get a chance to look at the materials before the meeting, and it was a little different because our meetings were at four. <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1923.923s">So,</a> and they were on the same night as the school committee meeting so you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1928.365s">If,</a> if possible, can we get the materials for the pre budget materials, you know, in advance, you know, at least 24 hours in advance, and then after that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1943.253s">at</a> the end of that week, because I can see we have three meetings in one week. <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1947.095s">So</a> at the end of that week, if we can get those materials sent to our homes so that we can have the hard copy, because it was very difficult to keep on going back and forth, back and forth, like, where was that email? <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1964.225s">Where</a> did that go? <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1966.254s">It</a> was very, it was very difficult to go back and just look at the information about the pre budget because when it when we got to the budget, you know, you had to like scramble, where did that go where was it put, you know, and, and also maybe have a folder on the shared drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1985.441s">specifically</a> to put the pre-budget materials in, you know, like call it, you know, pre-budget materials, and then they would be in there like labeled elementary education, secondary, and so on, so that some colleagues like to have the online version, and for something like this, <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2005.645s">I</a> always like to have the printed version, and I don't have a printer that's really good at my house that I can print the materials, so it's challenging for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2016.475s">And</a> I'm not sure if everybody's in the same boat. <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2019.117s">I</a> mean, some people don't want paper at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2022.08s">even</a> if we could reach out at our next meeting and just ask colleagues how they feel about do they want a printed copy, yes or no? <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2030.965s">And</a> then maybe only those committee members who need a printed copy can get a printed copy after the meeting's presented at the end of the week so that they have it going into the budget meetings.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2207.617s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2244.934s">Yes.</a> <h2><a href="../2021-03-11_TjgvMpuq30w/2021-03-11_TjgvMpuq30w.html">Committee of the Whole - Columbus School Naming Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=258.037s">I</a> just wanted to thank Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=259.718s">Stone</a> for sharing that history with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=261.978s">And</a> I concur with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=264.119s">Vanderkoot.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=264.879s">You</a> know, I'm not ready to make a decision, and I do feel that this process should be a public process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=273.402s">You</a> know, from many of the community members that I've heard, you know, since June of 2020, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=280.342s">You</a> know, we, we've been waiting for this meeting, so that we could have the public engage and, you know, ask questions and share their opinions, but I do think that that name is, you know, would be is a good suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=296.992s">Um,</a> once we come up with the plans for choosing the names process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=302.015s">Um,</a> so I just wanted to share that information and I just want to ask the mayor a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=306.598s">So</a> mayor, I just had a question because I had a motion, you know, in regards to the two resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=313.763s">Should</a> I hold off and wait till we get to that part of the meeting?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=345.498s">So</a> I have a motion that is in regards to the entire timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=351.645s">So</a> I'm wondering if I should just read that now and if it could be considered, you know, as a, you know, in a recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=364.208s">It</a> should probably take me about two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=367.993s">So,</a> in my opinion, the deadlines in the meeting dates that were outlined in both resolutions are too tight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=375.244s">The</a> original resolution on June 15 stated specific dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=379.69s">You</a> know July 121 was when the school was going to be renamed, and then there was supposed to be a committee of the whole on September 1, and that's where we are right now we're, we're at the committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=392.859s">And</a> after that, October 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=397.142s">the</a> advisory committee was supposed to be formed, and then they would have been meeting October, November, December, January, and they would have submitted a new name to us by January 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=410.907s">Because</a> we're in the global pandemic, three of the four deadlines were missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=416.089s">So</a> I think we should take a step back today. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=418.91s">Today</a> marks one year into the coronavirus pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=423.032s">And</a> the Commissioner of Education has stated that the schools must be open for full-time in-person learning on April 5, while middle school will be required to do so on April 28. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=434.207s">Our</a> paramount focus should be planning to get the children, teachers, and staff back to school safely to receive the best education, having a budget to accommodate those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=444.234s">I</a> think that this should be our priority right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=447.996s">Also,</a> due to the magnitude of the change, I have recommended a slightly different timeline because in the original resolution, it was stated that the advisory committee should have a term of six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=464.307s">So</a> if I go back to the original timeline, the dates were September 1st, October 1st, November, December, January, February. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=474.636s">So</a> that was the six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=476.698s">So</a> here we are today on April, I'm sorry, not April, March 10th, and we are meeting for the rescheduled September 1st meeting, which was the committee of the whole to plan the structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=489.52s">And</a> we're still in the global pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=491.782s">So</a> then the next meeting, which would be the advisory committee would have been formed would be in April this coming April, which was, you know, according to the original resolution was exactly one month after the committee of the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=507.659s">So</a> that would bring us to April 10th. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=510.001s">But</a> I happen to think that April 10th is a little too soon to form the advisory committee, so I was thinking like April 30th would be a good time to form the advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=521.644s">And</a> then that would give the advisory committee April, then May, June, July and August are summer months, so we have to exclude those months, September, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=532.066s">October</a> happens to be Italian American Heritage Month, and we celebrate, you know, Columbus Day, which is a federal holiday, so I'm not sure if we want to include that month for the research or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=546.457s">And</a> then that would put our timeline up to November 2021, where the advisory committee would have the full six months, not including the summer months. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=556.966s">It</a> could be shorter if the committee wanted to meet during the summer months of July and August. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=562.871s">It</a> all depends on whether or not they would meet, which would mean the advisory committee would be coming to us either if we <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=570.797s">include</a> the summer months they would be coming to us September to bring the new research name or November to bring the new research name and this would give ample time and you know for the advisory committee to have a thoughtful reflective discussions to thoroughly research a new name. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=590.824s">So</a> this is the motion that I'm making to extend the timeline that was detailed in the in the <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=598.789s">The</a> plan that we're working on right now is still working off of the dates that were in the original resolution, but the three dates have already been missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=611.931s">So</a> that's my resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=613.992s">My</a> motion is to extend the timeline detailed in forming the advisory committee and pushing out the dates a little further so that the advisory committee can have six months as detailed in the original resolution.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1165.603s">Mayor,</a> I just wanted to... Mayor, I just heard from iPhone X, and I guess he was trying to unmute, but he couldn't unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1175.046s">Would</a> you be able to try him again?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3170.874s">member</a> Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3171.995s">Yes,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3173.036s">Um,</a> yep. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3173.956s">So</a> I wanted to amend that date because I know that the superintendent we are meeting tonight and the superintendent does her weekly updates every Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3185.184s">So</a> and she's meeting this week in particular, um, with Jesse, you know, to gather the information, um, you know, and provide updates to the community on <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3195.891s">you</a> know, what's going to be, you know, details for reopening schools and getting the children back into school safely. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3204.278s">So</a> I feel as though two days from now is a little too soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3208.922s">So</a> I wanted to amend that date to at the earliest if possible, like Monday or the following Friday, so that that's my amendment, either Monday the 15th, I believe, or Friday the 19th.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6429.054s">Can</a> we just go back up a little bit? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6430.755s">I</a> can't see some of the screen.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6438.36s">Yes,</a> if you could maybe just try to increase it up to 125 maybe. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6443.49s">Perfect,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6448.202s">I'm</a> just taking a few more moments to read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6450.327s">Sorry,</a> I'll be right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6452.031s">Take</a> your time, Member Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6521.125s">I</a> do have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6524.907s">Mayor,</a> I just have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6526.688s">Yes,</a> Member Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6527.928s">Yes,</a> I know I'm looking at Paulette's, you know, her, her resolution, and she does have the application form and suggestion will be posted and communicated out to usual mechanisms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6542.805s">including</a> translations. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6544.106s">Okay,</a> that's number two. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6544.867s">I'm</a> sorry, I'm just reading the wrong paragraph. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6546.828s">The</a> application will clearly state that interpretation services will be available to any community member who so requests and technology, laptop, camera, microphone will also be provided. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6559.758s">I'm</a> not seeing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6562.139s">Okay,</a> so there, okay, there it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6563.781s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7718.249s">respond.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7718.889s">Member</a> Kreatz? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7720.67s">Yes,</a> so I completely agree with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7724.491s">Van</a> der Kloot and I strongly believe that all the names must go to the advisory committee and that committee will thoroughly research those names. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7738.416s">They're</a> going to have to Google, maybe go to the library, break up into groups, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7745.399s">That's</a> what I believe the committee is being formed to do, to research all the names, to come up with the best name for our community, and it should be the community which is formed via the committee that's researching these names. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7764.46s">So</a> I motioned to accept the resolution the way it was put forth by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7771.242s">Van</a> der Kloot, where the advisory committee will be formed and will receive all the names. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7776.944s">Yes,</a> maybe we could get a copy of the names so that we can also just review them and be familiar with the names that were submitted as suggested names. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7786.307s">But</a> the process of researching and thoroughly <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7791.969s">you</a> know, reflecting on these names and taking into consideration, you know, everything that's going on in our community, um, just from what we heard this evening, it's, it's very, very important that the community, which is comprised of the advisory committee is part of the process and doing the selection. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7813.345s">You</a> know, the entire, if we get 300 names, I believe, yes, they should get all of those names.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7879.244s">Yes,</a> I did motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7880.865s">I</a> didn't hear a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7882.725s">That</a> was a second by member. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7885.466s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7886.147s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7886.467s">I</a> didn't hear it either. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7887.567s">Okay,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7922.001s">Okay,</a> I'm just hold on one minute.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13474.979s">Hi,</a> can you hear me because it is work I can hear it on my test. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13479.915s">We</a> can hear you now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13480.876s">We're</a> back. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13482.837s">Okay,</a> all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13484.118s">So</a> I had, when Paulette had shared her resolution, I reached out to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13490.002s">Van</a> der Kloot to just let her know that I felt the same way, that I don't think it should be exclusive to the CCSR. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13496.767s">I</a> think it should be open to high school students. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13500.229s">And</a> I felt the same way, and possibly maybe a backup student, whereas we do have two, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13509.535s">high</a> school students that serve on our committee and they take turns. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13515.101s">So</a> what if, because where it is high school and it's the end of the year and there's finals and things like that, it might be busy with the schedules that they might have. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13526.893s">So</a> I feel like it might, even if we picked two students, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13531.957s">they</a> might not be able to make all the meetings, but they might, you know, one of them might be able to make a meeting and they could, you know, kind of like go back and forth or come up with a schedule that works for both of them.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13797.054s">I</a> have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13799.605s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13800.306s">So,</a> I, I actually think that, you know, we should really amend this to be more of like number two specifically, and we're at the end, you know, having a lottery selection. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13814.577s">I</a> feel that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13817.719s">we</a> shouldn't be involved in selecting the applicants. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13822.2s">It</a> should those applicants in that section there with the other section at the end should be done via the lottery system where when the applications are sent in there would be a box where somebody could check off <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13839.286s">the</a> Racial Equity Task Force, South Medford Community, Medford Historian or Historical Society, CPAC, Italian Alliance, Italian American. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13851.6s">So</a> I feel like <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13854.005s">you</a> know, the lottery is the most equitable process where it's not going to be a human, you know, looking at that application. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13864.97s">There</a> could be room for bias making those selections, you know, to that advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13871.012s">So</a> I just, I felt as though there needs to be <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13875.134s">a</a> larger number for the lottery selection and in order to do that we would you know have to remove the school committee making a selection for the applicants similar to what we do for the middle school lottery selection where um where the students are put into a lottery and it's it's selected you know via the lottery selection process i think that's worth um
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14505.799s">I</a> would just like to make a point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14508.301s">There</a> is still potential room for some bias in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14514.925s">In</a> order to make it equitable, I feel as though removing the school committee from the process is the most equitable way to ensure it's a diverse committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14526.253s">So</a> if it's not going to be done via the lottery, there has to be <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14531.576s">Somebody</a> that's overseeing or ensuring that it's a diverse committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14536.44s">I'll</a> just give an example um, we just recently in september disbanded the vision committee because it wasn't a diverse committee, so That's something that could happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14549.272s">We're</a> all going to be going through these applications and We have all the same applications and you know <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14558.712s">you</a> know, there's room for human error, making that selection, you know, there's room for emotion, making that selection, you know, choosing that candidate. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14571.581s">I</a> just think, you know, it should be, if it's not gonna be done via the lottery, then I agree with the mayor, it would be part of the administration team, you know, to review the applications.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14915.02s">I</a> would be okay with that resolution, what's proposed by the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14919.022s">I</a> just really think that there is too much room for bias in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14925.926s">It</a> would be okay if we went through and we gave our top 10 and then the final decision would come from the administration so that, you know, I didn't handpick, you know, X, Y, Z, you know, to fit my, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14940.154s">you</a> know, what I wanted. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14941.855s">I</a> just, you know, I just really, and I want to have a diverse committee because we recently just disbanded the visionary committee and we haven't begun that process to start the application process for that committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14955.839s">So</a> I just feel it's really important that we get a diverse group of candidates, equitable.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17987.947s">Well,</a> I wanted to get some clarification, because I thought Mr. Russo said that we couldn't do a lottery as per our policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17995.993s">So</a> I was going to ask, I thought we couldn't do a lottery, but then I'm seeing the lottery is still in the application process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18004.919s">Well,</a> we can take it out.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18047.757s">I</a> agree to the lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18049.859s">I</a> think that maybe one member, one, the school committee would select one applicant each and then the additional applicants would then go into the lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18063.771s">So</a> that might be maybe a total of six lottery and each school committee member picking an applicant.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18105.146s">I</a> think it's going to be closer to 20 because we are giving them such a big task to do all the research. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18117.958s">And</a> based on the current timeline, I've already put my resolution out there for extending the timeline so that they can do the thoughtful discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18130.911s">The</a> way that it's detailed now in such a short amount of time, I think that there would need to be additional members to do the additional research with, you know, to thoroughly, you know, pick those names.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19724.315s">Mayor</a> Kathy Kreatz is trying to remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19728.738s">Yes,</a> I just wanted to chime in. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19730.119s">So</a> I do like the idea of having even a survey for the community so that they can give us some feedback once we have the three final names. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19745.035s">I</a> think it's really important that we involve the community somehow in this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19752.08s">So</a> I think that's a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19753.341s">I</a> think I like the idea of the students at the same time, I just wanna make sure that we're involving the entire community, you know, and including the students in the community in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19765.529s">It's</a> just something that it's just such a, you know, big responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19771.873s">I'm</a> just getting exhausted, sorry.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20595.534s">Yes,</a> so I'm just really uncomfortable and I wouldn't be able to approve the date, the May 24th. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20610.481s">I</a> just feel that it's too rushed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20613.148s">You</a> know, I mentioned that at the beginning of the meeting when I, you know, detailed the timeline, this advisory committee in the resolution that was originally stated was supposed to have a term of six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20629.297s">So</a> now we're condensing the six months into about eight weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20634.12s">And</a> so I'm just, I mean, I would ask my committee members if they would consider changing that date
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20662.398s">I</a> still think it's too soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20665.689s">You</a> know, I mean, I read the original resolutions that were presented in June, and it clearly stated the advisory committee will have a six-month term so that, you know, in my opinion, that would be ample time for the committee to <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20688.871s">to</a> have thoughtful, reflective discussions, get the survey results, read the survey results, thoroughly research for the new name. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20700.444s">this</a> is, you know, we're rushing to get the new name on May 24th. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20704.205s">You</a> know, we're not, in this particular meeting, we're not changing the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20711.506s">And</a> I get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20713.147s">I'm</a> just, you know, I just think it's too short of a timeframe. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20717.928s">That</a> that's my opinion.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20788.015s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20791.329s">I'm</a> not in favor of a temporary name. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20794.11s">We're</a> forming this advisory committee so that they can come up with a name. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20797.432s">I</a> just don't understand some of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20803.174s">And</a> that's not in the resolution that I went back to the original resolution and it didn't state that <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20812.287s">The</a> name would have to take on a temporary name. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20816.67s">If</a> a name wasn't decided by July 1 in keeping in mind that this is a pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20825.786s">And</a> all the deadlines that occurred all year everywhere, everything changed and got slid and extended and delayed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20837.111s">So</a> I'm just, you know, I wouldn't be happy with the way that the resolution in this section is written with the strict timeframe. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20847.636s">And</a> that's my opinion.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21254.953s">I</a> agree with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21255.933s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21256.453s">I've</a> already stated that I think the timeline, you know, the date, all the other dates were missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21264.176s">And</a> they were missed because we're in a pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21267.277s">In</a> the original resolution, it does say <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21271.383s">that</a> the advisory committee will have six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21275.344s">So</a> this time here, May 24th, that's not six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21279.845s">So</a> we're gonna keep to the July 1st deadline, but we're gonna just remove the six months that was originally in the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21290.368s">And</a> I know that was in the resolution and so was the July 1st date, but we're gonna skip the six months and we're just gonna keep the July 1st <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21300.291s">It's</a> just not, I mean, it's just not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21302.912s">It's</a> not fair, it's not equitable, it's not reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21305.634s">And</a> that's how I feel like a strong no for me on May 24th. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21312.777s">That's</a> my strong no. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21314.258s">And</a> I've already provided my timeline and that wasn't second, so that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21320.621s">I'm</a> moving on from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21322.322s">But</a> I really think that <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21327.401s">You</a> know, having this decision on July 1 is rushed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21334.287s">I</a> even suggested in the timeline that I put forth at the beginning of the meeting that <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21341.494s">If</a> we don't count the summer dates, and if the advisory committee were to meet in summer, brings us to September 1st, they would be coming to us with a recommended new name. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21354.843s">Even</a> if they have a couple, like have one meeting in July, one meeting in August, but they still have April, May, June, July, August, and they could come to us with a new name in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21368.069s">The</a> way that I read the resolution, it didn't make sense to me that the name had to, you know, transition over immediately on July 1st, where we didn't even follow all the other dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21380.496s">We</a> didn't, we missed all those other dates and that didn't matter to anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21384.678s">It</a> didn't matter that we missed all those dates.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21387.639s">Yes.</a> <h2><a href="../2021-03-08_ta9ruAXAWFc/2021-03-08_ta9ruAXAWFc.html">Regular School Committee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5601.768s">Okay,</a> sorry, I couldn't get to it, sorry.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6320.984s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6321.865s">I'm</a> also going to summarize my meeting minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6324.706s">So</a> I've condensed them to just about two pages. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6328.048s">I'll</a> be brief, as can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6329.889s">We</a> had a building and grounds meeting on March 3rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6333.411s">One</a> of the topics we discussed was the high school generator. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6336.013s">I</a> shared the specs with everybody via email. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6339.055s">We</a> received the specs from Gone Green. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6341.256s">The</a> total estimate is 186,925. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6345.586s">John</a> McLaughlin informed the committee, it's very important to replace the generator. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6349.508s">There</a> were two generators at Medford High School, one in the front and one in the back of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6353.451s">The</a> one on the vocational side is the one that failed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6357.493s">If</a> we had a power event in the winter, we could have problems with the pipes freezing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6361.856s">We</a> got an update from John McLaughlin after the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6364.497s">He</a> shared an email with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6365.958s">He</a> spoke to the contractor about the life expectancy of the spec that we got for the new generator. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6372.202s">It's</a> going to be 20 years with proper maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6375.544s">Mr.</a> Murphy informed us he met with procurement officials last week regarding the need to go through bidding process for the repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6381.469s">The</a> generator is a capital expense and not an operating cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6384.891s">Mr.</a> Russo and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6385.812s">Van</a> der Kloot expressed, while we have to struggle with priorities, we don't want to be in a situation where the pipes could burst. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6391.376s">We</a> want to avoid the huge emergency costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6394.478s">There</a> was a vote taken on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6396.1s">I</a> motioned to consider the generator as a high priority item at the upcoming Committee of the Whole meeting on March 22nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6404.226s">It</a> was seconded by Paulette Van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6406.308s">All</a> in favor in the motion passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6409.691s">Mayor,</a> I just wanted to know, do we need to take that motion on the floor this evening or will that be okay for the Committee of the Whole meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6420.879s">You</a> can take the vote on the floor, just to confirm. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6425.862s">So</a> I motion to consider the generator as a high priority item at the upcoming committee of the whole meeting on March 22nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6434.226s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6466.732s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6467.633s">After</a> we revisited the discussion about the high school entrance there with three separate projects we talked about ramp at the front of the high school sign in beautification. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6477.081s">We</a> had a well thought discussion about the high school ramp. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6479.904s">Everyone</a> in attendance shared feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6481.866s">The</a> project is a capital project and it will require structural engineer to do the drawings to get an idea of the scope of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6488.832s">to</a> make the ramp ADA compliant is very expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6492.075s">Mr.</a> Cles Andreessen, who is an architect and parent, let us know legally we either leave it as is or do the whole project. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6500.162s">Mr.</a> Murphy stated it would be best if we brought forth a suite of recommendations, including the front entrance, the generator, and more to the committee to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6509.89s">Also,</a> this may need authorization from the city on some improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6514.033s">Next,</a> we discussed a sign for the Merritt High School entrance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6517.336s">Last</a> year, Chris Donovan, parent, shared an idea of a picture idea we had for a sign of the 50th birthday celebration. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6525.583s">I</a> mentioned it would be a great idea if the vocational students could assist with the sign in either one of the shops, metal fabrication or robotic shop, with their laser plasma cutter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6537.014s">Mr.</a> Cushing shared another idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6539.476s">With</a> Groton-Dunstable, they have a mesh banner that would be cost-effective for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6544.96s">It</a> would beautify the building in the short term and allow us to continue with the improvement of the front entrance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6550.303s">Dr.</a> Edouard-Maurice remarked, with so much concrete, there are opportunities to add enhancements. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6556.388s">She</a> pointed out it's difficult to know where the front of the school is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6559.91s">Whatever</a> the wording could be, we could work with the vocational students. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6563.914s">The</a> picture that was shared does show a true front entrance and official main entrance, even if it would be the short time, a new sign landscaping would be the superintendent's recommended priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6576.187s">Dr.</a> Edward Maurice did a check-in with Mr. Fallon while we were in the meeting, and the vocational student shops do have a machine that would make the sign doable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6587.811s">Mr.</a> Fallon will figure out a cost and give us an estimate. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6591.332s">There</a> was another vote taken on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6593.433s">Mr.</a> Van der Kloot motioned to contact Mr. Fallon to get a price on these improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6599.715s">Also,</a> she would like to get the cost estimate of the banner for the front. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6604.476s">exploring</a> the front entranceway banner. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6607.517s">On</a> the side building, it's behind the theater where that concrete section expands. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6614.599s">At</a> this time, I am making that motion on the floor this evening so that we can put those estimates forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6626.121s">Can</a> you please restate the motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6627.842s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6628.563s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6628.943s">Yeah,</a> no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6630.604s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6630.864s">Van</a> der Kloot motioned to contact principal Chad Fallon to get a price estimate on the improvements for the lettering on the front of the front entrance of the school and also to get a cost estimate on the banner for the front of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6646.635s">And</a> we're thinking, you know, the banner, if we could get an estimate on the banner for the cement and a banner for the front entrance, just so that we can do a cost comparison.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6778.035s">Member</a> Kreatz? <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6778.936s">Yes,</a> some point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6780.917s">So</a> I don't know if I read it clearly, but so the first part of the motion was to contact Principal Fallon to ask if he could get an estimate on the lettering that was in the picture that I shared. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6798.728s">It</a> wouldn't be like, we haven't decided on the lettering and what's gonna go on the lettering, <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6804.011s">whether</a> it be Medford High School or Mustang Pride. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6808.254s">That</a> was just an idea that was shared with me because I'm the chairperson of the Building and Ground Subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6815.979s">That</a> particular picture had lettering. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6818.58s">It</a> looked like it was made out of sheet metal and the equipment that the two shops that I had mentioned, which was the robotics and automation and the metal fabrication shops, <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6831.689s">They</a> do have a laser and a plasma cutter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6834.892s">And</a> so those two machines, I believe, it might be possible for the vocational shops and or teachers and students possibly to create that lettering sign which would go on the <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6852.113s">front</a> of the front entrance high school where you go up on the ramp. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6857.137s">And</a> then the idea that Mr. Cushing was sharing with us had to do with the large concrete section that is behind the Caron Theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6868.245s">So</a> all that concrete to brighten up that area <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6874.509s">Mr.</a> Cushing shared an idea of having a banner that might look nice, you know, to cover up the concrete and it might have, you know, we just talked about ideas like having Mustangs running or maybe Mustang Pride could go there with some Mustangs and then the lettering would be on the front of the school with maybe Medford High School so that there's a distinct <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6897.066s">front</a> entrance and um I did I did ask about this um the lettering you know would be I believe would be able to take him down if we were to you know have either the vocational students do it or an outside company and that lettering could be then put on you know <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6916.753s">a</a> renovation in another area, if at some time, maybe five to 10 years from now, there is a full renovation, but the structure of the building itself is sound, so they might keep the original structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6933.086s">I</a> do think that the estimates are for getting prices on those so that at our next meeting, we can talk about the next part of the plan,
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=10599.594s">Okay,</a> did you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=10600.735s">Okay,</a> I'll say it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=10602.216s">Thank</a> you to all the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=10603.657s">All</a> the poems were beautifully written and inspirational. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=10606.66s">You're</a> all talented poets. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=10608.361s">Incredible</a> job to everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=10610.002s">Thank</a> you all.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13245.464s">Sorry,</a> my dog was barking, yes.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15552.728s">Yes,</a> I was just trying to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15554.789s">Yes,</a> so, you know, I would like to ask my colleagues, you know, if they would consider, respectfully consider, you know, in advance of the meeting, reviewing the timeline that has been put forth in both resolutions and consider expanding the dates <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15576.135s">I</a> mean, I just went back and I read the original resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15580.241s">So</a> the, the, the original resolution states, be it resolved that the Christopher Columbus elementary school be renamed effective July one 2021 in advisory committee shall be created. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15594.179s">with</a> a term of six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15596.32s">So</a> the advisory committee was supposed to have six months beginning no later than October 1st and provide a recommendation to the committee no later than February 1st, 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15609.748s">So</a> in that original resolution, it was given ample time to come up with a new name, have that committee formed, <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15621.354s">have</a> a new name discussed, thoroughly vetted, and that the school committee would reconvene the Committee of the Whole before September 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15630.811s">Now,</a> I'm just pointing out the dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15634.049s">all</a> of those dates have already been passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15637.43s">We</a> missed all those deadline dates and we missed all those deadline dates because we're in a pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15644.012s">And</a> as we've seen in the pandemic, all the dates had to slide for everything we were doing, everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15651.653s">It's</a> just all the dates had to slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15654.734s">So,</a> I am just respectfully asking if my colleagues could think, <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15662.196s">In</a> preparation of Wednesday's meeting, you know if we can maybe try to come up with a different timeline, so that there can be a thoughtful respective. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15673.489s">I'm</a> sorry not respective reflective discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15677.113s">for</a> that advisory committee once they're formed to thoroughly research a new name, have public meetings, listening sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15689.943s">You</a> know, I feel like we're rushing this to make that deadline. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15695.223s">and</a> we're still in a pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15698.646s">So</a> I just feel that it's such an enormous, you know, task and it just, it requires time, thoughtful time consideration in hearing from all community members.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15921.631s">Yes,</a> I just had one more, because I've been hearing, you know, over the last couple of days, and I did not read it in the original resolution, but I've been hearing that if <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15935.569s">The</a> deadline wasn't met by July 1 2021 that the Columbus school would would then be renamed the no name school, but I'm not seeing that in the original resolution so I'm just, you know, I'm just wondering, you know, is that something that I'm. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15956.417s">missing</a> or overlooking if um one of the committee members who wrote that resolution if you could let us know because I have been hearing a lot about that and I just want to you know kind of get an answer on that because I don't know and I didn't know anything about that.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15985.925s">Okay,</a> so that just might have been something that got kind of overheard somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15989.766s">Somewhere,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15990.986s">Okay,</a> all right, I just wanted to confirm that.<h2><a href="../2021-03-03_zMDmsK0LIsU/2021-03-03_zMDmsK0LIsU.html">Building & Grounds Subcommittee Meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=331.686s">OK,</a> so the cost is, and I'm just going to shrink this down one second. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=335.369s">I'm</a> just going to shrink it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=337.311s">All</a> right, so the cost, and just move this over. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=339.432s">Oh,</a> OK, it's moved on the wrong side. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=342.715s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=346.218s">The</a> cost is, oh, OK, one moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=350.722s">I</a> think I have it, and I saved it here. $128,675. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=358.562s">So</a> the question I have, John, is, you know, I just have some general questions and I can be able to just answer them. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=367.344s">So</a> what I didn't know is, you know, I looked at the draft of the capital improvement plan and I noticed that the generator wasn't on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=378.027s">So</a> I wanted to know, you know, what you have for information, you know, maybe could you explain a little bit about, you know, how important <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=387.432s">replacing</a> the generator is and what does the generator do?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=502.063s">Okay,</a> excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=505.924s">That's,</a> that's excellent, because that's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=508.665s">And</a> so what <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=511.758s">You</a> know, okay, the other question I had was does that cost the 128 675 does that include the labor to install and remove the old generator or are we going to incur additional costs.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=552.56s">And</a> would it be a problem to keep the old generator, you know, in the building, you know, is there any, you know, issues that might occur if, if it was left there.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=608.488s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=609.289s">And,</a> um, and then, oh, my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=612.05s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=612.39s">Um,</a> go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=613.15s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=613.37s">I'll</a> let, uh, Mr. Russo.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1968.177s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1968.737s">I</a> do have that question you got to see it too yes so that is a question that I did have you know and I that's one of my questions I had if we were to convert that ramp to an ADA compliant ramp would vehicles be able to drive on it I know that the um the ban uses that ramp and I think that ramp might be used for <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1989.002s">maybe</a> things being delivered to the school in the front entrance that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1993.287s">I'm</a> not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1996.23s">And</a> that would be a question maybe for Mr. McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1999.074s">Do</a> you know the interest of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2000.095s">Like</a> if we were to convert a utility ramp into an ADA ramp, would it be vehicle?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2050.782s">Yes,</a> you may. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2051.263s">Go</a> ahead, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2051.663s">Van</a> der Kloot.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2111.202s">Mr.</a> McLaughlin, I think you froze. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2114.084s">You</a> froze for a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2115.625s">We</a> didn't hear what you said, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2116.965s">And</a> then Mr. Andreessen would like to maybe try to answer that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2120.127s">Go</a> ahead, Mr. Andreessen.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2127.992s">Yes,</a> we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2128.873s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2171.049s">That's</a> excellent, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2174.133s">Any</a> other questions on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2181.183s">So</a> the other question I had was, I know at our last meeting <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2188.795s">You</a> know, we wanted to know if you'd be able to approach a site contractor or Mason. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2194.438s">And</a> I know that it was just very busy times. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2197.18s">We're</a> trying to get the schools open up to get the kids back in for the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2200.742s">So,</a> you know, that we didn't get to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2203.503s">So,</a> you know, as part of this process, we do need an estimate to go to the next step. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2212.888s">which</a> is to, you know, you know, cause as part of the capital improvement meeting that we have coming up on the 22nd, we'll need some sort of an estimate to bring forth to the other committee members so that they have the, you know, all the figures that, you know, we have to add up to, you know, that free cash amount of the $816,000, you know, or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2236.335s">So</a> I'm wondering, John, would it be possible, because I was thinking of making a motion to get an estimate for the front entrance to make that ramp ADA compliant to get that estimate on or before that capital improvement plan meeting on the 22nd?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2370.139s">Okay,</a> Mr. Andreessen, please.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2411.218s">Kathy?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2412.299s">Yes,</a> okay, Mr. Russo, go ahead.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2766.352s">I</a> don't mind at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2767.293s">I</a> have four dogs.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3155.945s">No,</a> so that photo that was the next as part of the front entrance. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3160.587s">That</a> was what I was going to talk about next was last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3165.59s">During</a> the beautification. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3167.651s">Mr.</a> Chris Christopher Donovan he's a parent community member and photographer. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3172.493s">He</a> had shared that picture with us the day after the beautification day. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3179.657s">He's</a> a photographer, so he did the Photoshop and he did the front entrance picture idea that he had for the front entrance that he shared with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3193.343s">When</a> we had originally seen it, it was discussed a while back before COVID shutdown that that would be a really nice idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3201.627s">for</a> the 50th birthday celebration for the high school to get a new sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3206.71s">And</a> actually, I had an idea, and I even talked to my son, because he was in robotics and automation engineering. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3217.037s">And</a> I showed it to him, and he said that it's very possible that it's something that could be done easily with a laser cutter or plasma cutter, possibly. <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3228.264s">Has</a> everybody seen the photo? <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3230.905s">What</a> I can do is I can screen share it right now.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8472.054s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8475.837s">And</a> I didn't see the presentation in the shared folder. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8478.899s">Would</a> you be able to email it to me separately?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=8489.408s">Thanks,</a> and then I guess as soon as you know the dates of those meetings, if you could send out a tentative date schedule, because that would be a lot of meetings that we have to include in our current calendars.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9190.635s">Yes,</a> I just had one follow up question. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9192.417s">So,</a> um, you know, I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9194.219s">I</a> heard from Miss Graham and, um, you know, I've been thinking about it and, you know, I do have some concerns myself about only having a pre budget meetings and subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9204.171s">Um,</a> you know, I think that, you know, my fellow committee members who are not in the subcommittee won't <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9212.053s">be</a> updated on the pre-budget materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9214.956s">So</a> I would just like to know a little bit more information about how that's going to work so that the other committee members who are not in the subcommittee are going to be voicing their questions and concerns with those pre-budget reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9233.054s">Because</a> what I can kind of, I'm just seeing in my head is that, we're gonna have the subcommittee meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9239.938s">We're</a> gonna be talking about all those pre-budget reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9243.24s">And</a> then we're gonna be approving those to go to the regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9247.002s">And</a> then that's when the other committee members are gonna get those reports to then ask questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9255.506s">So</a> I just, I think that's why in the past, we've always done it as a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9260.749s">so</a> that everybody's included in the meeting at the same time while that administrator in principle is there doing that presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9269.236s">I</a> don't know if there's been any discussion about that, Mr. Murphy.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10881.056s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10881.776s">I</a> just want to make sure because I know when this was on the agenda in last June, there wasn't a lot of notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10890.958s">And</a> I know that you're putting on the agenda to notify the public that there is a Committee of the Whole on March 10th. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10897.0s">And</a> I just wanted to know if <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10899.18s">Somebody</a> would be able to invite a representative from the NAACP, the Italian American community, some South Medford residents, the diversity director of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10913.443s">of</a> course, you know, the elementary school parents, caregivers, teachers, students, leaders, PTO, you know, just so that, you know, that was one of the major concerns was when we had the June meeting, people didn't know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10929.433s">And</a> I know it's on our agenda tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10933.155s">But</a> I, you know, like to know if it's going to be, you know, shared, you know, on social media to give people the opportunity to join in, or in be included with the discussions that are going to be taking place around the. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10949.815s">then</a> the renaming of the school um because we did receive a lot of emails and I was confused myself because you know we were getting messages and a lot of the community thought we were taking another vote this evening and you know and you know we're we're not doing that and I don't I don't think and I'm I'm not sure but we're not going to be doing that at the committee of the whole meeting so you know <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10977.248s">I</a> guess the committee the whole meeting, I think, is going to be to. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10985.235s">schedule</a> like the planning committee, almost like what we did with the other committees, like forming a task force that's gonna be a very diverse group of community members, you know, from all different areas of Medford that are gonna be part of this committee with an application process and how many members will be on the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11007.81s">Is</a> that what is being discussed in the March 10th Committee of the Whole meeting?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=13546.868s">Yes,</a> so I had a question, I did read through the report and so from what we've all read is that DESE doesn't currently have plans to offer the remote testing option. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=13557.295s">So</a> all the schools must plan to offer the testing in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=13560.998s">So</a> I had a question, will there be enough space in each classroom at each school to accommodate all the students in the cohorts taking the MCAS test while maintaining the six foot distancing?

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=11803.152s">Um,</a> yeah, so I'm opposed to prohibiting perfect attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=11808.633s">You</a> know, so if that is the, the resolution to send it to the rules and policy subcommittee so that it can be worked out to remove perfect attendance from the policies in attendance, then, you know, I won't be able to support the resolution as it is written.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=13093.656s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=13093.956s">So</a> I just wanted to know and just to clarify. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=13096.317s">So</a> this resolution is to send it to the rules and equity policy subcommittee to work out the details about the reports, because I'm just thinking that is this going to take. <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=13109.703s">a</a> lot of, you know, extra work on the administrative side, getting those reports ready, or are those reports going to be easily, you know, kind of, you know, extracted via a data, you know, extract, or I'm just not sure how this, because it seems like every field trip to get all that data in all those reports, you know.<h2><a href="../2021-01-11_NISeEVILrmI/2021-01-11_NISeEVILrmI.html">Organizational Meeting & Regular Meeting of the Medford School Committee</a></h2>

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11908.99s">Yes,</a> I just want to thank the team for all your hard work and efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11914.012s">It's</a> a very comprehensive report, just like everybody said. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11916.893s">And</a> I don't want to repeat some of the things that were said. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11919.935s">And</a> my colleagues had very good questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11922.276s">And</a> I just, when reading through it, I was thinking the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11926.117s">A</a> summary, I came up with the checklist, but a summary is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11930.899s">So</a> I was thinking the same thing, because it was such a very big report. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11935.601s">When</a> I was reading through it, I just have it here myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11939.163s">One</a> second. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11939.663s">Oh,</a> here we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11940.843s">So</a> I just wanted to, you know, just to clarify, and I think this is what it means, because we hear a lot about cyberbullying, and, you know, that's really common with the internet and the different social media tools that we have out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11955.589s">So</a> does on page 19, the definition of <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11962.272s">you</a> know, regarding technological cyberbullying. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11966.253s">So</a> it does mention something that it would, something that does bullying that occurs on or off school, cyberbullying from a home computer or mobile device, if that bullying occurs in a hostile environment for the subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11979.558s">So</a> does that incorporate, you know, if somebody was, you know, getting bullied on social media sites, things like that? <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11988.061s">That's</a> that's what I assume that but I just wanted to clarify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11990.883s">Yes,</a> that's what exactly what it means. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11992.644s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11993.464s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11995.145s">And</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11996.426s">And</a> I would be, I would be okay, I would be comfortable approving it tonight with the recommended changes that were mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12005.53s">I</a> just wanted to mention that to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12008.092s">Van</a> der Kloot.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12623.942s">I</a> just had a thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12625.363s">I</a> was just thinking about how we've had a late start, like a two-hour late start, where I know the storm didn't have measurable amount of snow on Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12638.408s">It</a> was still dangerous driving. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12640.949s">There</a> was whiteout conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12643.81s">So</a> I was thinking, because I know that if we have a late start, <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12649.232s">And</a> we're still getting the parking lots ready to open up. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12654.436s">Would</a> something like that still be possible? <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12656.537s">Even</a> if, let's say, families are home and their students are remote, they still might need to get their cars cleared off in case of an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12667.204s">just</a> to get out of their house on a particular day. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12671.027s">I</a> was thinking it could still affect people who are remote and who are hybrid. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12675.951s">I</a> was just thinking about it overall because you just never know when you're going to have to rush out the door for something. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12683.716s">I</a> was just thinking about that as a late start. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12685.958s">Does</a> that affect the end of the year number of school days?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12803.87s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12804.391s">And</a> I know how closely you monitor the forecast and work with the different administrators. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12809.535s">So</a> I really appreciate everything you've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12811.556s">I</a> was the vice chair last year and I got some calls from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12816.099s">So</a> I was actively involved with everything that you do to make that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12822.144s">So</a> I appreciate what you do making that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12825.946s">It's</a> a tough decision and you always make the right choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12828.568s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13020.565s">Yes,</a> yep, so over the weekend, I reviewed the MASC guide. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13025.126s">It</a> was sent to us, Mr. Russo, I don't know if you remember, but you sent it to us a while back, a few months back. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13030.067s">And</a> so, yes, so the very first step is having the superintendent do her self-assessment, submit that to the committee, and then it takes place, I guess the evaluation will take place over several meetings that I think would be committee of the whole meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13047.911s">And</a> that would, you know, I think it's just, <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13050.832s">you</a> know, not achievable at this time to have everything done by December 31st with only a couple weeks left with all the upcoming scheduled meetings already. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13062.555s">So</a> I, I agree with, you know, giving more time to, you know, to have the superintendent, you know, give us the assessment and then we'll have to meet once we get the assessment to, <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13077.199s">clarify</a> and ask questions, and then we'll have to do an assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13082.762s">And</a> I believe it also says that as a committee, we have to determine how we're going to go about doing the evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13091.085s">Are</a> we going to do individual self-evaluations? <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13094.126s">Are</a> we going to do one big committee evaluation? <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13097.828s">So</a> there's still a lot of different factors that we have to talk about even before we do the evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13106.972s">But</a> that's just what I wanted to mention.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13180.155s">Yeah,</a> no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13181.436s">I</a> can do that.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13203.19s">In</a> the past years, we've done it as a committee of the whole because <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13208.4s">You</a> know, every committee member wants to be involved in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13212.042s">I</a> think what we found out with the pre-budget meetings was we wanted to have those pre-budget meetings go to the personnel subcommittee meetings, but the entire committee wanted to be a part of that process because it's one of the major responsibilities that we have, which is the same thing with the superintendent evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13233.296s">outlined</a> in the guidelines from MASC, you know, we have to decide how we're going to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13238.938s">Are</a> we going to do it as a committee of the whole? <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13241.218s">Are</a> we going to send it to the personnel subcommittee? <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13244.239s">Would</a> the other committee members be okay with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13247.44s">You</a> know, if they sent in their, you know, their individual about like there's it's a it's a detailed guide, which I just reviewed over the weekend, which I'm going to send you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13256.822s">So</a> right after I <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13258.883s">this</a> um but so it is it's it's actually a big process you know so when i saw the resolution i said i when mr russo sent it earlier this year i looked at it over the summer and i started to go through it and it kept on saying the first step is that you must get the superintendent evaluation so i knew we couldn't do anything at that point until we have that so um yeah so i just revisited it again and um i will share that the document with you
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13610.133s">Yes,</a> I just I just sent the link and I just wanted to there is a section. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13614.438s">It's</a> on goals, and it says the evaluation model is goal focus is intended to foster growth on the part of the individual educator for the superintendent, and then it goes on to say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13627.192s">in</a> regulations for the evaluation superintendents are required to have one professional practice goal related to their individual professional growth and one student learning goal related to their impact on student achievement so I don't think it's it's <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13646.452s">Another</a> typical I mean it's what's detailed here is just something different. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13653.379s">I</a> know it was it was updated in December, 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13657.884s">So</a> I think that this is like the new guidelines for the <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13663.249s">for</a> the superintendent evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13664.809s">Yeah,</a> we haven't done them yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13668.57s">We</a> haven't done the new evaluation process with the new goals yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13673.511s">This</a> will be the first time we're doing them, but it's just saying that there should be two goals, the student learning goal and the professional practice goal.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14266.902s">Yes,</a> I agree with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14269.924s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14271.165s">I</a> think, you know, I've been on the committee and over the past several years, the schedule does come out typically in February and the meetings begin sometimes I think as early as April. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14286.517s">And</a> I know that <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14291.016s">You</a> know, we are putting a lot on the administration, the superintendent with everything going on with the COVID and the opening of the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14299.142s">You</a> know, I want to vote for a schedule, but I just think that we need some more time for the administration to get us the schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14307.288s">and</a> if we could just, you know, maybe a friendly amendment to, you know, as Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14312.59s">Van</a> De Koop mentioned, to the end of January, if, you know, they could get the schedule to us by then, and then we can have it all in our calendars. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14319.913s">We'll</a> have the committee of the wholes, we'll have the superintendent's evaluation, we'll have the pre-budget meetings, and we'll have a complete calendar by the end of January. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14330.898s">I</a> just think that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14333.239s">We</a> have the holidays coming up in December and some of these administrators and teachers and staff, you know, they haven't had some time off. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14342.643s">So,</a> you know, and we're still putting some things on them during the holidays, you know, by having them, you know, with the reopening of the schools, getting the students ready to get back into school. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14353.908s">the</a> beginning of January for some of the high school students that still have to get back and just everything else that's going to go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14361.71s">As</a> we enter, we just still have two more weeks left of actual school time and then it is holiday break and a lot of us just take some time off in the holidays. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14374.714s">I'd</a> like to vote for it, but with an amendment for some more time. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14381.516s">That's</a> all I wanted to say.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14551.027s">Yes,</a> I was going to say the same thing as McLaughlin said is that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14556.756s">I</a> don't think it's achievable right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14560.239s">I</a> do think it will be achievable and I thought I recall that this would be an ad hoc request like report where it's supposed to be sent to the superintendent not in the form of a resolution but as an ad hoc request report so that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14579.093s">She</a> could then look at it and determine if it's feasible to be done and possibly how long it would take. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14585.642s">That's</a> how I read the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14587.664s">I</a> do think that at some point we're going to need that information as we go into the budget, but I don't think <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14596.395s">you</a> know, immediately we need that information, you know, in January, you know, we're going to, you know, have the date set for the pre-budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14606.761s">We're</a> going to need some information about what's, you know, left over for the grants, but, you know, having that information right away in the middle of the global pandemic, <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14618.235s">directly</a> after the holidays with the superintendent evaluation in the pre-budget schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14625.101s">I</a> mean, I just think that I'm getting overwhelmed just thinking about it and I'm not the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14631.306s">That's</a> all I wanted to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14633.188s">It's</a> just we're putting a lot on one person.<h2><a href="../2020-11-25_akf9szSeoOw/2020-11-25_akf9szSeoOw.html">Special School Committee Meeting to Discuss COVID 19 Metrics</a></h2>

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7992.493s">Yes,</a> so the original motion was a motion to accept the superintendent's recommendations continue to utilize parts one building classroom readiness and three district in school specific metrics from the original member public schools COVID-19 reopening dashboard update. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8010.758s">reopening</a> dashboard, update part two, Medford community health metrics of the original Medford public schools COVID-19 reopening dashboard to include department public health updated color coded classification system. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8025.307s">And</a> it was amended as noted per Melanie McLaughlin to include the disaggregated data of the students who were actually in-person or remote regardless of assigned cohort. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8036.594s">and</a> to include the amendment from Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8039.076s">Graham,</a> adding an asterisk to note the name of the building affected in the color-coded chart, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8050.106s">Is</a> that right, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8050.847s">Graham,</a> in the color-coded chart?<h2><a href="../2020-11-17_s-4VJY_TglE/2020-11-17_s-4VJY_TglE.html">Regular School Committee Meeting November 16, 2020</a></h2>
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=453.64s">I</a> just have one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=455.241s">I</a> just want to ask Dr. Maurice if that was okay and doable with the administration on moving it up that many months. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=465.268s">Is</a> that something that they would be able to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=467.969s">It's</a> not for this year, it's just going to be for next year?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=724.005s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=724.745s">So</a> the building and grants subcommittee had a meeting via zoom on November 5th. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=730.447s">Subcommittee</a> members, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=731.608s">Van</a> der Kloot and Mr. Russo were present. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=733.828s">Also</a> in attendance were Mr. Cles Anderson, parent architect community board development member, Fiona Maxwell, procurement city of Medford, Alicia Hunt, parent and director of energy and environment, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=747.313s">and</a> Carolyn Montello Parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=749.357s">Also</a> present were Chad Fallon, Paul DeLeva, John McLaughlin, Peter Cushing, and Dr. Edouard Maurice. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=757.401s">First</a> we discuss the upcoming 2021 subcommittee dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=759.624s">So</a> our March 3rd, 2021, 5 to 6.30 and June 2nd, 2021 is not good because of graduation. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=763.188s">So</a> the new date is May 26th, 2021 at 5 to 6.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=777.725s">After</a> we discussed the career technical updates from Mr. Fallon, he mentioned that the only positive with the students not being in schools has been the ability to do updates at the Method Vocational Technical High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=790.178s">Some</a> of the completed projects are the robotics and engineering, classroom lab and engineering shop, paint and labor were provided by painters union DC35. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=799.384s">LED</a> lighting was installed in many areas, thanks to Alicia Hunt for her help with that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=805.668s">Programming</a> and web development moved into a new space with 25 workstations, new carpet squares, paint and new computers. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=813.333s">Construction</a> technology lab, desks were built by the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=817.53s">The</a> current projects are cosmetology. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=820.151s">A</a> private donor gave $100,000 to put toward this program, provided for painting, electrical sinks, marble install of workstations, replacement windows, chemical mixing room, eyewash stations, and more. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=835.779s">And</a> they're on track to finishing in the next couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=838.821s">And</a> it's going to have a really nice name. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=840.302s">It's</a> going to be named the Priscilla Hoff Salon. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=843.243s">The</a> automotive and technology resurface the paint shop floor at no cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=848.43s">It</a> was done by apprentices from painters union, the students assisted with the, with the design plans, and they designed a racing flag, like a racing flag design on the wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=859.606s">The</a> painting was an epoxy process. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=861.788s">Sherman</a> Williams and Union shared the cost of the paint. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=865.471s">Originally,</a> Mr. Fallon got a quote of $65,000 and $99,000, but it was provided free of charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=871.797s">This</a> was a once-in-a-lifetime project. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=874.486s">I</a> just want to extend my thanks, and we did at the meeting to Mr. Fallon, the students, vocational teachers, apprentices from the Painters Union, Sherman Williams, and the Hoff family for all the work that's being done to continue to improve the Medford Vocational Technical High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=889.6s">Also,</a> special thanks to Alicia Hunt for the support of her schools in finding ways to get energy efficient resources to all of our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=896.547s">We</a> have so many great partnerships. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=898.869s">I</a> provided with the group with an update about the brick fundraiser. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=902.013s">It's</a> currently on hold. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=904.056s">And</a> we'll, you know, update the, you know, the committee with any updates that we have in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=908.762s">Then</a> we moved on to the discussion about the member high school front entrance. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=914.85s">and</a> Mr. Cless Anderson, parent of high school and middle school students. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=918.852s">He's</a> an architect and community development board member, shared a design of Meveritt High School front entrance. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=925.135s">Mr.</a> Andreessen met at the site earlier this summer with my fellow subcommittee members and a couple of other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=931.878s">After</a> the BRIC fundraiser idea, he planned a design of what the front entrance would maybe visualize what it could look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=940.862s">He</a> volunteered to put together an architectural design. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=943.723s">He</a> went to the high school front entrance with five high school students who helped measure the design in the entrance and they counted the bricks. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=951.684s">The</a> current ramp doesn't seem compliant to the code. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=954.665s">Kless</a> offered a plan to integrate a design into the brick work. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=958.566s">The</a> first idea was a map of Medford in blue bricks with personal messages that can be stamped on the bricks. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=964.267s">You</a> could have special bricks with landmarks in the town. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=966.987s">The</a> second idea was to put the Medford logo into the bricks. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=970.288s">We</a> would need to think about whether it was recognizable by the eye. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=974.032s">I'm</a> sorry, eye level or like, you know, from a distance. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=978.096s">The</a> students offered an idea of a wave or scientific image. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=982.1s">It</a> showed a hue wave. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=983.982s">Another</a> idea of a simple repetitive pattern, smaller quantity specialized bricks. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=988.446s">There</a> were a lot of options on how we can deploy this. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=992.49s">Mr.</a> Russo and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=993.471s">Van</a> der Kloot expressed safety concerns with the current ramp. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=996.513s">Also</a> discussed there were concerns about the sustainability in the white bricks. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1000.455s">Will</a> they get dirty? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1001.756s">Kless</a> suggests using all new bricks. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1004.757s">So</a> we asked John, you know, if he could get back to us with the cost of what it would cost to replace all the bricks just to get an estimate on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1014.46s">And</a> then John also asked Mr. Klaus Anderson if he could do an RFP. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1019.983s">And</a> we'll consider, you know, the fundraiser after the project or maybe when we get the estimates and then maybe can meet again and talk about the project again. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1029.557s">Also</a> on the call was Fiona Maxwell from the Procurement Department in Medford City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1034.281s">She</a> was there to help answer questions and provide us with some information. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1038.124s">She</a> mentioned there were a lot of rules we need to follow. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1040.866s">It</a> sounds like we have a few different projects going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1043.528s">Project</a> A is a capital project with new ramp, walls, and bricks. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1047.832s">Project</a> B, whether the bricks can be taken out and also an ADA issue, an ADA ramp that needs to be redone. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1055.918s">The</a> design work is exempt from limits. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1058.48s">If</a> it's over a certain $1 amount, it would need to be sealed for a bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1062.042s">For</a> example, ramp and signage are compliant of 39M. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1066.843s">Purchasing</a> bricks and reselling them make a deliverable good. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1070.105s">Architect</a> services make for a bigger project. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1072.886s">There</a> were a lot of components under one umbrella that we were all talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1077.328s">And</a> I really appreciated Fiona being on the call to <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1080.289s">know,</a> to guide us and help answer some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1082.991s">And</a> she's going to reach out to john, you know, over the next couple of weeks, regarding some of the things we asked for, you know, for him to look into. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1091.218s">Miss</a> Carolyn Montello, who's a parent, also volunteered at the site originally this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1096.142s">And</a> she's shown a great interest into helping us with this brick project in the design of the front entrance. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1101.726s">She</a> noted the original intent was to sell the bricks for scholarships, not to cover the whole cost of the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1106.889s">So</a> she reminded us of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1108.951s">And</a> also like what we all talked about was that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1112.373s">I</a> think people will get more excited when we maybe have some sort of a renovated design that we can show people and then maybe do the fundraising of the bricks once we have that design and it will be renovating the school and scholarship program. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1127.38s">So</a> what we all came to the conclusion is that the project has evolved into kind of a capital project now, a little bit more or a mix of a capital project and then the fundraiser. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1141.066s">So,</a> and Dr. Maurice also, she expressed that this may need to be done in phases staggered over time with the goal of getting the change of a front entrance. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1150.934s">And</a> that's what our goal will be is getting the change of the front entrance. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1153.996s">And</a> the first step is getting a cost estimate to determine how to move forward from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1159.541s">So</a> we did ask John to get some numbers on the different phases, especially those not ADA compliant or safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1167.627s">and</a> I just want to thank John McLaughlin, Klaus Andresen, Caroline Montello. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1174.636s">I'm</a> sorry, I put Bill McLaughlin in the minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1176.899s">It</a> should be Bill Carr, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1179.863s">Susie,</a> would you be able to update that? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1181.685s">I'm</a> sorry, I just noticed it right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1183.828s">I</a> was getting names mixed up, should say Bill Carr. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1186.811s">And</a> the students for their volunteering and assisting with design. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1191.294s">I</a> mean, I thought that was so wonderful that the students went out and they enjoyed what Mr. Andres has said was they enjoyed coming up with designs and counting the bricks. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1201.503s">And</a> it was just a wonderful to hear that report. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1204.766s">And</a> we are very fortunate to have everybody helping us with these future plans and maybe future architects. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1211.505s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1212.526s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1213.006s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1213.846s">Yeah,</a> no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1214.627s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1215.067s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1215.487s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1216.108s">Did</a> you have more. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1217.288s">Did</a> you just had a couple more. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1219.33s">There</a> was. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1220.75s">It</a> was a really involved meeting, and I couldn't really cut out a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1226.634s">So</a> I'll just run through. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1227.574s">I</a> just have them bulleted right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1229.956s">So</a> john McLaughlin provided updates with see building project. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1234.718s">He's</a> waiting for the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1236.259s">He's</a> waiting for tiles, samples. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1239.181s">He's</a> looking at colors to look the same as the science lab bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1244.265s">The</a> treads on the stairs are done. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1246.226s">I</a> don't know if you remember that we went on that walkthrough and the treads are done. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1250.169s">The</a> emergency generator is going to cost over $200,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1252.71s">There's</a> only $160,000 left in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1257.914s">Between</a> the bathroom project and the generator, we are going to be running into money problems with both of those projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1264.559s">The</a> Andrews school roof finished this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1267.181s">The</a> solar project will finish next summer. <a

href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1273.927s">Playground</a> resurfacing, money from the grant CPA, the Columbus and the Brooks are resurfaced. <a

that we have procurement done for the soft surface of the playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1309.328s">The</a> McGlynn was more prone to flooding, and also they're looking for something for students of all abilities and paths in life to give a better access to the playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1319.601s">And</a> Alicia Height informed us that she is

Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1338.593s">Hunt</a> replied that the upfront costs are higher for the canopy and the battery grant is a funded grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1344.757s">and</a> then the meeting adjourned and you know it was a really really great meeting and I really appreciate everybody and all the attendance and thank

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1629.589s">Is</a> Mr. Cushing on the call, Dr. Cushing? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1631.71s">Because</a> he might, he is. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1634.351s">Yeah,</a> he has his hand raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1635.952s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1638.009s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1639.009s">Yes,</a> do you know the answer to that?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2303.485s">we</a> would have to go to city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2306.246s">We'd</a> have to maybe have John McLaughlin would meet with Mr. Murphy and, you know, discuss what the next steps would be if they're going over because they, you know, John's concerns were that it's going to be a problem to do the generator and the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2323.594s">There</a> isn't going to be enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2326.456s">So,</a> I mean, I would think that we would have to go to city council to ask for additional money.<h2><a href="../2020-11-10_3tlRdpeIbkM/2020-11-10_3tlRdpeIbkM.html">Communications, Strategy & Stakeholder Engagement Subcommittee Meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4326.972s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4327.773s">Thank</a> you very much for the report, Dr. Edouard-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4330.636s">I</a> also want to just thank Dr. Peter Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4334.18s">I</a> know I reached out to him a couple weeks ago, because while I'm working remotely from home, I was on the phone with a teacher in another district, and we were just talking about, oh, you know, how are you reaching your families? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4347.413s">She</a> had mentioned that in her town, that that's exactly what they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4351.856s">They</a> had to, um, enter, you know, with the partnership of their police department, do wellness checks at their houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4359.12s">And,</a> uh, they were able to reach the families and identify and get the information out to everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4364.323s">So</a> I think it's just great. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4366.004s">And</a> I want to thank the administration and the Medford police department for their partnership and his and their team. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4372.228s">It's</a> just, that's going to be terrific. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4373.669s">And</a> I can't wait to hear back on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4375.79s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4376.547s">I</a> did want to ask about, so as part of the number of students not engaged in the Zoom meetings, I know I had brought this up in another meeting that I've heard from some parents that don't want their child, for whatever reason, to participate in the Zoom meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4393.48s">So,</a> you know, I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4395.802s">I</a> think that, you know, some parents just don't want their children to be on the zoom meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4400.865s">So</a> I just want to make sure that, you know, you know, once again like that, the students, it's not going to be held against them in terms of their grade is pass or fail. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4411.052s">I</a> just want to reconfirm that information, because it sounds like <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4416.135s">That</a> information is being factored into whether or not the students are engaged or needing to be closely monitored. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4423.48s">So</a> if you could maybe explain that a little bit.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4732.785s">I</a> just had a follow-up. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4734.246s">So</a> I just wanted to just get some clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4738.148s">I</a> know when we first talked about the distant learning plan, it was mentioned and I recall Bernadette Riccidilli mentioning that Zoom wasn't required. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4749.012s">So</a> I just wanted to know, are we now requiring the Zoom communication or <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4755.935s">If</a> the family or student are doing the other work, but they're just not wanting to participate in the Zoom classroom meeting on the phone, and they're doing everything else, would that pass fail be held against them?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4919.448s">Thank</a> you, Kathy you all set or I just had a final, I just wanted to I did ask earlier, when Mr. deliver was speaking about his committee the whole report. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4929.474s">Are</a> there any families that are still waiting for a device, and will there be a third deployment I know right now, the schools are closed, but I was just, you know, didn't know if that was maybe if schools going to be out, possibly longer, and we have families that are waiting for a device, will there be another deployment.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=6600.174s">Good.</a> 
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10028.819s">Oh,</a> no, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10029.84s">Member</a> Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10032.482s">Oh,</a> my, oh, off mute, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10034.964s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Texeria, for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10037.746s">I</a> just had a question, because I know in your report, it mentioned that you haven't been able to get in touch with 30 of the 480 English learners, and you continue to do the outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10049.976s">And</a> I think, did you do a mailing as well, Mr. Texeria? <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10054.06s">Like</a> an actual mailing to the families, their address?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10782.448s">There</a> you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10785.15s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10786.191s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10786.491s">So</a> I just wanted to, you know, I was speaking with Melanie and I really appreciate all the email communications and updates from the superintendent and the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10798.238s">It's</a> been phenomenal, the updates and the emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10802.18s">I</a> do and did feel a little bit like, <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10805.422s">in</a> the dark a little bit because we weren't actually meeting the same way that you were meeting with the administrators, let's say, and having like those Zoom calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10813.446s">So,</a> you know, I do support having, you know, a meeting before the, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10822.471s">before</a> we're supposed to go back to school, which is, you know, set to be May 4th, because with the coronavirus, you know, it's constantly changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10830.517s">Even</a> the president, he originally planned to want to have people to go back after Easter, but he made a decision after speaking with researchers that, you know, it wasn't in the best interest and for the safety of the Americans, citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10844.926s">And</a> I feel like the <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10847.408s">the</a> virus is changing every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10849.43s">We</a> just don't know what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10851.231s">And</a> that would be a long stretch if we didn't have a meeting before, at least like, I mean, even if it was a special meeting, it doesn't have to be scheduled for three hours, but just a special meeting to catch up and, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10867.145s">you</a> know, talk about where we are and where's the coronavirus, how is it infecting Medford, things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10875.07s">So</a> that's my thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10876.451s">I</a> do support having it the 20th if everybody else agrees with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10880.914s">But</a> I think that, you know, we have to continuously monitor what's happening with this virus. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10888.279s">And</a> because it spreads very, very rapidly, it's very contagious. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=10893.963s">And</a> we just don't know.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=11156.029s">I</a> could go earlier if people could. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=11158.571s">Like,</a> I am working remotely from home, but I'm home, so I get out at three. <a href="https://youtu.be/h6VaG8W1tBc&t=11164.134s">I</a> could be in a meeting as early as like 3.30 just to, you know, get something to eat and, you know, be ready if that works for everybody else.<h2><a href="../2020-03-11_T943Bcjm1yk/2020-03-11_T943Bcjm1yk.html">Medford School Committee meeting March 9, 2020</a></h2>

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5735.741s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5738.663s">Member</a> Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5740.164s">Oh,</a> yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5740.964s">Thank</a> you very much for the reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5742.845s">And</a> I just want to say, I did notice that you're going to the Intrepid Sea, Air, Space Museum. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5747.671s">I</a> googled it and it looks really exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5750.854s">There's</a> so much for the students, so much information to be gained. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5754.739s">It</a> sounds like a great stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5756.9s">It</a> has a really high rating, and it looks really fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5760.561s">So</a> I wanted to know if there was any difference between where we did have the middle school lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5768.003s">Was</a> there a difference in the numbers from last year to this year with the McGlynn and the Andrews? <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5772.424s">Or</a> did the numbers kind of stay the same with the number of students going? <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5776.179s">Was</a> there any noticeable difference?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5800.478s">And</a> let's see, I just want to see if we have one more. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5806.744s">Oh,</a> I just, I also wanted to know, is there any communication, like I know that the students, they, you know, they're not allowed to make phone calls home or like, or tweet or anything like that, or is there a way where parents can follow <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5820.443s">or</a> pictures are seen like on Twitter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5822.885s">Does</a> any of that happen while they're on the trip, whether teachers might post it or the field trip advisor?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mn4KS2yu_8U&t=5851.754s">I</a> hope you enjoy.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=98.312s">I</a> just have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=100.555s">There</a> was just a couple of items that were unclassified. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=105.439s">Let's</a> see. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=106.1s">It</a> was on page two. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=108.482s">Equipment,</a> other, BMCA 2006-25. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=115.226s">I</a> can recognize that. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=116.708s">Yes,</a> good evening.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=119.43s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=120.852s">And</a> then on page four, Bill and Associates had four items that were just on other supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=131.043s">That's</a> for the pool, pool supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=132.905s">OK,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=832.714s">School</a> committee woman, Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=833.994s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=835.414s">I</a> wanted to know, because we had talked about it, Erin DiBenedetto, she was a former school committee member, she had motioned last year at the end of the presentations that we were going to record the pre-budget meetings, because there were so many people that didn't know we even had the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=854.039s">So</a> I wanted to make a motion to <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=857.116s">record</a> the pre-budget meetings that we're going to have in room 207. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=861.76s">Of</a> course, making sure and ensuring that the recording equipment is turned off at the end of our Committee of the Whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=867.745s">I</a> know that Vice Chair Russo sent us a message last week sharing some details about <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=875.96s">another</a> community that had their recording equipment kept on during their executive session. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=881.823s">And</a> I'm not sure how we go about doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=884.005s">I</a> don't know who controls turning it on, but I did talk to City Councilor Riccariello yesterday, and all of their pre-budget meetings are recorded in room 207 when they have their pre-budget meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=899.096s">So</a> I just wanted to reiterate that and for transparency so that everybody's welcome to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=906.4s">Even</a> if they can't get there, they could watch from home or at their convenience. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=912.102s">Is</a> that something that we're going to definitely do?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=947.626s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=948.026s">And</a> I just had one other minor request, if possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=952.088s">Once</a> we have the final approved dates, can we put the dates, I don't know if it's possible, on the website underneath our regular school committee dates, so that if people forgot what dates they are, they'll be somewhere <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=965.515s">where</a> people can just easily go and look at them and maybe we could share it with the press release if we could ask Lisa Evangelista if she could put together a press release once the dates are finalized if these are the tentative dates and we could just share it via social media to engage the public a little bit more because last year people didn't know about them so I'm trying to get the word out there this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=987.626s">Is</a> that a motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=988.887s">Yeah</a> that'll be I guess a second motion a second motion to <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=993.714s">put</a> together a press release to share the dates so people can share them on social media. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=998.217s">And</a> if possible, I don't know if there's room on the website to fit the dates underneath our regular school committee meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1005.342s">I</a> don't know the structure of the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1007.924s">So</a> that's why I'm not sure about that, but if you could check into that.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1012.867s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1706.123s">And</a> I did read that I guess a handout was developed for the students with the education like to help them Is that something that you would be able to share with us like to just see it would be you know, interesting to read about sure Thank you Thank you, thank you and miss stone

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3696.359s">School</a> committee woman Kreatz hi, thank you very much for the report, and I definitely look forward to the <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3702.378s">fair</a> again this year, and I would love to volunteer, so you can put me down. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3706.821s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3707.421s">And</a> it's great to hear that the bank was out to speak to the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3713.625s">I</a> think I was talking about that over the last couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3718.589s">Some</a> students, and even my own son had come to me when he got out of high school, and he didn't know how to write a check or what to do with his bank account. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3728.642s">So</a> I was wondering if that's something that we could do for the high school seniors, just adding a presentation to invite maybe one of the local banks to come out and just do a brief demo on banking. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3742.274s">I</a> know I attended at the vocational program, I think one of the students had come back and talked to <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3749.782s">some</a> of the students but I'm not sure like what bank it was but it was something like I've been you know kind of asking about for a while just you know writing a check you know <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3761.09s">what's</a> involved with going to the bank and what type of identification you need and protecting your PIN and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3767.674s">And</a> just kind of throwing it out there if it's something that, not like right away, but like something that could be for maybe next year or something like that, just another seminar. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3778.62s">It</a> wouldn't be the same day, obviously. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=3782.141s">But</a> no, thank you very much, and definitely, I'm sincere, and I just, definitely put me down for volunteer, for sure.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=4326.447s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=4326.847s">Thank</a> you Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=4327.267s">Calzo</a> for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=4328.948s">I</a> did serve on the committee and it was all the applications, they were just so interesting and I wanted to give everybody something. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=4337.031s">It</a> was very difficult to make your decision and it was for the first time grant, we were able to give out 27 applicants and we had 37. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=4348.295s">So</a> I just wanna say, encourage anybody who is a nonprofit to <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=4354.337s">apply</a> next year, put it on your calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=4357.139s">You</a> can get anywhere between $1,000 to $10,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=4360.84s">And</a> the application should come out annually around, annually a little bit either on September 30th or a little bit after into October. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=4372.987s">And</a> just thank everybody for all their hard work in filling out the applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=4377.719s">meeting</a> the deadlines and they were all very interesting and everybody, you know, I wish I could give everybody something and, you know, I encourage you to apply again next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=4386.992s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=4474.543s">Devaney</a> she did the press release and it was on the website as soon as we had the it was a first-time application so we had to design it so as soon as the application was ready we put the press release out there and it was shared you know on Facebook all the social media and it was it was on the website that's how it was done thank you yep and then that then when we got the deadline date ready we posted that as well and <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=4502.121s">And,</a> you know, I was really overwhelmed and surprised with how many applicants we got. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=4507.408s">We</a> didn't know how many we were going to get. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=4508.83s">And</a> it was really nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=4511.293s">It</a> was a nice turnout. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=4513.0s">You</a> know, everybody did a great job.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=4587.635s">Any</a> questions about one of the reports that was provided? <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=4593.578s">I</a> think it was one of the old reports that was on the, I guess it was on the list of the back of the requested reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=4600.242s">It</a> was the report on mathematics middle school supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=4606.225s">So</a> I just wanted to, while we're entering into the pre-budget season, this year I think we all heard from teachers who had to buy <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=4614.93s">supplies</a> for manipulatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=4617.472s">I'm</a> sorry, it's hard to say that word for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=4619.473s">Manipulatives</a> such as dice, beads, blocks, measuring cups. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=4625.016s">So</a> I just want to make sure that going into the pre-budget season that we consider these items in the mathematics supplies department because teachers shouldn't have to go out and buy the supplies so that their students can do some of the experiments that they <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=4643.885s">you</a> know, have to do as part of the curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=4647.257s">I</a> did hear that some of the students were asked to bring in <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=4650.996s">drink</a> mixes so that they could measure the water in drink cups, and it would be able to see the different levels with different colors. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=4658.377s">So</a> I mean, they aren't very expensive things, but if we can just find a way to kind of maybe even ask for donations from people if they want to donate certain supplies, if there isn't enough money in the budget for the additional supplies, but we should really try to build something in the budget so that there's enough for the supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=4679.482s">I</a> just wanted to add that.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=4693.767s">Yeah,</a> just as we enter into the new upcoming pre-budget season.<h2><a href="../2020-01-08_RCBmbH4HOvE/2020-01-08_RCBmbH4HOvE.html">Medford School Committee January 6, 2020 meeting</a></h2>

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=506.959s">The</a> rules subcommittee had a meeting this evening at 6.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=513.726s">and</a> we met to vote and vote on the member public schools attendance policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=520.493s">What</a> I can give everybody in their packets, everybody received over the weekend, <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=525.758s">Some</a> documents, three documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=527.039s">The</a> first document was the Medford Public Schools attendance policy that is currently on the MAS website. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=533.481s">The</a> second document is the attendance policy that we received from the MASC, which is their updated policy dated February 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=542.503s">We</a> use this policy as a guideline when updating the Medford Public Schools attendance policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=548.103s">The</a> MASE attendance policy is adopted by neighboring districts such as Seminole, Winchester, and several other districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=555.828s">The</a> third document in your packet is the proposed updated member public schools policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=561.131s">I'm</a> just going to summarize some of the updates that are in <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=564.863s">the</a> policy that's the last, the third document in your packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=568.584s">So</a> the school committee had, I'm sorry, not the school committee, the subcommittee had a meeting earlier in, at the end of October, and we went with all the administrators, and we, after that meeting, Paul Russo got in touch with Jim Hardy at the MASC, and he asked the MASC if they could share their attendance policy with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=591.894s">So</a> Paul got that document from Jim Hardy. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=595.077s">We</a> made just a few changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=597.6s">We</a> added the word caregivers to all the paragraphs throughout the document wherever you see parents, guardians, wherever that's referenced you'll see caregivers as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=605.968s">We</a> separated the section unexcused absence so it stands out. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=609.772s">Additionally</a> the language was updated to show the new verbiage discussed in the subcommittee meeting on 10.1. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=616.015s">stating</a> the consequences for unexcused absences are limited to the same day restrictions on participation in extracurricular activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=624.481s">Lastly,</a> a policy information section was added at the bottom left-hand corner of the document. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=629.745s">so</a> we can track the version, date, and approved policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=632.969s">Going</a> forward, this is something that will appear on all newly updated policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=639.497s">The</a> document was reviewed by each principal at each school, as well as the superintendent, Dr. Edouard-Vincent, associate superintendent Peter Cushing, <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=649.809s">Associate</a> Superintendent Diane Caldwell, Headmaster DeLeva. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=654.011s">We</a> shared this document with everybody, including all the original attendees at the October 1st meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=662.056s">So</a> they all received and reviewed the document electronically via Google Docs, and they made suggestions, comments, or updates as needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=670.54s">So</a> what you're looking at is the proposed <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=674.976s">updated</a> Medford Public Schools attendance policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=678.198s">At</a> our subcommittee meeting this evening, there was just one minor update. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=683.282s">So</a> if you pull out the, I guess I numbered the pages, so it's the fourth page, I think, in your document. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=690.888s">So</a> the last paragraph on the fourth page <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=694.29s">That</a> last paragraph where it says each principal or designee will notify a student's parent, guardian, caregiver within three, we added the word school during our subcommittee meeting, school days of the student's absence in the event the parent, caregiver has not informed the school's absence. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=711.254s">So</a> that was the one minor update. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=713.755s">And</a> the attendance policy was I motion to accept to move over to the regular committee tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=720.256s">And</a> Mr. Russo seconded. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=724.497s">At</a> this time, I'd like to make a motion to approve this document so that we can get this posted on the Medford Public Schools website and then share with the MASC as our new updated policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=737.087s">so</a> they can put the updated policy on their website.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=742.792s">Oh,</a> yes, there was, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=744.053s">And</a> I'm sorry, I didn't say that, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=745.835s">That's</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=746.556s">So</a> there was a vote, and there was none in the affirmative, I'm sorry, two in the affirmative, zero negative, and there was one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=757.646s">So</a> it was the motion passed.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=760.522s">Nice</a> job. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=761.403s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3446.532s">Oh,</a> hi. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3448.574s">Thank</a> you very much for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3450.215s">It's</a> one of my favorite presentations, and the annual report is beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3454.739s">I</a> just want to thank the students for the great job and the great work they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3458.342s">The</a> pictures are beautiful, the articles, just perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3461.624s">All</a> the projects presented tonight were fantastic, and I did what Paulette says, I look forward to <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3467.629s">all</a> the upcoming events and just going to all the presentations and it's just so wonderful and the kids are so excited and it's so exciting that they're starting in elementary and then going to middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3478.179s">I</a> can't imagine the upcoming years what we're going to see in the upper grades because these children are starting younger now and it's their idea, their vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3488.468s">their</a> voice, and you know, I just heard so many students at the presentations last year, they speak so well, and their leadership skills, and they're great speakers, public speakers, better than me sometimes, so I'm really impressed with the students and all the presentations, and thank you all so much.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4303.726s">Yes,</a> I just had one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4305.787s">Oh,</a> Molly, I was just, I was curious about, so the stipend student, like the student stipend, what would the students be doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4311.751s">Like,</a> I was just curious about that.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4323.438s">Okay,</a> okay, great, that's great, thank you.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4735.394s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4735.634s">Kurtz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4737.175s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Cushing, and thank Christine Patterson and Mr. McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4741.579s">This</a> is great news. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4743.72s">I</a> just wanted to know, it says on the back, please note your official start date will be the date that your return contract is signed and dated and will terminate on December 31st. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4753.742s">Does</a> that mean, like, do all the funds have to be spent by December 31st? <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4759.805s">Or</a> is it, you know, I guess you have to accept, sign the contract by, that was like on, I guess on the letter.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5308.734s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5309.154s">Thank</a> you very much for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5311.194s">And</a> I had an opportunity to go to the Brooks Elementary and volunteer at the after school program a couple weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5318.836s">And</a> I had a great time. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5320.497s">And</a> I was really impressed with how well the program, it's so well structured. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5325.426s">organized</a> and very safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5327.869s">There</a> was a teacher aide, has a walkie talkie. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5331.615s">The</a> teacher has a walkie talkie. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5333.598s">Everybody's</a> communicating via walkie. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5335.321s">It</a> was so, it was like really incredible to participate in. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5339.267s">And</a> I got to <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5340.708s">go</a> to the outside activity time, homework time, story time, we did some arts and crafts. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5346.03s">It</a> was just a wonderful, you know, I had a wonderful experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5348.971s">The</a> only concern I had is, you know, I know there's a wait list, and the concern I have is, you know, if we were to fill those spots, like let's say overnight we filled, we got five new teachers, where would those students go? <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5361.716s">That's</a> something that I observed was that there's a lack of space. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5366.878s">for</a> the after school program. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5368.58s">So</a> like they don't have access to the whole school. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5371.662s">So</a> there's limited classrooms that they can go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5374.865s">So</a> I'm looking at the wait list and I don't know where those students would go. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5379.449s">Like</a> if we could put them in tomorrow, I don't know where those books, you know, where the 35 students would go. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5385.154s">I</a> mean if we got five teachers and, you know, everybody's going to be in a classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5389.638s">Where</a> would they go? <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5391.578s">I'm</a> just thinking, is there a plan to increase the space? <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5398.26s">Even</a> one of the teachers I was talking to said, maybe a mobile classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5403.141s">I</a> mean, I don't know if that's an idea because it would be a little bit chaotic in the gym with everybody in the gym. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5411.842s">And</a> there was just those little setups. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5414.283s">I</a> know I've seen them sometimes in CCD class where they <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5416.663s">can</a> have the dividers, but I'm just curious, is anybody looking into a plan for spacing, because the numbers are growing dramatically, for the Brooks especially. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5427.694s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5496.662s">And</a> I just, I know there's a lot of high school students that, you know, that would be interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5501.564s">And</a> I just happen to know that the pay that they're, you know, that they're paid is lower than the minimum wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5508.206s">And,</a> you know, I think that maybe if we, we could attract more high school students. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5514.935s">Oh,</a> okay, so maybe it is minimum wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5516.896s">No,</a> I thought, I was told that it was 11.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5524.761s">Or</a> maybe, maybe, was it higher than, like was it maybe more than minimum wage and maybe did the rate go down?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5538.305s">By</a> January. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5539.425s">So</a> even these high school students will be going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5543.166s">So</a> that might just be some confusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5544.727s">But</a> there was another concern that was brought up that the high school students can only work until 530 instead of the 6 o'clock hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5552.029s">And</a> I just didn't know if there was a reason why, like a rule that we have to follow.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1518.652s">That's</a> not our policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1519.873s">And</a> we did talk about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1521.653s">The</a> differences between the policy is very broad. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1525.155s">It's</a> one that can fit all schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1528.357s">But</a> the procedures are individual procedures for each school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1532.899s">And</a> the four elementary schools have one unique procedure. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1537.861s">The</a> two middle schools are working towards having one. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1542.644s">But</a> that's all with the school district and administrators. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1545.085s">And</a> we don't set those procedures, no.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1548.745s">You're</a> welcome.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1620.763s">The</a> superintendent's going to get copies for all the members of the subcommittee so you can start working. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1630.974s">The</a> meeting in June and we met several times and we updated several chapters of policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1639.284s">It's</a> very time consuming, and we met in over many hours in June, and then it was summer break, and then we came back, and we've been meeting, not like in the policy meetings, but then this was set forth to come to the subcommittee, so we have to get back to where we were. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1661.399s">We've</a> already begun working on updating the policies, <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1666.311s">You</a> know, it's really time consuming, so we've done, I think we've done like chapters one to... <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1674.358s">Yeah,</a> hold on one second. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1675.639s">If</a> I could just look at my notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1676.859s">That's</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1677.139s">Yeah,</a> I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1678.08s">It's</a> a work in progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1679.5s">Yeah,</a> it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1680.14s">It's</a> just it's quite time consuming.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1694.946s">The</a> ones that we already approved in June, we haven't. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1698.068s">This</a> one, we haven't approved the policy yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1700.489s">That's</a> why the meeting we just had, you were in this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1704.584s">We</a> did not approve the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1707.367s">Paul</a> is going to obtain.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1711.532s">But</a> then once we have it and we have it customized, I'm going to bring it forth to the regular meeting.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1786.152s">Oh,</a> yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1787.273s">So</a> I was thinking, I heard from Mr. Russo and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1790.415s">Van</a> der Kloot, and so I was wondering, I was thinking that in the future, if we knew early enough, could we plan like a civic field trip where maybe one of the teachers could go along with the students and go into town with parent permission <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1807.03s">to</a> go into the strike or, you know, the protest with adult supervision and as long as they had their parental permissions.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1890.578s">And</a> do you know how many students <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1893.36s">do</a> we know if any students attended the strike that day? <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1896.962s">Another</a> parent had asked me, she said, do you know how many students? <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1900.383s">Or</a> we don't know.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1921.693s">And</a> do you know if during the day were there discussions maybe at, you know, at civic class or history class to just talk about the climate strike with the students? <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1933.041s">I</a> was just, I also received that question from parents, like did they actually engage in discussion?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2025.396s">And</a> I just had one more, because I know, I think it was last year, where there was a walk-in, where the students didn't actually walk out, but they were allowed to walk into the gymnasium or the cafeteria for about 10 to 15 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2038.642s">It</a> was like a safe walk, where they could do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2041.723s">That</a> was another idea that we could do if the students still wanted to have a strike, they could do it within the school at a certain time. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2050.847s">But</a> that was just a suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2054.069s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3243.993s">And</a> I would be happy to chair the subcommittee.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3255.762s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3256.042s">So</a> yes, I did talk with Mayor about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3259.764s">And</a> even Mr. Brown, he is interested on serving as a volunteer on the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3266.169s">And</a> he can bring his expertise to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3269.732s">We</a> also want to have some ideas, just brainstorming. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3273.895s">doing</a> some tours, walking around the school, and just putting together a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3280.162s">We</a> know that we're waiting for the MSBA interest statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3283.405s">We're</a> hoping to get that, but I think what a lot of people want to do is just have a discussion, start talking about things, and putting together a plan, and then prioritizing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3295.197s">So</a> I do know that currently some of the CTE programs are currently reconfiguring to their new spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3302.92s">And</a> it would be nice to even, you know, share some of those stories and we can bring it back to the regular committee and just tell everybody what's going on in those, you know, those areas that are reconfiguring and what the status is in progress and maybe something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3319.107s">And</a> we could have like a Google document where we could, you know, have a timetable. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3323.969s">This</a> is where we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3325.302s">You</a> know, this is where we want to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3327.223s">This</a> is when we get the MSBA statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3329.924s">Here's</a> the five-year capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3331.305s">It's</a> like a lot of planning involved, so it would be a lot of like mini-meetings to just track the progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3336.247s">But</a> yeah, so that's about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3338.028s">Yeah,</a> no problem.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5444.513s">And</a> he also, there's two crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5448.148s">not</a> crosswalks, I'm sorry, stop signs that are in their parking lot that are all faded out. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5452.412s">He</a> said he has two and he can swap them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5454.634s">Perfect.</a> 
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5794.47s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5795.17s">I</a> just had a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5796.772s">I</a> know I've heard that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5799.134s">there</a> is an increased class size in the vocational numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5802.975s">And</a> it's hard to tell because we're only seeing the total number here, the 322, which is the combined number. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5811.577s">So</a> I'm wondering, I mean, if we could just get a breakdown of, you know, the number of students enrolled in the program, maybe at, you know, just an updated report.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5860.337s">Wow,</a> 207 in CTE. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5861.938s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5862.179s">Ms.</a>

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15097.285s">It's</a> impossible. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15098.805s">That's</a> why I think we could order 100 textbooks.<h2><a href="../2019-05-08_L6pSsRE1l3g/2019-05-08_L6pSsRE1l3g.html">Medford School Committee meeting May 6, 2019</a></h2>

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3695.348s">On</a> Monday, February 11th, we had a meeting to discuss the final changes for the functions of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3708.021s">We</a> made a couple of slight changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3710.883s">One</a> change was made to the first paragraph, another change was made to the last, I'm sorry, yeah, change was made to the first paragraph, and a change was made to the last sentence, number five. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3721.069s">We</a> finally came to an agreement, and we have the final version, which I have here tonight, and I'll circulate it to get signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3729.214s">I</a> will read the final draft, the function of the Medford School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3734.217s">We,</a> the members of the Medford School Committee, are committed to working together to provide the best opportunity for our children, their families, and the residents of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3743.022s">To</a> this end, we aim to meet the needs of all of our students and to nurture their achievement. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3748.885s">While</a> we understand that consensus can be elusive as we work together, we affirm the following principles. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3755.389s">Deliberations</a> of our committee are conducted in accordance with the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3759.832s">When</a> directed, one member may publicly report, but no one member of the school committee acts alone on our behalf. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3767.178s">Committee</a> members may issue public reports when appropriate based upon their role in the subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3773.102s">Our</a> superintendent is responsible for operating our schools and for the daily implementation of our policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3779.327s">Communication</a> is facilitated and managed by our superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3783.63s">As</a> elected members of the school committee, we should always engage in civil discourse. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3787.991s">We</a> aspire to make our meetings informative and productive. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3791.471s">We</a> agree to discuss the issues on the agenda in accordance with the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3796.252s">All</a> members will honor the consensus of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3799.493s">And</a> this is it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3800.393s">We're</a> done.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3819.018s">Yes,</a> second.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3839.759s">Yes,</a> so we had another Rules Subcommittee on February 25th. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3844.626s">The</a> purpose of our meeting was to discuss the Medford Public Schools Responsible Use Policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3850.314s">So</a> what we did was we discussed <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3852.497s">what</a> items in the policy that maybe needed additional professional development, and we also asked Molly Ladin, who is the director of technology, if the rules that are posted on the website are officially <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3869.97s">updated</a> and they are up to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3873.392s">We</a> did ask to switch out, there's a URL and the URL says acceptable use policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3879.797s">However,</a> the document says responsible use. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3882.979s">So</a> we've asked for that update. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3884.881s">We</a> did, Mr. Russo asked if <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3887.402s">A</a> blacklist could be imposed to block out social media networks. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3892.626s">Superintendent</a> Edouard-Vincent cautioned that social media sites like YouTube can be educational. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3899.112s">The</a> district uses social media, so it's difficult to prohibit. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3903.375s">And</a> we also do a lot of updates to notify our community about what's happening in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3910.484s">So</a> we just need to use guidance versus restriction. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3914.388s">Also,</a> we just wanted to reiterate that Instagram is an account <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3920.471s">that</a> should not be open for under, I'm sorry, I'm just tired, for account for 13 years under 13 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3929.977s">I'm</a> sorry, I'm getting tired. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3933.339s">And</a> so, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3934.2s">Ladin,</a> she mentioned that each year the responsible use policy is discussed with the new staff at the beginning of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3941.804s">The</a> Children's Internet Protection Act says that social media is not banned. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3946.447s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3946.687s">Ladin</a> notes that there are no protections out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3949.45s">We</a> just need to educate and make whatever you're posting as private as you can. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3954.414s">If</a> you're under 13 years old, the students should not be using social media. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3959.878s">One</a> of the parents that attended, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3961.78s">Todfeld,</a> brought up some concerns about using Instagram for submitting homework assignments in middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3968.926s">This</a> isn't safe because there is an explore button that cannot be turned off. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3974.81s">Mr.</a> Russo noted that Instagram can be accessed via the website or the app. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3979.774s">It's</a> open to the worldwide web, and that's why it's a little dangerous for that, you know, that group of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3985.538s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3985.758s">Latin</a> said that there must be an educational reason for, you know, teachers in classrooms to get the technology tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3992.543s">All</a> software must be approved by the technology department. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3996.146s">Google</a> Classrooms is a safe product. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3998.547s">It's</a> closed, and external emails are not allowed K to 8. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=4002.658s">Superintendent</a> Dr. Vincent noted that technology and education go hand in hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=4007.583s">We</a> need to remind the middle school's administration and teachers social media sites like Instagram are not legal for students under 13. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=4015.05s">Also,</a> we must consider students' access. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=4017.432s">Some</a> don't have computers or devices, so they can't access the material to submit their homework. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=4024.139s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=4024.339s">Taubville</a> would like to see more education for teachers and administrators. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=4029.442s">Social</a> media is addictive by nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=4031.703s">We</a> want to be smart, savvy, and wait a little longer to introduce students to social media. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=4036.706s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=4036.906s">Caldwell</a> noted that it's top priority to discuss with teachers and administrators at the upcoming meetings and provide additional professional development. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=4045.611s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=4045.831s">Ladin</a> informed us that everything in the building is monitored and archived. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=4050.054s">All</a> emails can be recovered, <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=4051.855s">Student</a> logins begin at 6th grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=4054.656s">Mr.</a> Russo asked if there's filtering to block sites, and there is. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=4058.517s">Yes,</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=4059.117s">Lund</a> responded yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=4061.238s">The</a> meeting ended with just adding a responsible use of, oh, with adding the date, left that word out. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=4068.04s">Also,</a> there's just going to be a review every two years and currently is up to date, so there's no updates that are necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=4073.822s">And</a> our meeting adjourned.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5682.602s">I</a> also have a conflict with April 4th and I'm out of town on March 21st and one of the other dates is a school committee meeting night May 6 so if the meeting was 6 to 7 30 we would probably have to move the time up or have it at the at City Hall <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5700.11s">and</a> have it earlier and finish directly before the school committee meeting, that could work. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5705.993s">We</a> could keep it that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5708.654s">I'm</a> not sure, but I'm happy to go to the meetings, and that's why I wanted to see if we can change the two dates and swap it out with another date.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5743.146s">Oh,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5743.606s">Cause</a> I thought we were, cause I, it said that we were, <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5748.279s">approval</a> of the schedules recommended to plan the meetings.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6604.931s">I</a> like the idea of this process tremendously.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6812.509s">I</a> just had a suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6816.453s">I</a> know the dates when we have the committee of holes on Monday before the school committee meetings, we're all attending the school committee meeting, and we can usually all make those meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6827.242s">If</a> we had it, it would just probably be from 6 to 7.<h2><a href="../2019-02-25_TWpH9s-16mQ/2019-02-25_TWpH9s-16mQ.html">Medford School Committee February 11, 2019 meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5084.938s">I</a> would like to. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5086.299s">I'm</a> going to second because I have it written down here that we've always had school choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5092.963s">And</a> I'm a little surprised that there's not going to be a selection form. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5099.167s">And</a> that's something that I think <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5101.451s">like</a> the elementary students have always looked forward to getting ready to fill out that middle school selection form. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5107.817s">And</a> you know, talking with their friends and picking their schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5111.84s">And</a> so we have students right now that are in fifth grade that might have been looking forward to doing that and they're not gonna get that opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5120.388s">I</a> feel like this is, I mean, I think it's a great way to, you know, to keep <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5126.973s">everything</a> unbiased and keep everybody in the different schools and meeting everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5132.215s">But</a> at the same time, it's a very difficult time, you know, moving from elementary school to middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5139.878s">And</a> we didn't have any prior information about this, so I wasn't expecting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5146.06s">I</a> thought maybe we were going to be doing something like we did last year where <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5150.439s">the</a> school would, you know, the students would fill out their forms, and if there wasn't enough enrollment, then we would do the lottery, the partial lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5158.967s">And,</a> because we did talk about last year that the McGlynn students mostly wanted, is selected, the McGlynn elementary schools because they felt comfortable there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5169.435s">But</a> I do understand it's tough because I understand that you want to split them up to meet other students and they're going to meet them in high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5178.02s">It's</a> a little, you know, I'm a little, you know, concerned myself and just a little bit unsure, you know, what's the process and how is the public going to take this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5189.147s">And,</a> you know, I'm just thinking about that we have school choice and now we're not going to give them that school choice.<h2><a href="../2019-02-08_XIqbZ6WsGvA/2019-02-08_XIqbZ6WsGvA.html">Medford School Committee meeting February 4, 2019</a></h2>

Oops, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1710.521s">I</a> just knocked that off. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1711.481s">I'll</a> put that back in a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1713.762s">Mention</a> that when the payroll is sent into the Mass Teachers Retirement System, the total checks and everybody on that file, it's an electronic file, has to match up. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1727.406s">And</a> it's audited at the Mass Teachers Retirement System. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1732.641s">well,</a> the reporting system that we have, has checks and balances in place to pick up on, for example, if somebody went on a leave of absence, or if somebody maybe got an extra check, and something like that might kick out, and that gets audited by the employer services area, and then questions are sent down to the school, and either it's explained, or maybe somebody got an extra check because they were working in one department, they earned the stipend, <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1763.0s">and</a> the other person didn't get turned off, so there might be an adjustment on one person, and then a correction made. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1768.561s">Things</a> like that happen very often. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1772.302s">But</a> I know that our payroll software, when it comes through, picks up deductions omitted if somebody is missing and their deductions weren't turned on, which means they might be getting paid, but no deductions were taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1786.244s">But</a> this is just generic. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1788.084s">I'm</a> just talking about I have a lot of districts, and we do... <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1793.333s">a</a> very detailed audit and audit every single report in all the, you know, all the public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1801.034s">And</a> then we are audited by, you know, PARAC and KPMG, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1807.676s">So</a> the reports are going through those audits and so is Medford Public Schools or they randomly pick school districts to audit. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1814.697s">KPMG</a> does, you know, and they audit the reports that are sent in and they do an audit with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1820.378s">We</a> don't know what questions they're asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1822.082s">and</a> they do not with us, and you don't know what questions that they're asking us. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1825.863s">And</a> then both of us have to give back up to the auditors.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4421.514s">I</a> have a simple question. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4425.215s">I</a> think Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4426.435s">Ray,</a> she shared an article with us over the December break, and Mr. DeLaver did as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4432.542s">And</a> it does say that the Juul has as much nicotine as 20 cigarettes, like a pack of. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4440.226s">And</a> then also, I read that what is in a vape, which is really, really, it sounds horrible, is it exposes your lungs to acriline, which is mostly used in acrylic acid, which is something that is a nail polish remover, that we would take our nail polish off with. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4459.876s">And</a> that's what's in <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4461.942s">the</a> vape, one of the most common ingredients, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4466.366s">It's</a> just something that is very toxic and irritating, causes upper respiratory tract, and it's just not good, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4478.076s">So,</a> I mean, I did read that there are some schools that have, you know, the FDA has posters <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4484.869s">And</a> they're putting them in the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4486.97s">And</a> I mean, I don't know if we have any of these posters in our bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4493.174s">Or</a> do we have any reports or numbers of what is happening in our school? <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4501.279s">Because</a> it also has a little bit information about the vaping devices. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4506.562s">And</a> a lot of schools are rolling those out. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4509.704s">And</a> do they work? <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4512.128s">do</a> they really detect if the kids are going into the bathroom? <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4516.149s">Do</a> these vaping devices detect the students using the vapes?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4547.182s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4549.284s">But</a> we'll talk about things after Dr. Schuster. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4551.726s">There</a> was just one other thing I thought was really frightening is that it says that currently right now they are developing hands-free vaping hoodies and backpacks with integrated vaping delivery systems so that they could be vaping in classroom hands-free. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4569.759s">And</a> we don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4571.565s">And</a> it's all built into their hoodie or their backpack. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4575.666s">And</a> they're odorless. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4577.507s">I</a> mean, I don't know how we can tell who's in a classroom who's walking down a hallway here or anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4586.41s">It's</a> just scary.<h2><a href="../2018-12-20_R49wqTZ5YIg/2018-12-20_R49wqTZ5YIg.html">Medford School Committee meeting Monday, December 17, 2018</a></h2>

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2506.568s">Okay,</a> so last week I signed off on an invoice for, it sounds like a very exciting program that took place over the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2514.47s">Miranda</a> Wilson from the Miffitt Transcript, she taught the students, the CCSR students, she led a journalism workshop for students at Miffitt High School in August, and the students completed the project of writing and publishing a newspaper article. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2530.234s">I</a> thought it was so interesting and I thought it was great, something that they were doing in the summer that was educational <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2535.529s">I</a> just wanted to share with everybody.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3222.445s">And</a> we discussed the final draft copy function of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3227.909s">We</a> were struggling with one of the functions, number five. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3231.712s">So</a> between our last meeting and this meeting, I went in and I met with city solicitor Mark Rumley, <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3242.321s">to</a> get some help with him on the wording of what the possible consequences could be for a school committee member who was in violation of one of the policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3253.889s">So</a> we reviewed the draft together and I came up with the new number five, which I put a copy in front of each of your tables this evening due to the last minute meeting that we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3266.379s">We</a> also had another meeting this evening from 6 to 618 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3273.205s">so</a> that we could vote on the new final draft, including the updates to number five, and also including some different wording because we want to make sure that we weren't in violation with the law or the First Amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3291.34s">So</a> what you have in front of you right now is what was <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3295.32s">looked</a> at by City Solicitor Mark Rumley, and he said that the way it reads right now, we are in violation with the law in the First Amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3305.104s">So</a> if everybody was in agreement with it, what we could do is we could, you know, ask maybe if we could put it on school letterhead, and then we could sign it at one of the future meetings, if there's something that you want to see in it differently, or if you have an idea that you wanted to see in it, <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3324.072s">You</a> know, we'd be happy to hear from you.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5556.71s">And</a> there was one comment that I really liked, and it talked about the cleanliness of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5563.534s">I</a> was, you know, really impressed because that's something that we don't hear a lot about. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5567.656s">So</a> that was something that I was excited about. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5570.797s">I'm</a> just going to try to find it here.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5575.88s">I</a> was, wow, that was amazing, you know.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5581.723s">So</a> I just wanted to, you know, I mean, I really appreciate the survey results and, you know, thank you very much, both of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5588.227s">Thank</a> you.

Has anybody asked the administration, like, what are their thoughts or views, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6573.641s">Before</a> we just jump right in and making a decision that we're going to have meetings on Saturdays, I was just curious what was done behind the scenes, because I haven't received any inquiries from parents asking to have a Saturday meeting either. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6585.826s">So</a> it came to me as, what is this all about? <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6588.307s">I</a> didn't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6588.927s">I</a> was confused because it was almost the message we got was mentioning that <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6594.565s">there</a> was a lot of communication between school committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6598.046s">And</a> I was just wondering who, because I haven't been communicating on it or receiving messages myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6603.307s">And</a> I just, it brought up more questions, for example, sports and church, you know, athlete dancing and band. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6610.949s">And</a> those are going to be other reasons why parents can't come to the Saturday school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6616.231s">Weddings,</a> communions, birthdays, like it just goes on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6619.772s">Like</a> there's more events on the weekends, Saturdays especially, <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6624.251s">doctor's</a> appointments, dentist appointments. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6625.872s">I</a> know I tend to put my dentist appointments on Saturdays, you know, and a lot of families might. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6630.395s">I</a> mean, there's like, there's equally amount of reasons to have it on a Saturday, not have it on a Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6636.018s">You</a> know, it's just, I'm thinking maybe we should do a survey before we jump into making any decisions, and that's what I'm thinking.<h2><a href="../2018-10-17_DHppOEsfgwM/2018-10-17_DHppOEsfgwM.html">Medford School Committee meeting October 15, 2018</a></h2>

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=355.099s">I'm</a> sorry, I have an update, because I'd rather not be the general public. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=361.683s">The</a> slide that's on this is one soldier. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=364.785s">I</a> was going to mention the treasurer's report in one week. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=367.967s">That</a> should be coming up very shortly. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=369.427s">But</a> right now, game time, who's going to do the installation? <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=374.35s">They're</a> not doing the insulation, but the Parks Department's doing the insulation. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=378.412s">And</a> currently there is some trouble with the screws. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=381.674s">It's</a> just not lining up with the other piece of the slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=385.977s">So</a> John McLaughlin put a call in to Travis Barnes, who works at Game Time, and he's been out of town since September 17th. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=396.903s">And</a> so we're waiting for him to come back to town so we can come and take a look at the piece that was ordered <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=404.252s">to</a> find out why it's not fitting up with the original piece that was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=408.535s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=633.143s">I'm</a> going to hand it out to everybody, and I'm just going to have to read somebody's original report. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=639.608s">My</a> report ties into the report that Jonathan read from first reading, so I'm going to read that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=647.333s">So</a> over the summer, I had made a promise last whole year, at the end of the year, to go out to every elementary school in the Valley of Indianapolis diagram and do a full report. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=655.858s">And</a> that's exactly what I did over the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=657.338s">I</a> walked around the playgrounds and we put all this together about what we need to be done with the playgrounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=664.22s">What</a> everybody mentioned, and I mentioned that to the parents is that playground service is definitely part of the capital repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=669.722s">But</a> it's just something that I wanted to mention here that we need to think about for future budgets for the other elementary schools, except for the public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=680.683s">So,</a> on July 2nd, I met with the principal, and at their school, the next year he founds a very good, the landscaper's on contract, so the slugs in the community are very well-fed. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=697.42s">On</a> July 5th, I met with someone who treated two parents of all their slugs in the shelter system. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=703.57s">Some</a> of the things we talked about are replacing the broken section of the tube slide, feeding the puff squash, more squids, freeing both worms, adding mulch, etc. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=717.227s">the</a> other piece that was delivered, which was talked about on the slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=721.95s">It</a> was delivered on September 11th. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=723.632s">It's</a> currently sitting in the playground outlet of Columbus Elementary. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=727.034s">However,</a> there is a problem with it connecting to the other original piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=730.216s">So</a> John will often text me, contact me back and forth and relay more information to the audience that we're still reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=738.562s">Once</a> we have enough data, I'll update everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=741.224s">On</a> July 9th, we had the P.T. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=742.985s">Parrot</a> Show at Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=744.687s">We</a> had a similar discussion about <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=747.011s">I</a> want to give a shout out to Mr. Potters, the music teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=752.194s">He</a> volunteers his time and takes care of the garden, the flowers, the flowers, the bushes. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=757.598s">It</a> just looks beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=759.419s">And</a> it's so very pretty in the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=761.54s">You</a> can imagine in July. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=762.581s">On</a> July 16th, I met with the two parents and a friend named Karen Turney. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=767.884s">Some</a> of the things they discussed was a gorgeous live session in one of their pre-K <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=775.126s">playground</a> area, adding sand blocks, freshly cut signs, and landscaping and mulching. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=785.622s">What</a> I do is I run some pictures in a few clubs. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=788.423s">I</a> look at before and afters. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=789.664s">They're</a> very nice to look at and see the dramatic differences. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=794.366s">I</a> want to make John Gawthorne, I want to make Deanna Depney, Christine Patterson, Angel Guino, Juan Russo, Michelle Sesol, Michelle Rodriguez, Jenna Graham, Kara Church, Dr. Edouard-Vincent, Iria Burke, Leo Walter, <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=811.011s">Another</a> thing I wanted to do was, I wanted to just kind of build a kind of follow-up. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=817.056s">I've</a> been giving this stuff to the principals and I just wanted to go in and volunteer and be a vote to the volunteer partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=825.722s">So</a> I began doing that and I kind of made it up to the schools and then continued to schedule some of the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=833.042s">Also,</a> I wanted to just mention that I was at the American High School of Higher Information last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=838.184s">It</a> was a great turnout. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=839.684s">While</a> I was there, I stopped in to see my recent teachers of the high school in the location design. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=846.647s">I</a> wanted to share a very nice project that the students are working on in plasmatology. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=850.548s">One</a> of the teachers was there, and she, Lauren Skierada, and she showed me one of the projects they're working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=858.351s">It's</a> called the Airbook project. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=860.065s">The</a> students can pick any of them, choose a picture to recreate the style of the past on the practice desk. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=866.467s">And</a> it just came out wonderful, and it's something that the students really like doing, and it's just a lot of fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=873.568s">And</a> another thing I wanted to mention was if you're ever interested in having your hair or nails done, please, you know, feel free to contact Mr. Graves for an appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=884.91s">They</a> can get you to an appointment at 781-393-2139 at any time. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=889.731s">The</a> kids really like working on customers. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=892.671s">So</a> if you ever, you know, want to get your hair done, you know, feel free to reach out. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=896.85s">And</a> I have my team from the VTO teaching organization online forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=903.332s">We've</a> been emailing Molly Lattin, Allison Roseberry, Jenny Graham, Paul Roseau, and Dr. Maurice. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=911.193s">So</a> right now, what we know, the forum can be added to the website very easily. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=914.934s">Currently,</a> you still need to transfer the membership from Jenny Graham to a point person at public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=922.716s">So</a> we're still working on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=924.117s">I</a> think Karen mentioned that last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=926.277s">And</a> still no new update yet, but we're still working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=929.318s">So</a> as soon as we have another update, I'll let you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=933.999s">And</a> last week, I did hand out an ALF scholarship application for the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth graders. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=940.981s">I</a> handed out a form to all schools, but one is left to be deteriorated to one of the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=948.283s">And</a> I did have a question being, do we need to approve that at the school committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=966.206s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2018-09-20_4DO7qbmEtOM/2018-09-20_4DO7qbmEtOM.html">Medford School Committee meeting September 17, 2018</a></h2>
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=102.627s">I</a> wanted to just inform everybody during the summer, I was receiving feedback from both with the yearbook advisor, David Ambrosie. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=119.134s">And</a> there was a couple of students that were working with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=122.516s">to</a> implement a supplement package. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=126.439s">I'm</a> not sure if some of you are aware, but when the yearbook came out, there were some students that were omitted, and there were some pages that were sections of the yearbook that weren't really advertised a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=139.027s">For</a> example, the Mustang Mall and some of the vocational programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=143.57s">So</a> over the summer, Dave Ambrosie and a couple of students, which I'll name, worked together <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=150.545s">to</a> help put the supplement together. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=152.666s">And</a> last Friday, or last Thursday and last Friday, the supplement was mailed to all of the 2018 class of 2018 seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=162.408s">And</a> I brought it in, you know, I can share it and everybody can take a look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=165.989s">And</a> I want to give a heartfelt thank you because what David did was he actually hand delivered the yearbook to some families and actually brought it to their house to make sure they got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=176.571s">And</a> he's just really, he did a great job <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=179.213s">We</a> stayed in contact. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=180.253s">He</a> shared some of the proofs with me, and I got to see them before they went to print. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=184.235s">And</a> so I want to thank Dave Ambrosie, some of the students, Mia McGillicuddy, Avro Sequeria, I hope I pronounced it correctly, Carla DeStefano. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=200.04s">And</a> I just wanted to say thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=202.28s">And</a> one minor update, I know I told everybody in the email communication the slide was <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=208.241s">The</a> slide arrived for the Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=211.143s">Right</a> now, the Parks Department is working with Game Time because they're trying to fit it into the old slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=217.868s">So</a> they have been going back and forth with Game Time to find a solution for the slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=222.551s">And</a> one last update, and I plan to put this on the agenda coming up for the next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=230.137s">Over</a> the summer, I mentioned to everybody in another email that the Elks, Medford Malden Elks had reached out to me <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=238.105s">I'm</a> an ALCS member, and they wanted to let us know that they have a program, it's a scholarship program that's gonna be available for fifth, sixth graders, and seventh and eighth graders, where they can write an essay, and it will be a monetary, you know, kind of scholarship, monetary gift that they're gonna be awarded. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=257.458s">So</a> I have the packages that I can, you know, maybe give to Superintendent and, you know, Diane Caldwell, but I do think it's a new, <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=267.621s">you</a> know, essay scholarship program. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=269.082s">So</a> I think it would have to go on the agenda maybe for the next meeting, but I'm not too sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=275.986s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=277.007s">So</a> I can, I can, you know, what I'll do is I'll send an email and maybe hand the packet off tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=281.93s">Okay.</a>

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10116.755s">Yes,</a> I wanted to just bring up something that I found out from a parent in, <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10123.198s">I</a> knew we were struggling to get an HVAC teacher and I got the most recent update I got is that unfortunately they haven't received any applicants. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10136.701s">So</a> they do not have an HVAC teacher right now at the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10142.343s">And</a> a letter was sent home to all of the students that were enrolled in HVAC asking them to choose a different shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10153.23s">program</a> and you know I was I was you know I was kind of upset but I mean I guess the industry right now is I guess struggling with you know I heard back from Chad with a bunch of different vocational schools that are experiencing similar problems right now you know if the senior you know wants to pursue a co-op they can work with the co-op you know director <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10182.682s">to</a> help find a job, because they'll still be able to go for the co-op opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10186.764s">But</a> anybody who wanted to choose HVAC, freshman, sophomore, junior, they're not going to have that choice this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10195.647s">So</a> I was concerned and thinking about, are we going to maybe be sending our kids off to Minuteman if those students really want to enroll in HVAC, because that might be what they want to pursue, which is what we kind of do <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10212.166s">for</a> Essex Aggie or another program that we're not offering. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10216.21s">So</a> it's just something that we're going to have to start thinking about.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10229.543s">And</a> it's such a popular field and it's not going to go away. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10233.047s">We</a> need to have these young students learn and move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10237.338s">But</a> I know how hard, you know, it's still posted, the position is still posted.<h2><a href="../2018-06-19_kF4MfjuZkZ8/2018-06-19_kF4MfjuZkZ8.html">Medford School Committee meeting June 18, 2018</a></h2>
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=581.585s">I</a> just have a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=583.545s">I</a> want to thank the finance department, and I want to thank Christine Patterson, and I also want to thank City Hall, the finance department, for, you know, all their cooperation all year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=597.547s">What</a> they do is they put together the packets and they, you know, they actually put them together and they have every single invoice in the correct order. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=606.433s">And</a> so it makes it really easy for me to go through and verify those numbers and the addresses and the names all match up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=613.675s">And</a> they've just been extremely helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=615.836s">And</a> I actually go into the City Hall office, the finance department, and I sit in one of the vacant desks or in another office with somebody at one of the tables. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=626.039s">And</a> they've just been so accommodating with my schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=629.04s">And</a> everybody's just been fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=631.261s">If</a> I have questions, I send an email. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=634.642s">I</a> get answers right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=636.824s">Everybody</a> involved has been fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=638.626s">So</a> I just wanted to say thank you for a great first year doing the bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=643.592s">Thank</a> you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=644.212s">Kreatz.</a>

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2349.001s">Do</a> you know what the plan is for September if we don't have these teacher positions filled? <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2354.243s">Because</a> we have a teacher missing in cosmetology, <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2358.062s">construction,</a> there's a CCL teacher, well he's there, I'm sorry, he's there, I'm sorry, HVAC, there's a teacher, they're down, and then I know robotics and engineering will be down one teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2370.373s">And</a> I know just from experience with my son in that classroom, it's very busy and I know <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2375.919s">the</a> teacher that left was the teacher who did most of the machinery and CNC and like that is in a different room. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2383.743s">So</a> it's very dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2385.304s">Like</a> you can't have kids in that room operating on their own. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2388.286s">Um,</a> and then they're not going to learn the trade.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2435.938s">So</a> that was for the vocational, and so I wanted to bring up, there's been a lot of confusion, and I've been getting tagged on Facebook because I went out to the Brooks School, and when I went out to the Brooks School, I was invited, or we all were invited by the Brooks BTO, so I happened to have that day off, so I went to the Brooks School to just walk around, and we kind of put a list together <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2461.279s">and</a> I just wrote it up on paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2462.58s">It</a> was just a to-do list, a wish list, almost like what the teachers submitted, the principals submitted for their school improvement plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2471.023s">It</a> is a wish list. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2473.003s">Some</a> of the items on the list can be done, things like cutting the bushes, cleaning up the trash, cutting the grass. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2482.227s">Those</a> things can be done, and John McLaughlin has confirmed that things like that can be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2487.249s">So</a> the rumors on Facebook are that I've promised <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2491.007s">that</a> the dirt field is going to be replaced with a turf field. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2493.93s">And</a> I never made that promise to anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2496.994s">So</a> there's some confusion and there's some rumors flying around out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2500.898s">people</a> are upset with me and they're calling me and emailing me and I don't know what, I really honestly was just going out to put the to-do list together and we as a committee haven't approved anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2514.843s">It</a> was we can all go out and meet with the PTOs and that is one of my plans to do, but I just did that last week and then a lot of things have developed since then, so my plan is over the summer and a couple of us maybe can <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2529.383s">go</a> out and make a to-do list at each school and meet with the PTOs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2533.405s">I</a> still want to do that, but the timing of my visit to the Brooks and today's meeting, there hasn't been a lot of days in between that it gave me time to go out to the other schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2544.771s">And</a> that's a lot of schools to go out and visit and do a to-do list. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2548.132s">But</a> I'm definitely going to go out to all of the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2551.694s">And</a> I just want to clear up that confusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2554.155s">And</a> I'm not going to go back and forth with people on Facebook, so I'm just addressing it right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2560.142s">And</a> as I think the Mayor said, and Superintendent Baleson said, is that most of this is going to be coming from the capital funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2567.865s">So</a> it's a good idea that we put a list together, so we know, okay, so we have this big list, and it's broken down by different schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2576.633s">And</a> then we have to look at it and say, well, who's going to get funding and what and where? <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2581.415s">But</a> everybody will get funding, I'm sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2584.035s">And</a> I wasn't picking one school and only going to help that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2587.477s">I'm</a> going to help all schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2589.097s">I</a> just want to make that clear, because I've really been getting a lot of messages and just not so nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2596.88s">So</a> I just want to please, that was a misunderstanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2601.021s">I</a> don't know where some of that information came from. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2603.502s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2613.398s">Don't</a> take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2613.779s">Yeah,</a> so I know, and I plan to go out to the others. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2616.621s">You</a> know, it takes time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2617.682s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2618.082s">Yeah,</a> it takes time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2618.923s">Thank</a> you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2620.724s">Krutz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2621.305s">Yep,</a> and I just had one more, and I just have an update for another parent that was concerned about some folding chairs at the Roberts, and I will get in touch with that parent, but they do have chairs for all the students, <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2635.395s">and</a> there's only like one student that requires a folding chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2638.517s">So</a> everybody is all set and all the rugs have been replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2643.02s">So</a> I think that some of the information might just be a little outdated with some of the supplies that are at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2650.445s">One</a> thing that she did want me to mention is that the Roberts is actually short and they haven't been able to get <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2658.89s">money</a> for easel paper over the past two years, and the PTO has been buying the easel paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2665.976s">So</a> if there's any extra funding, you know, just a wish list, I wanted to just add that special note for them on behalf of the parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2675.044s">So</a> I just wanted to add that, and that's it for me.<h2><a href="../2018-05-22_ACxsV5H4ehA/2018-05-22_ACxsV5H4ehA.html">School Committee Meeting 05/21/18</a></h2>

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9261.0s">I</a> just had one more question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9262.801s">So</a> is the sibling rule, will that be affected? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9267.283s">So</a> if somebody had a sibling or has a sibling at one of the schools, will those people be put into the partial lottery? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9278.089s">And</a> is there like a time period? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9280.895s">somebody</a> had a sibling two to three years ago, but that sibling moved up to high school, is that still considered a sibling that went to the Andrews?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10107.692s">In</a> regards to the fairness in the way that you were talking about doing the lottery, so I kind of don't agree with doing the lottery with just the Brooke School. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10120.855s">It</a> just seems so unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10122.396s">I</a> know they didn't make that selection, but we do have school choice in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10127.977s">So</a> the families from that school sent in their selection form <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10132.698s">because</a> we had the school choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10134.399s">And</a> when we were talking about doing the lottery, we never really talked about that maybe one school would have a lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10144.904s">So</a> the way that I read this packet was it says here, all the students who have selected the Andrews, all of them, will be randomly selected to move to the McGlynn based on class size. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10159.532s">They'll</a> be put into the partial lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10162.971s">I</a> just, I don't really like the idea of doing a lottery for just one school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10168.933s">Like,</a> that just, it sounds horrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10170.454s">Like,</a> I just think it just sounds horrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10172.255s">But</a> I know they didn't make the choice, and it didn't, I know, I get it, it's just something that I'm just having a hard time with. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10179.838s">Point</a> of information, Mr. Russo.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10104.742s">On</a> Mr. Russo's? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10108.002s">In</a> regards to the fairness in the way that you were talking about doing the lottery, so I kind of don't agree with, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10117.764s">doing</a> the lottery with just the Brooke School. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10120.886s">It</a> just seems so unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10122.407s">I</a> know they didn't make that selection, but we do have school choice in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10128.012s">So</a> the families from that school sent in their selection form because we had the school choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10134.436s">And</a> when we were talking about doing the lottery, we never really talked about that maybe one school would have a lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10145.525s">Like</a> the way that I read this packet, <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10147.683s">was</a> it says here, all the students who have selected the Andrews, all of them, will be randomly selected to move to the McGlynn, you know, based on class size. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10159.553s">They'll</a> be put into the partial lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10162.115s">So</a> I just, I don't really like the idea of doing a lottery for just one school. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10168.961s">Like</a> that just, it sounds horrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10170.483s">Like</a> I just think it just sounds horrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10172.284s">But</a> I know they didn't make the choice and it didn't, <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10176.49s">I</a> know, I get it, it's just something that I'm just having a hard time with. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10179.893s">Point</a> of information, Mr. Russo.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1255.359s">Yeah,</a> mr. Okay Yep, so something that wasn't in the report and it was just brought to my attention over like the last couple of days so the <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1266.601s">The</a> Medford Vocational Principle was not included in this meeting and what I found out was and what I know is that the Medford Vocational door has a buzzer and they have a raptor system and currently the vocational door is locked which is really a disadvantage for our customers because <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1289.253s">Now</a> our customers go to the front door and they have to walk all the way over to the cosmetology and automotive and services like that where they have in their office, they have the Raptor system, they have a buzzer on the door, they have cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1305.796s">So</a> I wanna make sure and update this report, the vocational school, their door should be operational and the buzzer should, they should have somebody, a security monitor, <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1317.114s">because</a> we have these vocational services and programs for our customers in the community to come and use, including the new Bistro that's going to be coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1326.282s">So</a> we need to have a security monitor on that side. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1332.708s">On</a> the vocational door, there should be a security monitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1336.371s">That's</a> completely opposite. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1338.413s">So</a> let me answer that.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1411.827s">I'll</a> second it.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1425.338s">Can</a> I just? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1425.838s">We</a> had the vocational side had a security monitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1431.89s">up</a> until the point where the security.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1436.272s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1464.149s">So</a> now what are they asking the customers to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1466.271s">They</a> have to go to the front door of Medford High School, and some of these are elderly people, and they have to go up the stairs, walk through the hallways. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1475.58s">They</a> don't know where they're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1478.843s">It's</a> quite a distance, and I just think that it's a disadvantage to our community if we're not going to have security, where we're going to have the bistro open to customers, but we're not going to have any security.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1502.537s">I'm</a> actually asking maybe for another person like a security monitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1506.318s">They</a> used to have a security monitor who would let, who would be in the hallways and, you know, they would get buzzed in and they would go through, I think, you know, she might have run them through the Raptor system, I'm not quite sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1520.283s">But</a> they have the Raptor system. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1522.265s">They</a> have the monitors, but there's nobody there. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1525.648s">And</a> they have a sign on the door that says that you must go. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1528.691s">So</a> somebody will park.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1930.137s">Roll</a> call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1930.757s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1931.638s">Mrs.</a> DiVentino? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1932.458s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1933.078s">Mrs.</a> Kreatz? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1933.599s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1933.919s">Mrs.</a> Stone? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1934.699s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1935.219s">Mr.</a> Ruggiero? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1935.939s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1936.7s">Mr.</a> Russo? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1937.64s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1938.16s">Mrs.</a> Van De Koop? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1938.96s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1939.481s">Mayor</a> Burke? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1940.261s">Absent.</a>

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3962.009s">I</a> know where I work, and I deal with a lot of different districts, they have hotlines where if I call the main number for my district, the line will pick up, if you're calling to report bullying, please dial number two. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3975.821s">and</a> you can call directly, and you can leave a voicemail anonymously to report the bullying, and it gets documented. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3983.524s">And</a> if the person doesn't feel comfortable, it could be the parent, it could be a friend, and it can be checked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3992.267s">So</a> I think that's a good suggestion, having a separate line to our Medford Public Schools number. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3999.05s">And</a> it would just be recorded maybe by the secretaries <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4002.345s">you</a> know, hopefully there wouldn't be a lot of incidents, you know, but.<h2><a href="../2018-04-05_TayqV05M2I0/2018-04-05_TayqV05M2I0.html">Medford School Committee - Superintendent Interviews - Night 2 - 04/04/18</a></h2>

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=9023.064s">And</a> I just have one follow-up. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=9025.426s">How</a> would you allocate money to support the programs? <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=9029.21s">I</a> know a lot of the programs, some of them have a higher number of enrollment versus others. <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=9036.356s">And</a> what would you do? <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=9038.258s">Do</a> you have any experience writing grants to request money to support some of the programs?

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1304.8s">So</a> far this month, I signed up on typical invoices related to heating, electricity, pupil transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1311.506s">Also,</a> there was an invoice for an elevator repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1314.648s">Also</a> in the first week of March, I signed an invoice for prospect building services. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1320.007s">The</a> total combined of all the mini vouchers was $35,704.48. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1323.468s">And</a> what Prospect did was they performed a disinfecting mist spray at all of the schools in February. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1332.29s">The</a> cleaning also included the high school pool was cleaned, the culinary arts department machines were degreased and scrubbed, and the cosmetology was mopped, washed, buffed, and stripped, and refinished the tile floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1345.872s">I</a> thought it was interesting, so I wanted to share with everybody.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1367.72s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1368.76s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1369.021s">So</a> I have a report and so I'm the chairperson on the rules subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1376.752s">And</a> we met on February 26 in the superintendent's conference room at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1382.076s">The</a> purpose of the meeting was to review the revised proposed reporting requirements for PTO, PTG, Friends of organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1390.762s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1390.962s">Jenny</a> Graham, who's here tonight, was instrumental in helping the committee create a softer online version of the oversight guidelines for PTO, PTG, and other internal 501c3 organizations, other organizations that support our public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1406.862s">In</a> your packets, please be advised that this evening, everybody got revised copies of the guidelines and they were left on your desk this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1415.984s">So</a> if you could just be mindful of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1418.584s">There</a> was a couple of typographical errors. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1420.965s">There</a> was multiple versions of the copies and accidentally, I think, you know, the wrong one got printed in the packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1427.326s">So</a> just, you know, be on the lookout for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1430.566s">And</a> what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna read briefly the objective <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1433.973s">The</a> document is rather long, but it's very detailed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1437.834s">It's</a> excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1438.534s">If</a> anybody has any questions afterwards, I'll be happy to go over any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1442.815s">So</a> I'm going to read the objectives, and then I'm going to invite Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1445.476s">Graham</a> up to show everybody a demonstration of the online form. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1450.577s">OK,</a> so the objective of the PTO-PTG guidelines is the school committee recognizes that there are a significant number of organizations that operate within <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1462.813s">Medford</a> to augment and supplement the educational and extracurricular experiences of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1468.717s">These</a> PTO, PTG, other 501C3 organizations will be referred to as organizations throughout the document. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1476.781s">The</a> committee appreciates the hard work and the dedication of the organization of volunteers and wishes to foster an environment of collaboration and shared vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1486.747s">To</a> do that, it's important that the committee understands the number of organizations <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1491.422s">in</a> the goals of each operating to the benefit of the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1495.705s">It's</a> not the goal of the committee to centralize, stifle the efforts of the independent entities, many of which are 501c3 registered entities, but rather support their efforts through transparency and collaboration. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1509.953s">And</a> you'll notice that there's a section on organization identification, which includes the online form. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1516.617s">There's</a> a section on the bylaws, <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1520.295s">which</a> has some best practice information in it, and it's detailed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1525.579s">There's</a> information about fundraising and expenditures. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1529.282s">Training</a> is offered and available. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1531.944s">It's</a> not gonna be required, but it will be offered and strongly recommended when needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1536.387s">There's</a> also going to be an annual update, and there's compliance with the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1544.032s">So</a> at this time, I'd like to invite Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1546.373s">Jenny</a> Graham up. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1547.434s">And</a> she's been extremely instrumental. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1550.476s">And</a> she's just been a great help and amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1553.437s">And</a> she's going to demonstrate the online form. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1555.539s">And</a> you'll get to see how easy and user-friendly it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1559.161s">Thank</a> you, Jenny.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1946.237s">Very</a> smart.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2106.656s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2109.098s">It's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2109.699s">It's</a> really, it's so easy to use.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2230.507s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2245.429s">It</a> just seems like a lot of work for someone else to take on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2247.83s">It</a> is.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2328.353s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2329.854s">Kritz,</a> you wanted to make a motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2331.495s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2332.356s">There's</a> a motion on the floor to accept this policy, seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2337.82s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2338.36s">Roll</a> call vote.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4278.18s">I</a> wanted to say, I was at the open house, and it was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4281.042s">It</a> was just fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4282.323s">And</a> I loved how it was so personable with the parents and the teachers speaking and the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4287.066s">And</a> I actually learned a lot about Mr. Tucci, that he was a baseball player, and he was on the San Diego Padres. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4292.79s">I</a> was so impressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4294.612s">I</a> found that out at the open house. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4296.573s">And</a> the students did a great, great job taking people around. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4300.736s">The</a> groups were filled. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4302.717s">Going</a> up to the classrooms, the classrooms were filled. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4305.657s">The</a> teachers did a great job with the setup of the projects that were out, and just going over everything, asking questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4314.019s">It</a> was just a really, it was a very fun evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4316.98s">I</a> had a really fun time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4318.521s">And</a> I wish the McGlynn the best, you know, and all the luck.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6641.194s">What</a> about getting copies of the printed transcripts <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6645.406s">Because</a> I know if you're going to be filling out a college application or scholarship, you have to get the official transcript. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6651.468s">And</a> I was just thinking it might be helpful if somebody else in the office, besides the guidance Councilor or assigned Councilor, could print them out for the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6661.171s">But</a> it would be an authorized person. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6663.112s">Or</a> Secretary Andre. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6664.752s">Andre?</a> 
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6699.09s">And</a> then I just wanted to know, because I was reading in the report and I did get to talk to some of the guidance Councilors at the high school and I think there is actual like more like social emotional. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6711.315s">And</a> so I was thinking in terms of the budget that, you know, do we have enough Councilors at the high school? <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6718.857s">You</a> know, I'm just, I was really, you know, thinking that myself and I had it highlighted in the report because, you know, I've heard that there's more <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6726.179s">social</a> emotional is taking a lot of the time to spend with the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6731.621s">And</a> that was just my thought in thinking, do we have enough Councilors to assist all of the students?<h2><a href="../2018-03-06_Ybtx6JdbanI/2018-03-06_Ybtx6JdbanI.html">Medford School Committee Meeting March 5, 2018</a></h2>
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=732.532s">Oh,</a> miss Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=734.173s">I'm</a> confused because I signed the bills every week and I see every single invoice and I not pay payroll.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=866.942s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=867.863s">So,</a> I wanted to ask Christine a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=870.625s">So,</a> Christine, I work at the Massachusetts Retirement System, and I know that the deduction reports get transmitted monthly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=878.892s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=879.272s">So,</a> what happens is, each month, and I don't work on every public school, by the way, because it would be a conflict, but I know I work with other districts, and they report to us monthly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=888.539s">So,</a> for example, February is due in on March 10th. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=893.993s">Okay,</a> so what happens is the district has until March 10th to give us their electronic file. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=900.517s">And</a> when they import that file, the file can be exported to Excel and sorted alphabetically. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=906.82s">But</a> that's the month after the payroll's due. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=910.202s">And</a> that would be like the soonest, and that would be the most, the easiest way to do it because in myTRS you can generate that report really quickly and just cut out the social security numbers and that could be emailed to somebody, which wouldn't take time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=924.051s">It's</a> already built into the payroll software from ITRS, the reporting software, but it wouldn't be something that could be done biweekly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=934.016s">I</a> know what's involved because I work with multiple school districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=939.72s">That's</a> what I do all day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=941.28s">Mr.</a> Ruggiero?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1092.65s">Oh,</a> yes, I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1097.971s">with</a> the committee regarding the expenditure report. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1101.573s">When</a> you see the vendor name, WB Mason, the line item description only references telephones. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1107.857s">However,</a> the function code represents other expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1111.339s">A</a> review of all account structures and descriptors will take place over the summer with the finance director and city auditor to update as needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1120.465s">Going</a> forward, this won't be an issue for WB Mason when you see telephones, which you might see it <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1126.987s">Right</a> now on the report on page five of nine, you'll see telephones going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1133.369s">It</a> will show up as telephone other expenditures, but this is just one of the items that is, you know, um, one of the fixes that they're going to be doing with the descriptor updates over the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1144.091s">Um,</a> and currently the auditor and the finance director actually corrected that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1148.712s">Um,</a> so I just wanted to point that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1150.733s">And,</a> um, during the month of February I signed batches for invoices related to heating, electricity, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1156.579s">pupil</a> transportation, educational supplies, piano tuning and repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1162.303s">That</a> was something that caught my eye, Paulette and Paul, because we were at the concert and we kind of heard that the tune, the piano needed a tune up, so I wanted to mention that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1170.128s">I</a> saw the invoice and I signed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1171.809s">So,</a> yep, and many more, many, many more, so just wanted to share that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1176.838s">Okay,</a> thank you.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1981.476s">And</a> thank you, everybody else who helped out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1983.698s">We</a> really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1984.959s">Thank</a> you very much.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4912.695s">Yes,</a> I have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4914.176s">I</a> mean, I know a lot of people are talking about going <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4916.977s">electronic</a> and I think it's fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4919.699s">Is</a> there going to be a plan for the school committee members to get like tablets or iPads, you know, I mean, I have my phone, but you know, um, so that we have it to view electronically.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4942.967s">So</a> in the interim, until we have those devices, are the people who don't have the laptops going to get their paper copy?

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=341.095s">Okay,</a> so the Medford School Committee Subcommittee on the Rules was called to order by Chairperson Kathy Kreatz at 715 in the Superintendent's Conference Room at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=350.18s">Members</a> Michael Ruggiero, Paul Russo were in attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=353.663s">Attendees</a> included Superintendent Roy Belson, Deputy Superintendent Beverly Nelson. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=358.486s">Others</a> included Bob Russo, Ingrid Moncadia, Christina McGourty, Melissa Melwatt, Jenny Graham, Jane Wright, Gail Trainor, Tony Vento, Patricia Haas, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=371.273s">Robin</a> Irving, Claire Flaherty, Michelle Cicillo, Gareth McFarley, and Melanie McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=378.237s">We</a> all rose to salute the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=380.919s">Chairperson</a> stated the purpose of the meeting was twofold, review failed trip policy, review oversight guidelines for PTO, PTG, and 5013 organizations that support our public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=393.045s">Superintendent</a> Balson explained that the subcommittee's work resulted from discussions and questions raised at our regular school committee meeting on January 22nd <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=401.71s">He</a> then asked Deputy Superintendent Beverly Nelson to lead a discussion of the field trip policy and forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=407.472s">Copies</a> of the relevant forms were distributed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=410.553s">Deputy</a> Superintendent Nelson explained the need for revised policy and forms emanated from multiple discussions at the school committee meetings around key issues such as insurance, medical coverage, inclusivity, and curriculum alignment. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=425.218s">The</a> goal was to produce clear and consistent policy with streamlined forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=429.537s">The</a> policy was developed with substantial input. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=432.419s">Key</a> revisions were included. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=434.22s">Change</a> in the order of sign-off. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=436.201s">Sequence</a> of approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=438.063s">Nurse</a> to be notified when student listing is ascertained. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=441.525s">Cost</a> to be estimated until full student participation is determined. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=448.149s">Teachers</a> Robin Irving and Patty Haas spoke about their confusion as it related to the new forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=454.093s">They</a> stressed their commitment to inclusivity. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=457.394s">They</a> were concerned about the curriculum director sign off. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=460.495s">The</a> superintendent exclaimed that it was new and the department director was unsure of the approval requirement in the sequence. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=467.619s">He</a> explained that the curriculum director needed to ensure an alignment with curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=477.163s">A</a> field trip is an alternative classroom and it must be of value. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=480.825s">It</a> must be a substitute for a day of classroom instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=485.747s">After</a> alignment is determined, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=487.381s">then</a> participation listing must be checked out for appropriate supports, accommodations, consistent with student needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=494.244s">It's</a> a two-step process. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=496.285s">Health</a> Supervisor Tony Vento exclaimed that Massachusetts is not a compact state and our nurses cannot supervise out-of-state trips. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=505.248s">Also,</a> the administration of medications by persons needs physician's approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=510.691s">It</a> was explained that if there were specialized costs, it might be necessary to revise the per-pupil assessment <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=517.262s">Also,</a> if a trip was canceled for appropriate reasons, then insurance refunds should be incorporated into the planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=523.625s">Melanie</a> McLaughlin, parent of CPAC chairperson, raised various ADA issues and possible need for SPED sign-off. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=531.47s">She</a> was concerned if students were eliminated for academic reasons, also for disciplinary reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=537.413s">It</a> was explained that special ed students were in attendance, then special ed teachers and staff would be on the trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=544.817s">Also,</a> the school had the right to exclude <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=547.071s">participation</a> for valid academic and disciplinary reasons, as long as they were legitimate, non-discriminating reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=554.436s">Student</a> participation was shared, responsibility between home and school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=559.1s">Member</a> Ruggiero suggested that the ADA comment be added to the form. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=563.303s">As</a> a result of the discussions, will be made to the forms in the following, ADA reference checklist, change in the order of the sign-off, nurse notification rather than approval, estimated costs rather than actual <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=577.044s">process</a> will be better explained. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=579.245s">The</a> subcommittee then began the discussion of oversight regulations proposal by the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=584.847s">Member</a> Ruseau felt that October 1 would be better than September 1st for submission of the materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=591.209s">There</a> were pros and cons to the date changes, but it was not decided. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=595.811s">The</a> discussion centered primarily on the tone of the regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=599.392s">Most</a> were concerned that they sounded too negative and heavy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=603.114s">Also,</a> there was a good give and take on why they were needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=606.336s">The</a> superintendent felt that greater coordination would not impinge on the autonomy of various groups, but could lead to greater resources and better coordination with the school budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=616.602s">There</a> was concern about economic equality among the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=620.224s">Jen</a> Graham volunteered to rework the regulations into a more friendly listing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=625.067s">The</a> subcommittee agreed to hold any vote in absence until the new language could be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=631.511s">On</a> the motion, Mr. Russo seconded by Mr. Ruggiero, the meeting was adjourned at 9.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=636.96s">So</a> I will follow up with Superintendent Belson, and when we have the revisions, I could call another subcommittee meeting as a follow-up.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=670.347s">That's</a> my feeling. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=671.688s">I</a> think that would be my understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=674.569s">So</a> if you look at the back of our packets, Erin, there is a, at the very back, there's a recommendation to the approval of the field trip policy and there's a checklist. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=686.134s">So</a> what the, you know, what the teachers will do is they'll follow the checklist and they'll have their forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=694.281s">and</a> they can bring them, you know, working with the checklist to the appropriate person. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=700.483s">And</a> so at the bottom, it's, there's been a revision where the signature will be, the order of the signature is the principal or assistant principal in the curricular curriculum and the notification to the nurse. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=716.808s">So</a> there's not, at the very bottom, there's only approval for <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=721.471s">you</a> know, the principal and the curriculum director, and then notification going to the nurse. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=727.955s">You</a> know, there is different forms for the day trip and for the overnight trip, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=737.4s">Okay,</a> Beverly, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=739.261s">Nelson?</a>

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=233.394s">I</a> can answer that one.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=460.032s">Kreatz</a> sees that with the bill signing. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=461.773s">Yeah,</a> so when you get the bill, it's this big batch. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=465.515s">And</a> every single receipt is behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=468.357s">So</a> the total amount will be $11,904. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=470.158s">And</a> then there'll be line items and receipts to match every single item. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=478.002s">And</a> I'd be happy to show you if you want to come down one day on Wednesday, then you can sit next to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=483.846s">It</a> takes about three hours, and we can go do it.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=489.29s">And</a> then it would be nice to have another person trained, because it is something you have to do every week in case I couldn't make it for some reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=497.375s">It</a> does have to be done by Wednesday, because then they have to run the warrants, and then they call Joe and invite him. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=504.079s">So</a> yeah, so anytime, just text me and you can come and see. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=508.803s">It's</a> really interesting because even glue that's 98 cents, there'll be a receipt for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=514.988s">Honestly,</a> 25 cents, I've seen receipts. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=517.91s">Yeah,</a> it's been very, very interesting.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2822.326s">Yeah,</a> that was my suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2824.607s">If</a> the lecture halls were not heated, maybe have them go to the cafeteria.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6346.004s">Yes,</a> seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6389.511s">Yes,</a> I'm in the affirmative.<h2><a href="../2017-12-18_rpuG18WtRwY/2017-12-18_rpuG18WtRwY.html">Medford, MA School Committee - Dec. 18, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=513.025s">I</a> just wanted to know, in regards to the field trip policy, if the teachers and all the other administrators are aware of the school policies, what they need to follow before they make their field trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=527.354s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=529.816s">Nelson,</a> could you help answer that question? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=533.538s">I</a> just had a couple of questions from a teacher, and I just wasn't sure if everybody's aware to follow these policies.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7123.055s">Kreatz,</a> waiting patiently. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7126.898s">Thank</a> you for the updated report, Dr. Brower. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7130.02s">I</a> also spoke to a couple of parents, and they mentioned to me that over the last week or so, there's been a lot of pushing and shoving every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7141.007s">And</a> I'm just not sure, did you interview any of the students to find out why that's happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7145.869s">Is</a> it because? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7146.589s">It</a> just seems like it's because it's overcrowded. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7149.83s">But</a> I know that particular day, it wasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7152.451s">And</a> some of the parents I spoke to said that one parent said that their student was waiting in line, but it was so crowded that their student went off to call for a ride from a parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7164.614s">It</a> seems like maybe it starts out crowded and maybe it doesn't end as crowded. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7169.9s">But</a> I think what I've heard is that students are sitting on the ground in the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7176.106s">That's</a> what I've heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7178.088s">And</a> I've also heard that the bus passes aren't being checked for ridership. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7183.853s">And</a> that there's just, for some reason, recently, pushing and shoving going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7188.796s">So</a> I don't know why, if it's not overcrowded, why are shooting, you know, pushing and shoving to get on the bus?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7354.561s">Are</a> you all set? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7355.381s">Yep,</a> I think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7356.021s">I</a> just wanted to make sure, so are the student IDs going to be monitored to make sure that the students that are going on the bus are the students that are eligible to go on the Fulton Heights bus? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7367.904s">I'm</a> not sure, like it does say that there will be administrators out there reviewing student usage of the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7373.665s">Are</a> they going to be checking them as they go on?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7434.641s">And</a> there was just one other concern was what I also heard was that the students were walking in the street along with the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7444.186s">So</a> is there anybody going to be right out there making sure that students aren't doing that for any of the buses?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8194.32s">So</a> Dr. Perrella, over the weekend between Friday and Sunday, the Medford High School Medford Vocational Facebook page, parents were writing just nonstop about the vaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8206.446s">And</a> they want to know who's monitoring the hallways and outside the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8212.55s">And</a> I guess, like you said, it's in plain sight. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8215.211s">So</a> a student could walk by you, and then they're vaping just as they walk by you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8220.214s">And</a> I've been told that this is happening, and that people, you know, students are doing, you know, vaping in the bathroom, in the classroom, like Aaron described once before, where they're puffing it right into their sweatshirt, and it's, they're just, it's done in plain sight, almost like right in the classroom, and it's really concerning to a lot of parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8241.562s">It</a> just seems like, because they're such small devices, very hard to detect, and it's odorless. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8249.465s">I</a> mentioned to the parents that we had the discussion with Team Medford, and that Penny was here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8254.907s">And</a> I added the YouTube video and told them exactly what sections that were discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8259.829s">And</a> I encouraged them to go to the seminar. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8264.851s">And</a> they'd also like to know, when is the student assembly? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8269.015s">That</a> was their big question. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8270.116s">What</a> did they hear from their children about the student assembly? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8272.758s">But</a> I don't think it happened yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8275.341s">Or</a> did it happen?

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7132.123s">Kreatz,</a> she's been waiting patiently. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7135.967s">Thank</a> you for the updated report, Dr. Brewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7139.09s">I</a> also spoke to a couple of parents and they mentioned to me that <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7143.309s">you</a> know, that over the last week or so, it's been, there's been a lot of pushing and shoving every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7150.072s">And,</a> you know, I'm just not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7151.213s">Did</a> you, um, interview any of the students to find out why that's happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7154.934s">Is</a> it because like, it just seems like it's because it's overcrowded, but I know that particular day it wasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7161.497s">And</a> some of the parents I spoke to said that one parent said that their student was waiting in line, but it was so crowded that their student like went off to call for a ride from a parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7172.282s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7173.333s">Like</a> it seems like maybe it starts out crowded and maybe it doesn't end as crowded. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7178.917s">But</a> I think what I've heard is that students are sitting on the ground in the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7185.121s">That's</a> what I've heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7187.102s">And</a> I've also heard that the bus passes aren't being checked for ridership. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7192.874s">And</a> that there's just, for some reason, recently, pushing and shoving going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7197.817s">So</a> I don't know why, if it's not overcrowded, why are shooting, you know, pushing and shoving to get on the bus?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7363.623s">Are</a> you all set? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7364.424s">Yep,</a> I think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7365.064s">I</a> just wanted to make sure, so are the student IDs going to be monitored to make sure that the students that are going on the bus are the students that are eligible to go on the Fulton Heights bus? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7376.954s">I'm</a> not sure, like it does say that there will be administrators out there reviewing student usage of the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7382.698s">Are</a> they going to be checking them as they go on?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7443.67s">And</a> there was just one other concern was what I also heard was that the students were walking in the street along with the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7453.239s">So</a> is there anybody going to be right out there making sure that students aren't doing that for any of the buses? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7458.824s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8201.687s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8203.328s">So</a> Dr. Perrella, over the weekend, between Friday and Sunday, the Medford High School Medford Vocational Facebook page, parents were writing just nonstop about the vaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8215.432s">And</a> they want to know who's monitoring the hallways and outside the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8221.574s">And</a> I guess, like you said, it's in plain sight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8224.868s">a</a> student could walk by you, and then they're vaping just as they walk by you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8229.25s">And</a> I've been told that this is happening, and that people, you know, students are doing, you know, vaping in the bathroom, in the classroom, like Aaron described once before, where they're puffing it right into their sweatshirt, and it's, they're just, it's done in plain sight, almost like right in the classroom, and it's really concerning to a lot of parents, but it just seems like, because they're such small devices, <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8254.534s">very</a> hard to detect, and it's odorless. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8258.516s">I</a> mentioned to the parents that we had the discussion with Team Medford, and that Penny was here, and I added the YouTube video and told them exactly what sections that were discussed, and I encouraged them to go to the seminar. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8273.882s">And</a> they'd also like to know, when is the student assembly? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8278.063s">That</a> was their big question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8279.144s">What</a> did they hear from their children about the student assembly? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8282.408s">I</a> don't think it happened yet, or did it happen?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8367.762s">I</a> do have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8368.963s">Is</a> it a particular bathroom or area? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8372.126s">And</a> could we have Officer Riccardi monitor that area? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8377.311s">If</a> there's a certain bathroom that this is really happening in? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8381.455s">I</a> also read a comment that one parent said that their child was offered <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8388.701s">to</a> purchase marijuana outside the bathroom or in the hallway. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8394.025s">So</a> I just don't know if we need to have maybe Officer Riccardi kind of rotate around. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8399.749s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8400.79s">I</a> just wanted to bring it to your attention.

re-election for Medford School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4148.682s">I</a> just want to simply say thank you to Henley Miller and the Democratic Ward Committee for having this candidate night. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4157.444s">So</a> I'm running for re-election for Medford School Committee, and I'm a Medford High School graduate. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4162.405s">I</a> grew up in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4164.105s">My</a> parents moved here when I was four months old. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4166.706s">I</a> went to the Waite School, which was the neighborhood school. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4170.147s">I</a> went to the Hobbs Junior High. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4171.881s">I</a> went to Medford High School and I graduated class of 1990. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4175.663s">My</a> husband graduated Medford Vocational one year before me and my son, like his dad, is enrolled in the Medford Vocational High School and he's enrolled in the robotics engineering program. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4187.108s">Immediately</a> after graduating high school, I went to college and I went to Suffolk University. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4192.071s">I</a> commuted and I worked two jobs while going to college so that I could maintain work and school and paying some of my education. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4201.637s">After</a> I graduated college, I immediately began working at State Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4205.198s">I</a> worked there for 13 years, and then shortly after my son, who I adopted, came over here from Korea, I wanted to work from home, so I established my own licensed family daycare business, so I could stay home and take care of him. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4219.184s">When</a> he went to kindergarten, I started working at Mass Teachers Retirement System. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4224.286s">So</a> shortly after my son moved on from middle school to high school, <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4228.547s">I</a> missed the interactions at the elementary school and the middle school levels, and I was interested in running for school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4234.112s">So</a> I ran the first time, and here I am running again. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4237.374s">And</a> some of the accomplishments that I have to talk about while I was on school committee in my first term were, I set out that for my plan was that I was going to go out to each and every school, meet with the principals, do a site tour, and do classroom observations. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4253.048s">And</a> I did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4253.908s">I</a> accomplished that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4255.223s">and</a> I have some great stories to share about going to the classroom observations. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4259.484s">I</a> went out to each elementary school, and I went to the Roberts Elementary, and I sat through a little observation in the kindergarten where the students were doing K-Focus, and the little group I was put with was doing acting out dramatic play, The Three Little Pigs, and they were cutting out with construction paper, and they were kind of acting out The Three Little Pigs. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4283.991s">It</a> was just amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4285.325s">I've</a> been to the Columbus Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4287.667s">The</a> children were writing out commercials. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4289.768s">Later</a> that year, I was invited back to go see the commercials acted out, and they walked down the red carpet. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4296.253s">I've</a> been to the Brooks Elementary, where the students were dressed up to portray somebody in history, and they recited who they were representing. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4304.678s">I've</a> been to the McGlynn Elementary to see their hydroponics project, and the day I went, the lettuce that they were growing was ready to be cut, <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4313.068s">So</a> we had a taste testing, and the students brought in some of their salad dressings. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4317.211s">So</a> one of my things that I've been doing is just going out to the schools and being there and seeing what the students are doing, working with the teachers and the administrators. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4326.178s">And</a> I want to continue doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4328.08s">I've</a> been on field trips with the middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4330.942s">We</a> went to the Museum of Science. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4334.064s">I've</a> been on a field trip with the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4335.986s">We</a> went to the Day at the Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4337.867s">I</a> want to continue to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4340.84s">I've</a> been a very big advocate for the Medford Vocational Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4344.984s">We</a> have 20 programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4346.786s">We've</a> reduced our students going to Minuteman, so we're saving money. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4350.831s">We</a> have a partnership with Everett, and we have tuition coming in from Everett. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4355.496s">Students</a> are taking courses at the Medford Vocational School. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4358.659s">I'm</a> on the Robotics Engineering Advisory Committee, and I'm just so very proud of <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4364.176s">all</a> of the equipment that we have in our robotics shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4366.658s">We</a> started out with just 3D printers. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4369.18s">We</a> have a CNC, we have a mill, a lathe, we have a water jet, we have equipment that's industry ready that compares to some of our local colleges that I've seen when I've gone on college tours. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4384.37s">It's</a> just incredible what our students know and what they're learning right now, hands on. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4390.614s">They're</a> going on co-ops. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4392.235s">at</a> companies and they're earning above $6 above minimum wage right now while they're in high school seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4400.14s">It's</a> incredible. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4400.981s">I</a> am so proud of our Medford Vocational and Medford High School and I'm happy to say that right now all of our students graduate from Medford High School, Medford Folk are now under one. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4413.463s">And</a> they can now access post-secondary education. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4416.945s">They</a> can go to college. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4418.366s">They</a> can go to career. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4420.047s">They</a> can go in the union. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4421.928s">That</a> option is there for all of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4424.209s">And</a> we made that possible with the merger that just happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4428.551s">There's</a> still a lot to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4430.475s">and</a> I look forward to the next couple of years, so I appreciate your vote for another term on the Medford School Committee. <a

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=429.32s">I</a> have some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=430.221s">We'd</a> like it read, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=431.322s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=431.482s">Fritz</a> has some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=434.924s">Superintendent,</a> I was a little confused about the motion, so I had sent some inquiries over to Dr. Perala and the director of guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=457.108s">But</a> what I found out through email communication was that's something that's not possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=462.893s">You</a> know, currently there isn't a way in Naviance to add a notation on the transcript <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=469.099s">or</a> add an additional document, or attach a separate page. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=473.723s">So</a> what they can do is the guidance Councilor can write a letter of recommendation on behalf of the student, providing the information about the class rank, what the student was prior to the merger, and the student can complete a brag sheet, and that can help the guidance Councilor write the personal accomplishments about the student. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=495.24s">but</a> you know this is all through communications so I was wondering if you know we can I'd like to make a motion you know to invite the headmaster and the vocational director back so we can get like the final details about the class ranking because this was just me going back and forth because I was a little confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=514.387s">I</a> thought it was gonna be something different than what we motioned for.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=726.528s">I</a> know it's not an emergency matter, but I just thought it would be a nice report if we could get a report on the breakdown of how many students are in each co-op shop and where they're working. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=739.074s">It</a> was just something really interesting, but it's not an emergency report. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=743.376s">So</a> I'd like to make a motion for that.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=767.902s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=773.329s">And</a> I just had one more. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=774.549s">I</a> wanted to inquire about one shop in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=779.852s">It</a> was the robotics engineering. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=781.753s">Originally,</a> the robotics engineering has been the traditional vocational program, and it's going to be switching over with the graduating class of 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=791.218s">And</a> just recently, there's been a development where there is <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=798.462s">there</a> is a co-op opportunity for the robotics engineering students so I just wanted to bring that up and if it could be revisited for the future students if they were interested in the co-op plan it would be ideal and I was out this weekend <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=815.774s">going</a> out doing the college tours and what we saw was at Wentworth they had the same equipment that we have in our robotics engineering shop and my son, he's been involved in the program, he knew all the names of the machines and in fact we have newer machines than they have <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=834.321s">You</a> know, they have like a five-axis and we have a three-axis, but he knew all the machines and they had the sheet metal shop, and it was just really fascinating to see that our Medford Vocational School has that equipment that's college-ready, and when they shared some information about their co-ops, their students are college students going out and getting co-ops, and they're starting out at $15 an hour, and that's what our vocational students are doing, <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=859.267s">in</a> that particular field, so I really think it's important to have another look at the robotics engineering program because there might be an opportunity for it to remain as the A week B week program and this was a new development that came about recently for an opportunity for students. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=878.672s">I</a> would like to make a motion to have that revisited.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2142.746s">I</a> want to thank you all for coming out tonight, and it was just such great spirit It was great hearing from all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2149.811s">It</a> was just wonderful, and you know what great work You're doing at the school, and you know it's coming from my other colleagues is that we were just you know talking about the different the clubs and the students want to go to one school and and <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2162.381s">You</a> know, we're trying to find an equal balance, but we are very grateful to all the hard work that you do every day at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2169.825s">I've</a> been out to the McGlynn when I went first term, and I had the best experience in the fourth grade class going to see the hydroponics project. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2180.51s">I</a> helped organize a field trip between the McGlynn and the vocational school and it was just fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2185.576s">I</a> had the most fun and been to the concerts and everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2189.481s">I</a> just love it there and it's just a great school and thank you all for what you do every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2194.026s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6535.84s">I</a> have training at my work, and then I'm on the advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6538.622s">So</a> I can't go that week either.<h2><a href="../2017-09-13_DeDxs5cAHuk/2017-09-13_DeDxs5cAHuk.html">School Committee meeting September 11, 2017</a></h2>
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=168.284s">Is</a> there a motion approval? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=169.084s">I</a> have a question, Mayor Byron. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=170.565s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=170.765s">Kritz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=172.386s">I</a> wanted to know, I recall at the last meeting, the budget meeting, the library was going to have extended hours at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=180.75s">I</a> didn't know if they had an update on what time the library was going to open and the time it was going to close this fall season. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=189.374s">Superintendent?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=191.495s">Update</a> on library hours.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=203.505s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=204.805s">And</a> I had one other item from, it would be considered, I think, old business. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=210.267s">And,</a> you know, I just wanted to bring this up as a matter of concern related to the old business regarding the merger of the high school and the vocational technical high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=219.989s">It's</a> concerning to me, some of the students and the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=224.43s">I</a> recall from the past discussion in the committee packets that it was very clearly expressed that the vocational <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=230.731s">high</a> school was going to maintain its own identity. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=234.053s">However,</a> it doesn't seem like that's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=238.016s">Over</a> the first few weeks of school, I've seen some of the recent changes implemented, and they don't identify the vocational high school from the high school counterparts. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=247.902s">The</a> two high schools were merged together, and they're no longer unique. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=251.844s">The</a> vocational programs are made to distinguish the vocational from the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=256.227s">I</a> realize the merger was beneficial to our school system for the financial reasons, <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=260.827s">However,</a> the vocational school has lost their identity. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=264.449s">I've</a> heard from discouraged students, parents, you know, they're asking me why the vocational school has been written off, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=272.692s">You</a> know, I'm upset, my family is upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=276.634s">For</a> example, here's some examples that recently, you know, I found out, you know, currently, and we found out during the parent evening session that there is no longer a vocational <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=288.903s">assistant</a> principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=290.063s">It's</a> all through the high school, which is a big adjustment for the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=294.144s">The</a> guidance council was moved over to the high school office, which is also really difficult for the students to get to and to access their guidance Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=304.046s">You</a> know, my son himself has been going back and forth, back and forth, multiple trips, trying to see if the guidance Councilor is in the office. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=311.007s">It's</a> about a five minute walk to and from <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=313.808s">to</a> get back to class. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=316.19s">That's</a> just an inconvenience, and I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=318.352s">And</a> maybe the students need to make appointments. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=320.033s">However,</a> the students are confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=322.816s">I'm</a> confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=323.697s">Parents</a> are confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=325.565s">Some</a> of the students don't realize that even though it was explained in the student assembly, their assistant principal is at the high school, they don't really think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=336.777s">They</a> don't believe it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=338.239s">They</a> want to be part of the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=341.782s">And</a> then some other things that developed that I found out over the last couple of days is that <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=348.455s">The</a> vocational school won't have a class president or vice president. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=352.177s">This</a> is very upsetting. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=353.577s">They</a> will only have a med vocational representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=357.239s">It's</a> just very upsetting. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=358.56s">There</a> was a vice president last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=360.18s">There</a> was assistant president. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=361.761s">There</a> was a valedictorian. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=363.462s">That's</a> all been taken away. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=365.102s">Who</a> will represent the ideas and the needs of the vocational students? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=368.444s">It's</a> difficult for one vocational student to relate all the students' needs and concerns to the high school representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=375.287s">I</a> realize it's going to be one school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=377.948s">but</a> the programs operate very differently, and there needs to be representation from the vocational shop students. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=384.35s">A</a> high school student's perspective cannot reflect the vocational student's needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=389.351s">They're</a> really different. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=390.491s">Their</a> days are structured differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=392.252s">Like</a> my son has one week of shop, one week of academics. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=396.273s">During</a> his week of academics, he has double blocks of academics, two blocks of math, two blocks of English. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=403.594s">He's</a> behind on the testing schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=406.655s">Their</a> timelines are very different. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=409.297s">Another</a> thing I learned today while I was reaching out to get a copy of my son's transcript, and I received a letter along with a copy of my transcript that explained to me that from this point on, they are now under the high school number. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=426.185s">Last</a> year, he had his own number, and it's on the enrollment package in this year's enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=431.848s">There</a> was 56 students in the class. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=434.27s">However,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=435.82s">For</a> the transcript, it's now going to be grouped together, which changes the class ranking, and it's really upsetting to the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=444.908s">They</a> didn't know this was happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=446.55s">I</a> didn't know this was happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=447.731s">I</a> found this out today. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=450.634s">I</a> was upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=451.895s">I</a> know it doesn't matter to me what your class ranking is. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=455.078s">I</a> say do the best you can. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=456.419s">You've</a> got good grades. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=458.241s">I'm</a> not all about that, but it was so upsetting that we didn't know this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=464.305s">I</a> went to the parent evening night last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=466.907s">This</a> wasn't brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=468.068s">None</a> of these issues were brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=469.91s">All</a> of this information is getting trickled down, and the students are finding it out, and they're telling me. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=476.715s">And</a> then here's another issue, is that the SkillsUSA program, that's exclusively for vocational students. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=483.741s">are</a> we going to dissolve the SkillsUSA? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=485.602s">Because</a> that's for the shop students. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=488.104s">So</a> what I wanted to do was make a motion or a resolution to request a full report for our next meeting so we can discuss the updates and ask what the community thinks about all these updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=499.812s">And</a> maybe invite some of the vocational students and maybe some representatives from the site council of the high school and some of the administrators from the site council to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=509.319s">and</a> talk about these updates because I think when we moved to make it one school, I clearly remember in every discussion it was told that the vocational school will have its own identity. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=523.64s">I</a> mean, I remember it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=525.122s">So</a> well, I just that's all I remember I say that we sure are you sure and that's what my concern was Because I represent the vocational students. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=533.468s">I'm</a> there. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=534.409s">I</a> popped in, you know, just last week to check with everybody Everything's going well with the new vice-principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=540.053s">I</a> think it's the students are confused This is a really big adjustment and it's just when we went from last year June and <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=547.999s">You're</a> a vocational student. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=549.08s">This</a> year, my son is going to graduate with a high school degree. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=552.601s">He</a> loves and he's proud to be a vocational student. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=555.863s">He's</a> shocked. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=557.004s">He</a> is just shocked and upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=558.444s">And</a> I wanted him to come tonight, but he didn't want to. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=561.886s">He's</a> actually really busy, and he didn't want to come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=565.988s">But</a> I'm just speaking on his behalf for his friends, and it's upsetting. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=571.091s">I</a> don't want to go on and on much more, but I just had to. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=574.192s">I've</a> been frustrated, and I've been emailing people. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=577.374s">I</a> just had to mention my concerns.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=849.651s">We</a> found out a letter was mailed home to the families. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=852.954s">And</a> even when I got the letter and it said that there's going to be a parent evening night for the high school and vocational families, I didn't know that letter meant that my son now has a different assistant. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=867.564s">I</a> had no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=868.905s">In</a> fact, I called my colleague Paulette to say, Paulette, did you know about this? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=873.305s">because</a> I was so baffled. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=874.747s">My</a> sister was confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=876.248s">I</a> was getting calls from parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=877.67s">What</a> does this mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=878.892s">What</a> happened to the vocational school? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=880.513s">I</a> said, I don't know anything about this.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3241.28s">So</a> what I was confused about, because all the discussion I was hearing that the two schools were getting combined, and I wasn't sure why the numbers were separated for the high school and the vocational for grades 11 and 12, but not the freshman and sophomore classes.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4098.582s">I</a> have one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4100.463s">I</a> got to stop by the Bistro last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4103.054s">and</a> it's coming along. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4103.855s">It</a> looks really great. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4104.736s">The</a> furniture was delivered. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4105.917s">It's</a> all, it was all packaged, so they hadn't opened it yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4108.499s">And</a> I got to talk to some of the students and they're all, they're so very proud that they're helping, you know, build the bistro. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4114.784s">And,</a> um, I just wanted to know, um, was there like a plan for an opening date or, um, what's the timeline for completion? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4122.871s">It</a> looked really close to almost being done.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4205.117s">I</a> saw her, she was here last week.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4485.414s">I</a> had some questions in notes.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4576.445s">Oh,</a> hi. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4577.466s">Thank</a> you, Christine and Superintendent Belzin for getting back to me with all my questions that I had about the bus the first week of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4584.974s">I</a> was really happy to read in this report that next year a yellow bus will be provided Information will be communicated for the first week for all of the people traveling to the high school There was a lot of parents that were concerned and there was a lot of information on Facebook You know what's going on with the bus and a lot of things going back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4605.87s">Thank</a> you for all the communication and putting together the <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4610.031s">part</a> of the robocall. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4612.754s">I</a> did hear from some people after the robocall with some concerns because <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4619.556s">Part</a> of the message that we relayed in an email communication wasn't included in the robocall, which caused a little confusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4627.659s">So</a> some people didn't realize there was going to be a yellow bus traveling down Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4633.681s">I</a> think I communicated, Christine, and you mentioned that when the bus did arrive at the high school, it was nearly full. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4640.644s">And</a> I wanted to share that information with the public because I was going back with a lot of parents because they wanted to know where I got that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4648.149s">You</a> know, where was that coming from? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4650.29s">So</a> there was a lot of confusion that first week. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4652.371s">I'm</a> glad it's all rectified and thank you for handling it so well. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4658.595s">I</a> did want to know something that came out from the discussions was <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4663.858s">you</a> know, why did we pick that particular route for the yellow bus? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4668.9s">Like,</a> why wasn't it other communities like South Medford, West Medford, East Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4674.982s">You</a> know, I didn't have an answer for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4677.142s">So,</a> you know, I just, I was kind of waiting for a report on the yellow bus itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4682.604s">I</a> know that's something new that hasn't been done before. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4686.986s">Do</a> you know why that particular route was used?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4695.755s">That</a> was related to the yellow bus, you know, why the route was utilized on that particular day, you know, to just travel through, like, Salem Street and then go, you know, through, you know, Winthrop and then up to the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4710.105s">Sure.</a> 
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4914.965s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4915.145s">Cuno?</a> 
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4917.987s">I</a> just had just a couple of follow-up questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4920.648s">So</a> if a parent didn't get the robocall, who can they contact to get added to the call list? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4927.011s">Because</a> that was also another concern that a lot of people said, I didn't get the robocall. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4931.534s">So</a> I videoed the robocall and I put it on YouTube and then uploaded it to share it on Facebook so that they could hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4940.258s">But</a> I don't know why they didn't get it.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4973.897s">Yes,</a> is it the student's homeroom teacher? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4979.2s">What</a> form would it be? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4980.3s">Who</a> would they actually reach out to?
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5017.515s">And</a> this is unrelated to the yellow bus, <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5020.987s">So</a> I also had some inquiries from students and parents who ride the Fulton Heights bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5026.853s">And</a> in the morning, there's been a lot of overcrowding. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5030.096s">And</a> I know I was told that last year there were two morning buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5034.28s">There</a> was an early morning bus at like 6.50, and then there was a later morning bus, not too sure what the time was. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5041.567s">But</a> I looked in the information you provided, and it looks like there are two buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5047.027s">But</a> it looks like they're both at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5049.73s">So</a> I don't know if maybe is that, I did note in here that there were two buses, Fulton Heights buses.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5074.383s">So</a> they do like, so one would come and another one comes right along and both kind of departed at 6 50. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5078.806s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5082.389s">And</a> one last suggestion I heard was, can we put <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5087.107s">the</a> MBTA bus stops on our website, almost similar to what we have here, but the actual MBTA bus stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5096.535s">So</a> everything's centrally located on the one page or the one website. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5102.12s">It</a> was a suggestion that came to me.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5127.455s">That</a> would be nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5128.316s">If</a> there was a direct link, they could click on the link, and then they could navigate around from there, if that's possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5133.682s">I</a> mean, you probably have to check on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5136.124s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5136.384s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5137.205s">Ms.</a> 
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5254.574s">You</a> have the idea to go into school brains now? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5256.955s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5305.018s">Is</a> that the initial question? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5305.939s">Because</a> I would assume that you had numbers in the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5309.061s">I</a> can't hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5309.942s">Dr.</a> Perlow, I didn't even hear what you said. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5311.923s">I'm</a> sure it's very weird. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5313.344s">Someone</a> didn't get a robocall.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5316.787s">Yes,</a> I have access to School Brains. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5319.429s">I</a> got the robocall, but I went into School Brains last night just to navigate around again in preparation for this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5330.147s">I</a> don't recall there's an area in School Brains that I can add my contact information. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5335.908s">I'm</a> given a username and password.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9914.245s">Great,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9915.006s">I</a> have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9916.747s">Hi,</a> Curtis. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9918.388s">I</a> have a question, and this happened a few times last year, where what we experienced was a couple of different times, like each progress report and each report card, it wasn't the grade point average. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9933.48s">It</a> was the grade that was completely wrong, and it was completely wrong on school brains. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9939.525s">And</a> I'm not sure if it was because maybe somebody wasn't entering the grade or they needed some more training on how to use the school brains tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9949.911s">But</a> when this occurred last year, it caused great stress and anxiety on the student, the family, and going back and forth between the administration and the teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9964.54s">The</a> student would get the report card or the progress report and the teacher was already gone for the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9970.265s">And</a> the actual grade on the report card and progress report was wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9976.39s">And</a> it even had wrong comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9978.732s">So</a> this happened to my own son. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9982.295s">and</a> some friends of his. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9983.696s">And</a> it was really concerning. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9986.479s">And</a> it was just really, really upsetting. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9989.661s">And</a> it caused great stress and anxiety on the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9992.944s">I</a> mean, these students were B plus students. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9995.846s">And</a> their grade showed as a failing grade on school brains and progress report because the grades were not entered. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10003.673s">So</a> I just want to make sure that there's precautions in place for this first term because <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10011.999s">It</a> didn't happen consistently with one particular class. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10016.16s">It</a> was just, you know, randomly this one, another one, and, you know, it was, you know, it wasn't reliable. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10023.282s">So,</a> you know, you never knew if it was going to be accurate, and we had to back up our grades on paper and notebooks, and that was more reliable than <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10031.264s">the</a> school brains. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10032.505s">We</a> kept track of every single grade and it was just a lot of record keeping that you have to do on your own. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10038.491s">So</a> I didn't know if you have any plans in place for this first quarter coming up.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10115.987s">And</a> I know when it did happen, you were extremely helpful, and so was the assistant principal in issuing revised progress reports and report cards. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10126.243s">In</a> fact, within the next day. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10128.346s">So</a> I really appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10131.17s">I</a> just wanted to make sure it was on the radar.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10134.771s">Because</a> it's on my radar.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10158.739s">I</a> just have one more. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10161.561s">And</a> Curtis, I wanted to know if you could put something on the website or in the instruction booklet, because what I ran into last year was that there were block out dates where you can't access your grades. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10172.71s">And,</a> and I had asked you, you know, why can't we see the grades? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10176.353s">And</a> you can't quite remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10178.235s">I</a> think it had something to do with contractual. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10179.956s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10180.656s">But</a> I'm, don't recall.<h2><a href="../2017-05-16_w0sagWRQcPk/2017-05-16_w0sagWRQcPk.html">Medford, MA School Committee - May 15, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=699.178s">The</a> intercom in the school wasn't working properly.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=765.628s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=765.868s">Kreatz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=766.269s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=767.629s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=768.229s">Um,</a> yep. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=768.729s">So</a> I got another update this, this actually this morning, late this morning, um, regarding the crossing light at Fulton street and the Fellsway. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=779.571s">And,</a> um, I have the update. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=781.071s">I'm</a> going to read it to you right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=782.752s">So</a> the Fulton street crossing time has been changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=785.588s">It's</a> been changed for about two weeks now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=788.81s">So</a> the walk sign will go for up to 24 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=793.092s">Then</a> it will flash walk for 13 seconds, and it will count down, and you have exactly 13 seconds to finish walking across. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=803.218s">With</a> the three second do not walk, so that the lights will then signal to change, and then the cars will begin going. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=811.423s">The</a> traffic engineer department is also looking into adding a second crossing <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=815.74s">in</a> the intersection on the other side would likely make the intersection safer and work more smoothly as it would require less pushing of the pedestrian walk buttons to get from one side of the Fulton to the diagonal side across. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=829.431s">However,</a> it's likely that this will need to be reexamined in the spring due to the weather conditions that are coming with the winter coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=837.077s">And</a> it's difficult to paint lines and do any repaving in the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=841.461s">So</a> it's something that they're going to revisit again in the February. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=844.97s">I</a> did test out the crossing light today with Noah three times, and you have 36 seconds, and you can get across all lanes, and you don't have to run. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=855.616s">You</a> can simply walk across all lanes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=858.638s">The</a> traffic is stopped everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=860.139s">It's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=860.739s">It's</a> amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=861.62s">It</a> was really impressive, so I wanted to share that update with everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=866.043s">Very</a> good, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=866.663s">Kreatz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=866.943s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=867.503s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=169.055s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=169.595s">Could</a> I just ask one question? <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=171.296s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=172.256s">I</a> almost missed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=173.517s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=174.677s">Oh,</a> Pat, I wanted to thank you for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=176.505s">And</a> I just wanted to ask just a couple questions for the upcoming school year, you know, in terms of the transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=183.028s">Um,</a> I know last year, um, there was a plan failed trip between, um, the elementary school and the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=191.731s">And,</a> um, I almost missed the opportunity to ask for the funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=196.293s">Um,</a> so I wanted to mention it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=198.213s">I</a> don't know if it's a good time, but I wanted to mention that, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=202.746s">I</a> did talk to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=204.267s">Lasky,</a> and she was interested in doing another field trip between the elementary school and the vocational school, like the biotech. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=212.071s">She's</a> going to be having another aquaponics. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=214.972s">And</a> I wanted to mention, I don't know if it's something that I should put on the agenda, because it would be something that we would be doing in the spring, you know, once they're all set with their program.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=239.711s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=240.071s">So</a> I'll wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=240.631s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=241.151s">That's</a> what I'll probably do. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=242.892s">We'll</a> just accept 2016.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=259.536s">So</a> I also wanted to mention that, <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=262.784s">I</a> wanted to make sure that it was extended to all the elementary schools who were, you know, wanted to plan a field trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=270.126s">Um,</a> the ideal grade, you know, seemed to be like the fourth grade or fifth grade level because they could understand and they were, you know, doing the science program very similar to the vocational biotech and biotech and, um, engineering. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=285.211s">And</a> they also went for a walk in the fells. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=287.752s">So</a> they were old enough to understand in the same type of science program. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=292.255s">So</a> I just wanted to make that mention. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=295.217s">I</a> haven't heard from other elementary schools, but I think it was a great, great day, and it was just wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=301.401s">I</a> loved it, and I don't wanna forget and miss the opportunity, so I wanted to mention it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=307.865s">And,</a> yep.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=340.293s">Um,</a> motion approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=341.835s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=343.536s">I</a> have one more question that's different. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=346.298s">Um,</a> it, it has to do with the, <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=348.58s">And</a> I know, Pat, you helped answer the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=350.742s">It</a> has to do with the MBTA, the S-pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=354.265s">And</a> I didn't know if there was, you know, if, you know, do we previously, you know, provide the middle schools with the S-pass, like the MBTA S-pass for students at the discounted rate? <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=369.437s">I</a> know I reached out to my niece who was, you know, when she was at Arlington in her middle school, <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=375.994s">she</a> got the discounted student pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=378.596s">So</a> I didn't know if it was something that we did or we didn't do. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=382.058s">And</a> maybe some people are using it in addition to the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=386.001s">Because</a> I know we had the parent who was asking if we did provide those passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=391.785s">And</a> I just didn't know where that stood and if it was something that we were going to explore getting those S passes for the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=399.19s">I</a> did check around with the META. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=401.892s">And</a> it is something that would have to go through the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=406.042s">not</a> necessarily the MBTA, but it would be something that would be managed between the school system, you know, to, you know, to get those passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=414.569s">So</a> I didn't know if it was something that we were going to pursue or maybe do like a survey to find out how many middle school parents would be interested in getting the pass, you know, to see if it was worthwhile to put forward for the next school year.
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=432.33s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=559.641s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1921.904s">Oh,</a> could I just ask a question before we do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1925.565s">I</a> had a question I was waiting to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1928.545s">So</a> I wanted to know, because I know the results are coming out this week, <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1932.334s">And</a> so the parents or the students who are 10th graders, who are now juniors, they're going to get their results. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1942.036s">And</a> they need to know if they have to take the retest as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1947.977s">How</a> quickly is that information going to be made available to those parents and the students? <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1954.619s">Because</a> I know that there was prep work that was done, MCAS prep that's done. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1960.675s">what</a> are the plans for that, and are those students, if they have to take the retest, where the MCAS 2.0 isn't gonna be out till next spring, the students have to take the retest coming up this November, because that's, I don't know the exact date, but it's November, so what are the plans? <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1983.107s">My</a> son's a junior, and this is the big grade we're waiting for, and I know there's a lot of other parents out there <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1990.335s">So</a> it's, you know, a lot of anxiety around that, you know, scoring and, you know, and where is the new test, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1998.319s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=2084.386s">And</a> that's a concern because that was a great program. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=2088.008s">It</a> was like a six week program, you know, for the students who needed help with either math or the English. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=2093.351s">And,</a> you know, you know, is I'd like to I don't know if I could make a motion that we can make some budget money available for those students, you know, to get the prep and the assistance they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=2106.0s">you</a> know, to help them so they can graduate, because this is a big deal and, you know, students need the assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=2113.345s">You</a> know, some of them struggle with testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=2117.188s">A</a> lot of the strategies I know, you know, that the students learned was, you know, helpful, and the repetition, you know, and where there was a break over the summer and, you know, things are, you know, getting back into the swing of things, you know, I think it's definitely something that we need to make a priority for the students.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5272.479s">Over</a> the weekend while I was away, Lisa Evangelista, the PR person, <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5276.974s">She</a> shared an article that was in the Boston Globe when the Salamanders were released that made it to the Globe. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5283.458s">So</a> I was away, out of town, and I was notified in an email. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5286.861s">It</a> was just wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5287.621s">I</a> was so happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5288.322s">I</a> was like, oh my gosh, this article in the paper is about the Salamanders. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5291.924s">It</a> was just wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5293.565s">So</a> I mean, I think, I mean, when I first ran for office, I wanted to do my own PR. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5300.69s">I</a> wanted to capture every story. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5302.111s">I</a> wanted to get every picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5303.191s">I</a> wanted to get it out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5304.512s">And</a> I created a website. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5306.318s">And</a> I couldn't do my job at work and then on the school committee and keep up with the pictures and the articles and the stories, but I wanted to. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5316.207s">But</a> I couldn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5316.987s">I</a> tried. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5318.188s">So</a> I feel like, I think I almost tried to mimic what Lisa was doing for the whole community. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5325.405s">It's</a> like a job on its own. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5328.248s">You</a> know, when I would go home at night, and I would try to do my pictures, and do my posts, and do the article, and write it in such a way, and then it was so late, and I was making mistakes, you know, because I was trying to squeeze it in, to get the information out there on Facebook. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5342.761s">to</a> share with the community, this is what our schools are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5346.223s">So</a> it's actually, I mean, I really enjoy it because, you know, while we're at work and while we're going about our business, even on the weekend, you know, she's still working or getting those posts out there that can be shared with everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5360.27s">I</a> mean, I just really like it, you know, and I tell her all the time, and Allison, <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5366.349s">I</a> just really like hearing what's going on and reading about the students and everything that's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5371.591s">It</a> just kind of makes my weekend, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5373.592s">But</a> I just wanted to share it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5374.872s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5375.592s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Kathy Kreatz]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6571.877s">Thank</a> you, Pat, for your report. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6573.418s">I</a> always enjoy them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6574.159s">I</a> like reading them because they're easy to read instead of the numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6577.598s">I</a> just have a question, because I know you're working with Transfinder, and I wanted to just check in with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6585.74s">There</a> was an open issue with a person that called last year, and he's called again this year, and he wanted to have his bus stop moved from Waddell and Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6598.803s">So</a> I'm wondering if there's any way to check in with the Transfinder and see if there's another route that might be possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6605.748s">even</a> a little ways down the street, there was another corner that I had met with this resident once before, but on Park Ave, the next street over, that was almost a better location, and it's still gonna come up the same route, it's gonna come up Highland, the kids aren't gonna get out on the Highland Ave, and the bus would take the right onto Park Ave, <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6630.633s">and</a> just go right by Waddell to the very next corner, which is almost like the size of the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6637.136s">And</a> the bus could stop nicely right there, and then cars couldn't get around. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6641.959s">I</a> know it's ideal with the four-corner stop, but what the resident told me was that what he saw was cars were going around the bus, even when the lights were on. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6652.965s">And</a> he said it was more of a safety issue, because even though the lights would be on, the cars would just, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6659.832s">going</a> around it, you know, even though it's against the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6662.476s">they</a> were, you know, and so, you know, that was just an idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6666.378s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6666.879s">If</a> we had to just move it just a nudge over to the next street, which is really just like 50 feet.

href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3461.174s">And,</a> um, I, I did respond to your email and I let you know that, you know, I'm new. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3466.836s">There's</a> a couple of other new people here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3468.316s">And</a> that night, typically we get an agenda and it tells us what's going to be on the agenda that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3475.118s">And</a> we get the information that we can read through. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3477.539s">So</a> the night that you were here, you weren't on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3481.2s">I</a> really haven't experienced a lot of people coming that aren't on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3485.342s">So</a> I didn't have any information to even speak on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3488.923s">the</a> evaluation of the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3491.124s">I</a> know from my work experience where I work, I work at Mass Teachers Retirement System, and I work with over 40 school districts, and I hear from my payroll people all the time how upsetting it is when they see a superintendent go, because they get a superintendent when somebody retires, and the superintendents are coming and going all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3513.976s">And</a> when they come and go, they also come in and they reorganize. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3518.565s">and</a> they get their staff in there or their administration in there, and they set new rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3524.009s">So</a> then it sends a lot of teachers off going and a lot of people moving out of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3528.673s">So</a> I agree with my colleagues that we need to take a lot of time doing the search, because we don't want to get somebody from Chicago, which I've just heard from one of my school districts, because they lost their superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3541.303s">They</a> got a new superintendent for two years after training the new superintendent, and now they have somebody from Chicago coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3548.223s">who</a> doesn't know anything about their district. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3550.725s">So</a> I think that it's going to take time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3553.967s">I</a> don't know how much time, but we do have coming up the 23rd, I thought it was, is the evening with the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3562.094s">That's</a> for the public, where everybody can go. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3565.076s">And</a> we're invited to go as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3566.777s">And</a> I'm going to take notes, because what I heard was that we could take notes at the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3571.421s">And</a> all of the meetings in all the past have been public meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3575.624s">So</a> all the minutes are available. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3577.655s">which</a> is transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3580.836s">Honestly,</a> I didn't have time to go and look for all those meeting minutes, but it's all available at any time for anybody to get. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3588.277s">It's</a> just a matter of, I know where I work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3590.497s">We</a> have to go into the archive bulletins. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3592.818s">It</a> might be something like that because we have so much data to go into the websites. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3596.698s">It</a> might be in a different area that we might have to reach somebody in the IT or the technical office to find out exactly where they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3604.42s">Honestly,</a> I don't know, but no, I think <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3607.197s">You</a> know, it's definitely something we have to consider and take a lot of time to do the search to actually get another superstar like Roy, because he's been doing a terrific job. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3616.28s">You</a> know, students rave about what he's doing, parents rave about what he's doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3621.661s">You</a> know, we have a lot of good, positive feedback, and I do appreciate everything you've said, and I hope you got my email when I responded. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3629.643s">I</a> did, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3630.304s">Okay,</a> thank you.
