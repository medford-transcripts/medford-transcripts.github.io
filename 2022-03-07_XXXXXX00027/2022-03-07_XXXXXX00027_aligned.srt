1
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:05,820
Hey Medford Bites listeners.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,043
Before we get into today's interview, I wanted to give a brief update about Charter Review.

3
00:00:10,704 --> 00:00:15,807
The scheduled meeting of the whole to discuss the Home Rule petition was cancelled and has not yet been rescheduled.

4
00:00:16,608 --> 00:00:19,670
This is an unfortunate delay in the process of advancing Charter Review.

5
00:00:20,391 --> 00:00:27,796
The Medford Charter Review Coalition, a group seeking to get the ball rolling on a review, is meeting on Wednesday, March 10th at 7pm.

6
00:00:28,557 --> 00:00:31,059
The Zoom link is in the show notes for those who would like to attend.

7
00:00:32,113 --> 00:00:35,054
Today's interview is a crossover with another local podcaster.

8
00:00:35,555 --> 00:00:36,235
I hope you enjoy.

9
00:00:36,255 --> 00:00:46,520
All right, thank you so much for meeting with me tonight.

10
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,522
If you don't mind introducing yourself, just say your name, pronouns, and a bit about yourself.

11
00:00:51,121 --> 00:00:53,543
Yeah, I mean, I'm Anthony Petrellis.

12
00:00:53,903 --> 00:00:57,826
I'm the host of Beyond Podcast.

13
00:00:58,187 --> 00:01:01,329
And thank you for having me.

14
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:03,031
You reached out to me about coming on here.

15
00:01:03,051 --> 00:01:05,132
I'm from Medford.

16
00:01:05,152 --> 00:01:07,034
I grew up in Medford pretty much my entire life.

17
00:01:07,054 --> 00:01:11,517
So to be able to come on here and be a part of something from the city is kind of cool.

18
00:01:11,558 --> 00:01:12,698
So yeah, I'm really excited.

19
00:01:13,099 --> 00:01:16,041
Yeah, and could you share your pronouns a little bit?

20
00:01:16,542 --> 00:01:16,802
He.

21
00:01:17,162 --> 00:01:17,622
Yeah, awesome.

22
00:01:17,662 --> 00:01:17,823
Thanks.

23
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,525
Yeah, and you also are a teacher in Medford?

24
00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:24,641
I am a fifth grade teacher at the McGlynn elementary school.

25
00:01:24,681 --> 00:01:24,901
Yeah.

26
00:01:24,921 --> 00:01:28,203
So I've been, I've been at it for, this will be my 15th year coming up.

27
00:01:28,263 --> 00:01:28,624
Yeah.

28
00:01:28,644 --> 00:01:30,765
So fifth grade.

29
00:01:31,626 --> 00:01:34,527
Yeah.

30
00:01:35,848 --> 00:01:36,188
Cool.

31
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:44,514
So the question that I just, it's kind of like a common thread through every episode is just to ask what your favorite place to eat in Medford is and what you like to eat there.

32
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:46,598
Yeah, I mean that's a tough one.

33
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:59,790
Um, you know, I hope I could give two answers here and I'll explain why but I mean I grew up in Mefford I grew up in South Mefford and a big spot that we used to go was Tony by George and that was a huge sub shop in the South Mefford area.

34
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:04,614
I think it's like a pizza place now from what I've seen just driving by it but

35
00:02:04,974 --> 00:02:10,996
I used to get a cheeseburger twist there, which was like a wrap with cheeseburger, lettuce, tomato, french fries.

36
00:02:11,096 --> 00:02:15,378
And I mean, it's not the healthiest thing in the world, but it was very good.

37
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:18,179
And so that would be my all time.

38
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,741
But right now, currently, I would say, you know, I like going to Razzos and the Chicken Palm.

39
00:02:23,781 --> 00:02:27,943
I think that that's a really good size plate and a really fair price.

40
00:02:28,043 --> 00:02:33,005
So I would say that that's kind of my my go to place to grab a bite to eat.

41
00:02:33,483 --> 00:02:33,903
Oh, great.

42
00:02:33,943 --> 00:02:34,223
Thanks.

43
00:02:34,383 --> 00:02:36,084
I appreciate the thoughtfulness there.

44
00:02:36,184 --> 00:02:39,405
I know it can be sometimes the hardest question that people answer on the podcast.

45
00:02:39,445 --> 00:02:41,786
Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

46
00:02:41,906 --> 00:02:42,186
Awesome.

47
00:02:42,546 --> 00:02:44,807
So I was hoping we talk a little bit about your podcast.

48
00:02:45,107 --> 00:02:51,049
So if you could talk about how you got into it, how you decided to start it and what it's been like for you.

49
00:02:51,871 --> 00:03:16,068
Yeah, so, um, during the pandemic and I'm sure everybody starts rethinking everything and like their lives a little bit and, you know, I was on top being a teacher I was also a high school football coach for pretty much like parallel to my teaching career so I felt like both really helped me get better at the other as far as like communication organization like all of that and so when I had babies and had twins I was a head football coach

50
00:03:17,065 --> 00:03:27,063
at Arlington Catholic High School and it was hard balancing it all like it really was because you know being a teacher and being a coach a coach is.

51
00:03:27,727 --> 00:03:46,939
really kind of like a full time gig in a lot of ways and how you run your program and it is year round in a lot of ways, even though it might not be on the field, there's so much that you do off the field too so once I had my own children I just realized that it was just too difficult to balance at all you know I kind of stepped away from doing that and in that process of being home and really thinking.

52
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:57,744
Social media was like a huge part of like me recruiting and help getting kids to come maybe want to play football at our program, you know, because we were a school that attracted from a lot of different cities and towns.

53
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:04,107
And I try getting people to come in and do like little documentaries and things like that, because I felt like that's a way of showing your program off.

54
00:04:04,227 --> 00:04:07,028
And I just found that there was really nothing out there like that.

55
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:14,051
And it was hard to find somebody to come in and do that because it's a lot of work or cameras or whatever it is.

56
00:04:14,091 --> 00:04:16,692
And not a lot of people have that experience of doing it.

57
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:35,741
Um, you know, I decided that I wanted to kind of venture into starting a podcast of interviewing coaches, um, of all sports, you know, boy, girl, whatever, you know, like, and, um, and I found that coaches were really eager, especially during the pandemic to want to talk about their programs and to keep themselves relevant.

58
00:04:35,781 --> 00:04:42,065
And maybe for those private schools or Catholic schools, like they're trying to recruit in and they don't have a season or anything to show for it.

59
00:04:42,145 --> 00:04:45,067
So, um, we got a really good, like.

60
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:51,755
Like, people wanted to be on it and I was only on Twitter and YouTube for the first like five months and that was it.

61
00:04:51,975 --> 00:05:05,486
And then I realized how important Instagram was and then I realized how important like Spotify and Apple and all that and really getting it out there so I feel like last January was when I say I really started realizing the potential of it.

62
00:05:06,287 --> 00:05:19,330
And then we took advantage of like fall sports are coming back so let's, you know, go off high school football games and just catch the atmosphere and, you know, talk to the players and the cheerleaders and the athletic directors and the student section and.

63
00:05:19,851 --> 00:05:36,814
rate their concession stand like we had fun with it and what we found like every week somebody was like kind of reaching out to us being like hey, you know, would you come and do that here like we have a great home crowd and you know and so before you know it became a thing that high schools were interested in us coming in, you know, and

64
00:05:37,841 --> 00:05:41,304
that turned into this winter in which we've been just covering all everything.

65
00:05:41,324 --> 00:05:51,013
We covered gymnastics, basketball, hockey, swimming, like, you know, and it's just been, it's been fun and there's like a demand for it.

66
00:05:51,113 --> 00:05:53,776
So, um, we've really grown in the last year.

67
00:05:53,796 --> 00:05:54,657
It's a lot of work.

68
00:05:54,717 --> 00:05:58,861
It's, it's a lot of work on the side and this is not my full-time gig.

69
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:03,385
So, um, balance and structure, I think again, talking about like,

70
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:06,904
coaching and all of that and teaching, like I've learned that in my life.

71
00:06:06,964 --> 00:06:08,325
I've learned how to kind of do that.

72
00:06:08,405 --> 00:06:13,970
So it's been a little bit easy to transition into that, but it's a lot of work, you know?

73
00:06:14,971 --> 00:06:15,211
Yeah.

74
00:06:15,271 --> 00:06:15,471
Wow.

75
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:18,754
And it's, I think it's an interesting overlap, right?

76
00:06:18,774 --> 00:06:22,477
Like, like being with kids in school and also being around kids as a coach.

77
00:06:23,338 --> 00:06:31,265
And I guess I wonder like the focus on, on athletics, sort of what you kind of see as the importance of that for young kids.

78
00:06:32,428 --> 00:06:47,278
Yeah, I think, I think, you know, athletics is a lot of work like you know when I was in school like it was always a joke of like athletes like oh they don't they're not like hold it in the classroom or whatever like there was always that little thing and I think that that's so false because.

79
00:06:48,272 --> 00:07:10,046
on top of balancing an academic schedule you're also acting you're balancing a full-time you know being on a team and being committed and and that includes your off season of getting into shape or maybe playing another sport and kind of really being on the go a lot and I feel like for myself that was always like the balance and structure in my life and helped me kind of always

80
00:07:11,147 --> 00:07:18,371
be able to handle a lot because you always were handling a lot, whether you realize it or not, like you were having fun doing that.

81
00:07:18,531 --> 00:07:30,557
And so once I've been in the coaching world and to see like what some of these kids do, and some kids that I coached on the academy, some of these kids have gone on to like Harvard and Yale, like very smart, smart individuals that you're coaching.

82
00:07:30,597 --> 00:07:34,899
And it was easy to coach them because you could give them a lot, you know?

83
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,480
And so I just feel like

84
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:49,791
being able to show that off that happens everywhere and it happens in all different sports and I just think it's great to highlight student athletes to see what they put into I mean we interview players pre game post game.

85
00:07:50,591 --> 00:07:51,892
And we really try to like.

86
00:07:52,993 --> 00:08:13,124
ask them questions that really make them shine because I think that that's important at the end of the day that people understand who they are as a person, not necessarily just like having one judgment on them you have a slew of things to be able to say wow, they're pretty good player they're pretty well spoken they're really nice person in school like it helps build them up to I think a little bit.

87
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,341
Yeah, totally.

88
00:08:14,381 --> 00:08:27,816
I think about like sports and like citizenship, that sort of connection of like, it reminds me of like, growing up, there was a show, I don't know if it's still on channel five, but it was called like high five where they would highlight either like one athlete or a team.

89
00:08:28,157 --> 00:08:30,780
I always wanted to like one of my teams to get on that show.

90
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:39,152
But it was like about that right that balance of like yes like you're a good athlete and like you like are doing good things and you're contributing to your community.

91
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:45,842
My dad was he was actually coaching the Middlesex League for like 30 years of like all the running sports.

92
00:08:46,162 --> 00:08:55,825
But he talks a lot about how that discipline, like the discipline about like around sports, you can see as runners, like they like they applied that to their academics and just their lives in general.

93
00:08:55,845 --> 00:09:03,467
And that and for me personally, like to that, that structure of playing sports through high school and college, like it's like you have that team.

94
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:15,170
And I think that if you play a team sport or individual sport and that sort of like discipline and ability to work with other people and like, you know, sort of practice leadership in different ways really translates well to.

95
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,672
Yeah.

96
00:09:17,152 --> 00:09:30,309
And I think yeah like the number one thing is always like, you know, time management and I think that that's such a skill that's needed because I know people personally who are not very time manager like they're not very good at it and.

97
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:37,731
As I get older, especially when I have kids, that's even more important to be able to understand balance.

98
00:09:38,172 --> 00:09:41,432
As much as I love doing this podcast, I love being dad too.

99
00:09:41,632 --> 00:09:45,053
And so I always make sure that I'm very balanced with that.

100
00:09:45,493 --> 00:09:49,414
I don't try to have this take away a lot from that.

101
00:09:49,494 --> 00:09:50,814
This is more done at night.

102
00:09:50,854 --> 00:09:51,854
My house is asleep.

103
00:09:52,255 --> 00:09:53,495
My wife's in bed.

104
00:09:54,395 --> 00:09:56,956
This is when now I get to really kind of work on this.

105
00:09:59,476 --> 00:10:01,742
time management for me is everything.

106
00:10:01,762 --> 00:10:07,495
So being able to show those qualities off and how important they are, I think is good for anybody, you know.

107
00:10:08,758 --> 00:10:09,018
Yeah.

108
00:10:09,038 --> 00:10:13,839
And, and I guess I wonder kind of what you hope in terms of like an impact of your podcast.

109
00:10:13,859 --> 00:10:19,221
So like kids seeing this coaches like community members, like, what do you, what do you want folks to take away from you?

110
00:10:20,001 --> 00:10:28,823
I mean, for me personally, I would really want to make a dent in being a person who is able to cover a program and all the good that it has.

111
00:10:28,903 --> 00:10:32,424
I think no matter what type of media it is, you hear it's

112
00:10:32,744 --> 00:10:34,806
there's always a negative twist to something.

113
00:10:35,146 --> 00:10:36,407
And that happens a lot.

114
00:10:36,547 --> 00:10:46,636
And I think that what we're doing here and highlighting coaches and highlighting athletes and schools and athletic directors and districts, like that's important.

115
00:10:46,696 --> 00:10:53,002
And I think that that's the message that I want to get out there is that everybody's kind of up against it.

116
00:10:53,042 --> 00:10:55,824
And since the pandemic, everybody even more so.

117
00:10:55,944 --> 00:10:59,368
So it is nice to shine light and shine positivity

118
00:11:00,168 --> 00:11:04,869
on student athletes and what their schools and districts and coaches do for them.

119
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:08,610
I think that that's just, it's awesome and fun that I get to do it.

120
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:16,632
I got to coach and that's what I did for a lot of my life is play sports and coach sports and build relationships.

121
00:11:16,732 --> 00:11:19,073
And that's what this is kind of all about.

122
00:11:19,113 --> 00:11:22,354
It's really putting what I feel like I do best all together.

123
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,159
Yeah, that's awesome.

124
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:28,820
And I appreciate the range of what you do cover in terms of sports.

125
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:34,601
Like I think, you know, a lot of, like, I think that like a lot of media gives attention to like football and basketball.

126
00:11:34,621 --> 00:11:47,704
And like, you know, I appreciate the sort of inclusivity around like both boys and girls sports, the maybe less covered sports like gymnastics and swimming and things like that maybe didn't always feel so glamorous, but they're getting there.

127
00:11:48,944 --> 00:11:59,127
And I think that that's what's so unique you know we did a gymnastics event, and that was literally my favorite I think was my favorite one I covered, because I didn't really know what I was doing and I didn't really know what I was looking for.

128
00:11:59,707 --> 00:12:05,429
But I felt like I could just feel it when I was there and be like, Okay, I know I want to put a camera here.

129
00:12:05,789 --> 00:12:07,730
This is perfect to cover this angle like.

130
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:27,551
And my wife came with me and and we had like a blast like she was helping me out and taking great video and she was, you know, she was a gymnast or she like understood like we can't stand here we got to be quiet like okay like you know so it was it was fun going in covering something that you really didn't know what you were going into until you did.

131
00:12:28,472 --> 00:12:29,073
I had a blast.

132
00:12:29,113 --> 00:12:34,879
I told the coach, I was like, this was like one of my favorite events because it was it was like a lot of athleticism.

133
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:36,040
The kids were great.

134
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:37,362
It was fun.

135
00:12:37,442 --> 00:12:38,163
It was a lot of fun.

136
00:12:38,183 --> 00:12:39,064
That's awesome.

137
00:12:39,484 --> 00:12:44,650
Are there any sports that you're that you haven't covered that you're sort of excited to or anticipate you might start covering?

138
00:12:45,310 --> 00:13:09,225
Yeah you know in the spring like we have a lot going on so like we cover sports but we also have like a little bit of a range like we do do stuff with food and food establishments like a place to go after a game to grab a great bite to eat or drink and that's like one of our big things we did in the summer was called our beyond main course and you know we highlighted a few places and you know we're looking to kind of do a little something like that but we also want to start

139
00:13:09,645 --> 00:13:11,947
meeting with some of our guests a little bit live.

140
00:13:12,007 --> 00:13:27,436
And we thought what better way to do that a little bit is even if you brought on like a typical podcast episode for me is between like the 40 and 50 minute range, but we've done a couple live ones that we've done like 20, 25 minutes and like analytically it's been like very good.

141
00:13:27,596 --> 00:13:37,082
So I think, you know, that's kind of like, we do dabble in a lot of different things, but you know, as far as like the sports go, like,

142
00:13:37,518 --> 00:13:46,744
anything like I've never covered lacrosse has ever cut baseball like softball something I, I think would be a lot of fun like I think you could really do a lot with softball.

143
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:50,027
I've watched girls softball and the energy is just awesome.

144
00:13:50,307 --> 00:13:56,571
And I think we would have a lot of fun covering covering that like the bench, everything, it'd be a lot of fun.

145
00:13:57,892 --> 00:13:58,873
Lacrosse is my sport.

146
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:20,308
Yeah, and I think lacrosse would be lacrosse to me is like the biggest challenge because I think in order to keep up with the game of lacrosse, you're going to have to be running in like you're kind of going to be going back and forth with the camera and catching things and I think that lacrosse is going to be a lot tougher than like I'm excited to cover it but I'm also really nervous to cover it because

147
00:14:20,828 --> 00:14:25,796
least gymnastics you're confined to an area and I can see the event that's going on like lacrosse.

148
00:14:26,336 --> 00:14:32,626
Everyone's running the balls moving it thrown it down feel like yeah it's gonna be a lot, that's going to be fun, but it'll be fun.

149
00:14:33,227 --> 00:14:33,687
That's cool.

150
00:14:34,228 --> 00:14:34,589
Yeah.

151
00:14:36,023 --> 00:14:36,283
Awesome.

152
00:14:36,323 --> 00:14:39,986
Are there any other things that you're working on that you want to mention or anything that I haven't asked about this.

153
00:14:40,907 --> 00:14:57,080
Um, you know right now we have a couple fun things that are brewing you know we we have a fun episode coming out soon so so we are doing, I have another person who works with me on this he does a lot of my editing his name is john john sensor bar and he's he's awesome he's.

154
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:21,847
so talented like he's kind of jumped on board once it really started taking off and my editing skills were very limited and and he kind of came on board and really like changed what we were able to get across and how we were able to get it across and I feel like you know we've been dabbling in a few different things as far as just like having fun because

155
00:15:22,587 --> 00:15:47,870
Sports is like you enjoy it like myself, but not not everyone does so we want to make sure that we have listeners and have range of listeners, because we cover different things so doing things like that with the food or, you know, we've like covered like like when we cover them polls and method during the the election like we went around and interview people holding signs and we had a lot of fun like a lot of laughs we met a lot of cool people and so.

156
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:56,933
those have been some of our biggest views and that's how we've gained a lot of followers because people are seeing that we have a little bit of range and that we're not just kind of one little thing.

157
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,594
Those sports is like the big chunk of it.

158
00:15:59,654 --> 00:16:05,976
Like we do dabble and have fun and you know, we've been on, we, we've been like wanting to collaborate with a few people.

159
00:16:05,996 --> 00:16:13,298
So we have a few collaborations that are coming up that crossover episodes are being on somebody's podcast like yourself and,

160
00:16:13,968 --> 00:16:20,713
Um, you know, being able to really get our message out there year two of kind of who we are and getting more exposure.

161
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:26,356
So, um, that's kind of what we have brewing as far as big picture stuff.

162
00:16:26,396 --> 00:16:30,639
But again, we have a lot of sports teams that we're going to be working with in the summer for workouts.

163
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,541
And, um, you know, we, we really want to be fun.

164
00:16:33,601 --> 00:16:36,223
We really want to be fun and be unique and different and, um,

165
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:54,870
I feel like that's kind of the direction we're going and I don't know what it is or what the end point is but I just feel like every time we turn down one road, we find a couple more roads to travel like oh this is interesting like let's try this out so it's been fun kind of inventing yourselves a little bit along the way to.

166
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,821
That sounds really fun.

167
00:16:56,861 --> 00:17:01,645
Is it, has there been any road that you've gone down that you've been like, well, maybe not anything that's been like challenging or.

168
00:17:02,445 --> 00:17:12,573
Um, you know, I think the challenging thing is, is that when people are interested to do things with you, you just can't do everything, you know?

169
00:17:12,753 --> 00:17:24,102
And I feel like sometimes the biggest challenge is, is saying no to people, uh, because you look at it as one way to really help yourself out and get yourself out there more.

170
00:17:24,475 --> 00:17:25,896
but it also comes at a price.

171
00:17:25,956 --> 00:17:33,022
It comes with time and it comes with maybe editing and it comes with, um, you know, having to rearrange a schedule.

172
00:17:33,102 --> 00:17:47,754
So it's like, sometimes like that's, I find this really hard because you're so eager and passionate about, like, I'm sure you are that like, if you had the opportunity to step on the gas pedal and try to go, like you're going to whatever you can.

173
00:17:47,774 --> 00:17:51,758
So saying no, sometimes is really the hardest thing I find with this podcast.

174
00:17:52,575 --> 00:18:00,200
Yeah, sounds like to like especially we're kind of trying to define what it is that like you know the things that you do want to focus on probably involves saying notice something.

175
00:18:00,721 --> 00:18:02,802
Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.

176
00:18:04,354 --> 00:18:24,239
like I teach in Medford, so, you know, I also find it like a responsibility of mine to put a product out there that is very family and kid friendly, that really highlights, you know, these kids are teenagers when they're in high school, but I teach a grade of 10 and 11 year old kids.

177
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:25,719
So they were there at one point.

178
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:26,119
And so,

179
00:18:26,801 --> 00:18:32,434
These kids are 17, 18 years old, but six or seven years ago, they would have been a student in my class.

180
00:18:32,454 --> 00:18:36,122
So, you know, I also feel a responsibility that when I do this, like

181
00:18:36,871 --> 00:18:41,094
it's clean fun, it's enjoyable fun, it's family fun.

182
00:18:41,194 --> 00:18:49,438
And I know that kids eventually gonna have social media and I covered some teams in Medford that had students in my class that were on the team.

183
00:18:49,518 --> 00:18:51,439
And so it's cool to see them in that light.

184
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,120
And I know they're watching it.

185
00:18:53,160 --> 00:19:00,925
So I have a responsibility to also make sure that I'm doing it very tastefully and that it's also entertaining and that can be hard to balance too.

186
00:19:00,945 --> 00:19:01,585
So yeah.

187
00:19:01,645 --> 00:19:05,888
So do your students listen to the podcast?

188
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:10,784
Yeah, you know, because we're on YouTube and YouTube's hugely good 10 and 11 year olds.

189
00:19:10,864 --> 00:19:16,228
I said this to somebody before that, like every year, you know, when you ask kids, like, what do you, what do you want to be when you grow up?

190
00:19:16,268 --> 00:19:18,369
What do you, you know, what do you think you want to be?

191
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:27,276
And every year you, and I've said this to somebody else before, but YouTuber is like, it's, it's growing, like it's growing as like a profession that kids want to be.

192
00:19:27,296 --> 00:19:33,000
And I, I guess I just didn't understand that world until I started doing this podcast and,

193
00:19:33,483 --> 00:19:41,869
You know I have like, I think like 173 or four subscribers like that's not a lot right like compared to some people like 10,000 you know a million or whatever.

194
00:19:43,128 --> 00:20:03,597
And these kids think I'm God that like I have 173 and I'm like, Oh my god, how am I going to get this up and these kids like you like how many do you have like seven I'm like, Oh, okay, you know, like, you know, it's funny that stuff's funny and and so they definitely listen to it and, you know, I've had parents like even reach out and

195
00:20:04,057 --> 00:20:22,992
Because we have a t shirts or whatever you know and so we had like a fundraiser that we did we had a one year celebration, and we raise money for the foodie foundation I have my twins are both diagnosed with autism and so that that foundation means a lot to us and the research that we've done on it and so, and we felt, you know,

196
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:46,353
means Doug Flutie like he's like legend around here you know so and so we now work with them we were able to put like a communication board at the Wildwood school which is in Wilmington where we where we reside now and our kids attend that school and we use a lot of communication boards at home and you know that was how we've really like helped with the communication because during the pandemic it's like

197
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,996
you're doing the like early intervention, you're doing all that stuff, but it's on zoom.

198
00:20:50,036 --> 00:20:54,979
And it's just like, it's hard to keep like your one and a half year old, two year old, like in front of the computer.

199
00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:03,566
So you really had to learn what they were doing and, and do it yourself, you know, and be like, okay, this is what we have to do with them, you know?

200
00:21:03,706 --> 00:21:11,312
And so, um, but so, you know, I really think that there's just a lot of positivity that you can put out there in a time that's,

201
00:21:12,073 --> 00:21:27,756
Not everything's positive so that's where I try to be different and and you know for some people that it's enjoyable and some people, it's not and that's okay and so, you know, I try to put a product out there that best represents me and what I want to represent so.

202
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:36,330
Yeah, it sounds like putting positivity out there and also like sort of having access to that positivity for yourself during this like pretty difficult time for all of us.

203
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:49,975
Yeah, and I think like if my kids are growing up, eventually, if I'm still doing this, and I'm actually end up being pretty good at it, like, yeah, I wouldn't want them to watch dad stuff that's like, not tasteful or not appropriate or not like respectful.

204
00:21:50,095 --> 00:21:50,915
So it's

205
00:21:51,295 --> 00:22:03,288
So, you know, I keep that in mind, and anything that I do but you know right now it's my students like it's cool that they watch it but I also, you know, I understand that comes with the responsibility and, you know, it's fine.

206
00:22:06,196 --> 00:22:06,436
That's cool.

207
00:22:06,496 --> 00:22:11,499
And I imagine someday some of their fifth graders will be on some of these high school teams that you're covering too.

208
00:22:11,859 --> 00:22:12,059
Yeah.

209
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:14,140
And they have been like the basketball team.

210
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,962
There was three kids, you know, and I have like the video saved it.

211
00:22:16,982 --> 00:22:18,763
I'm like, this is something I want to hang on to.

212
00:22:18,823 --> 00:22:24,366
Cause if I see these kids five years down the road, I'll be like, Hey, remember when I covered you guys and I have this cool clip.

213
00:22:24,406 --> 00:22:30,329
They'd be like, Oh my God, you have this clip of me when I was 18 in high school, you know, like they love, they eat that stuff up.

214
00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:31,750
So it's just, uh,

215
00:22:32,487 --> 00:22:33,087
Yeah, it's fun.

216
00:22:33,548 --> 00:22:34,408
Wow, that's really cool.

217
00:22:34,889 --> 00:22:40,372
Do you have any advice for for some of these like student athletes say anything that you would like want them to know?

218
00:22:41,613 --> 00:22:49,119
Yeah, I just think being a coach for for a really long time and in recently not like in the past way a long time ago.

219
00:22:49,139 --> 00:23:05,712
I just feel like if you really want to be something like as far as you like your goal is to play college football your goal is to be a college basketball player or your goals to play at that next level, no matter what it is division one division two division three.

220
00:23:06,573 --> 00:23:32,377
it's about putting in the work like everybody can say that's what they want to do and that's what everybody can try to do but you play at that next level it's tough and I just think that you know it's important to realize that and that there are important things in life like having your family and your friends and balancing your academics so you know if you're committed to wanting to do that it's not just balancing that it's balancing everything else because schools

221
00:23:32,897 --> 00:23:58,915
there's a lot of talented kids out there but schools are looking for the kids that are well balanced and well rounded and are humble and you know so when you kind of look to achieve your goals and what it is that you want to do and play at that next level it's not just about the on the field stuff it's really important about the off the field stuff too that would that would be my advice yeah that's great that's good advice that yeah to have that balance yeah yeah

222
00:23:59,677 --> 00:23:59,897
Yeah.

223
00:24:00,197 --> 00:24:02,640
So yeah, it's, it's, it's fun to cover that.

224
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:08,224
And it's fun to put that message out there, you know, of, of being able to show that off.

225
00:24:08,264 --> 00:24:15,090
Like I've had a couple of coaches on there that have gone for interviews that I've been able to like send clips to them.

226
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:26,320
So they have like, to be able to send to the athletic directors to be like, Hey, I was on this podcast and I was asked certain things about my program or what I would do if I had a head coaching job.

227
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:32,427
here and I just feel like that's a cool leg up for coaches to be able to use that.

228
00:24:32,567 --> 00:24:49,503
So you know it in some cases it worked in some cases it didn't but to be able to also kind of provide that was like when they asked me I'm like yeah like and I'm like re-watching the episode being like I'm gonna send you like three or four of them and you can pick the best one you like you know because

229
00:24:51,252 --> 00:25:11,401
people did that for me way back when and not necessarily the video way but they vouch for you or they spoke for you or they write you a letter of recommendation like this is a virtual letter of recommendation that I can really kind of give them and I think it's like a professional development like there's other coaches listening to this and they're like oh wow I'm going to try that with my program or

230
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:15,163
Like, it's just, there's so many ways you can go with it.

231
00:25:15,203 --> 00:25:19,706
And I think that that's why I'm having so much fun because I haven't, I'm not stuck.

232
00:25:19,746 --> 00:25:23,669
Like, it's just always something like, oh, we can, let's go down this road a little bit, you know?

233
00:25:23,729 --> 00:25:25,090
So it's fun.

234
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:25,830
It is fun.

235
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:35,096
I imagine that's helpful for the students too, to have like, if there's like videos or clips of them playing their sports for them to be able to use for recruiting purposes and things like that.

236
00:25:35,257 --> 00:25:36,197
Oh, absolutely.

237
00:25:36,237 --> 00:25:37,818
You know, we've been able to do that.

238
00:25:37,938 --> 00:25:38,479
It's funny.

239
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:56,669
You know what, and I'm not like this like oh I played sports, 25 years ago but you know but like when I like when I lost a game I was, you know, really bummed out about it, and not like caring about anything and maybe that's just like a young teen boy attitude or whatever you want to say when it came to sports back then but

240
00:25:58,996 --> 00:26:13,058
I feel like I cover games and teams will lose like a really close game and 20 minutes later it's like messaging me on Instagram like hey I saw that you were right there my three pointer do you have video that to send to me and I'm like wait that's what you're thinking.

241
00:26:14,499 --> 00:26:17,340
I would not be thinking about that, you know.

242
00:26:17,521 --> 00:26:33,247
And so I have found that, yeah, I've been able to do that, you know, put some clips together, uh, specifically in Medford for the football team, because we did cover them a few different times and, you know, they had a pretty good wide receiver who I, who I, he's playing, I think in like division two, but he's very good.

243
00:26:33,427 --> 00:26:39,610
And, um, you know, we kept the camera on him a little bit because I felt like every time they needed something, they kind of go to him and he

244
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:45,216
You do it, you know, so it was fun being able to help out with things like that.

245
00:26:46,357 --> 00:26:59,311
But I also think like a fun part of it was covering like the student section of games like going in like kids are going crazy and you're just like talking to them and, you know, we covered one town in particular and Stoneham.

246
00:27:00,172 --> 00:27:11,642
And the student section loved us, loved us, you know, and we had gone back to a second game because they were playing like in a championship game, which just happened to be coincidence that we covered another team that they were playing.

247
00:27:11,662 --> 00:27:15,665
So we're like, well, let's go back and cover them both because we've already covered them one each.

248
00:27:15,705 --> 00:27:17,387
And now they're playing for like a league title.

249
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:18,228
Like this is cool.

250
00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:20,069
Middlesex.

251
00:27:20,089 --> 00:27:23,632
So it was like Wilmington and Stoneham, like Middlesex league team.

252
00:27:23,672 --> 00:27:24,953
So that was kind of the game.

253
00:27:25,093 --> 00:27:25,494
And so

254
00:27:26,555 --> 00:27:44,091
And, and so the students section like the second time we went back there they were like loving it like trying to call us over there and then I cover the stonem hockey team this season the kid who was like the biggest cheer in the section was like captain of the hockey team so it was like kind of funny to then cover him.

255
00:27:44,792 --> 00:28:02,528
As like an athlete and like a really good leader and a really good captain and then to see him like leading like the student section in crowd chance and everything else like, so it is fun that you are covering a lot of different perspectives of it because I think that stuff is funny I think high school kids are really funny I think that.

256
00:28:03,529 --> 00:28:08,892
We live in a world that everything is media, everything's online, everything's on the computer, everything's on your phone.

257
00:28:08,972 --> 00:28:17,738
And in this type of business, like I follow a certain sports website that's like high school sports and their best clips are from your phone.

258
00:28:17,778 --> 00:28:25,503
Like someone catching something on the sideline or somebody like just locker room coming out of the locker room and people are singing or dancing or whatever it is.

259
00:28:25,563 --> 00:28:28,605
And that's like the best, that's my favorite stuff on there.

260
00:28:28,645 --> 00:28:30,967
And I just feel like I'm in a business that

261
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:36,234
Like you can catch a lot of that with your phone and kids want to see it and.

262
00:28:37,296 --> 00:28:44,427
And so yeah so we know that we have these different avenues of high school sports with coaches and athletes and teams and programs that we can just go down and.

263
00:28:45,047 --> 00:28:46,508
We're taking our time doing it.

264
00:28:46,528 --> 00:28:52,754
We're not rushing it, but we know we have something that we can potentially just keep growing like a snowball down a hill.

265
00:28:52,834 --> 00:28:55,637
And so we'll see, hopefully this just keeps going.

266
00:28:56,017 --> 00:28:56,218
Yeah.

267
00:28:56,718 --> 00:28:57,078
It's funny.

268
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:58,160
You mentioned like social media.

269
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:02,343
I feel like I like, I'm like crazy about women's soccer, like the women's national team.

270
00:29:02,364 --> 00:29:08,009
I like fall like, and I, and I like find from following them on social media, I know like so much about them and their lives and like,

271
00:29:08,389 --> 00:29:19,632
their sport, but I makes me think about like my parent, my dad, like he can tell you like anything about football from like, and hockey from like whenever, but how, but he, what did he get that from reading the newspaper?

272
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,552
Like, I don't know.

273
00:29:21,632 --> 00:29:26,933
It's interesting to like, see how like, you know, that information, like the way that we source that information has changed.

274
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:27,774
I don't know.

275
00:29:28,314 --> 00:29:28,634
It's funny.

276
00:29:29,074 --> 00:29:29,874
Absolutely.

277
00:29:29,974 --> 00:29:35,295
And it's, it's just a whole, like, I never personally had social media until I did this podcast.

278
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,716
Like I never had it, you know, I just felt like.

279
00:29:38,937 --> 00:29:41,619
I don't need to be connected into the world.

280
00:29:41,639 --> 00:29:45,303
I work, I do my job, I'm a good person.

281
00:29:45,343 --> 00:29:50,267
And people have opinions and I try to always stay clear of that.

282
00:29:50,427 --> 00:29:55,692
And so with this, it's been a little harder because I need that platform to get what I need to get out there.

283
00:29:56,493 --> 00:30:03,739
But I've got such an education in Instagram over the last year of so many moments of like, wait, you can do that?

284
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,921
So many times, I'm like, wait, you can do that?

285
00:30:07,922 --> 00:30:15,426
And even last week, I figured out, when people put their stories, that my writing's always the same size.

286
00:30:15,687 --> 00:30:17,788
And I'm like, how do people shrink their writing?

287
00:30:17,828 --> 00:30:22,510
And I finally saw the thing onto the side, and I accidentally hit it, and I saw the writing get smaller.

288
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,432
I go, wait, that's how you do it?

289
00:30:24,492 --> 00:30:29,254
And then my first post last night was shrinking the writing and fitting so much more in there.

290
00:30:29,274 --> 00:30:30,635
I'm like, this is unbelievable.

291
00:30:31,476 --> 00:30:33,677
So I'm still very basic at it.

292
00:30:34,197 --> 00:30:53,380
But I'm learning how to look at my analytics and views and all that stuff and mathematically understand that, being like, okay, I understand this is what a first 24 hours looks like of a trailer I put out, or this is how many views we have in this many hours, this is how long someone's actually watching it or listening to it.

293
00:30:54,562 --> 00:31:04,218
It that stuff's fun like that's that's I'm learning a lot from that and I feel like the more I'm learning from that, like the better I'm kind of doing as far as.

294
00:31:04,717 --> 00:31:07,258
the outside stuff of like, okay, now I need to do this.

295
00:31:07,538 --> 00:31:07,878
Got it.

296
00:31:07,978 --> 00:31:08,618
You need to do this.

297
00:31:08,818 --> 00:31:09,158
Got it.

298
00:31:09,218 --> 00:31:11,899
Like it's helping me figure it out a little bit more.

299
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:13,700
You're coaching mind there.

300
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,780
I think it is.

301
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:23,603
I think it's that like X's and O's mind, you know, but it's like the only thing I know, you know, so it's kind of weird in that sense too.

302
00:31:23,623 --> 00:31:26,584
Cause when I was a coach, I loved watching film.

303
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:32,206
Like if you looked at my time watching film versus every other coach on the way, like on the site,

304
00:31:32,646 --> 00:31:55,841
It was like, it wasn't even close, you know, and because it was just, yeah, I'm just kind of mathematically analytically like very connected to that stuff I think that numbers don't lie with things and so, you know, seeing those numbers and then figuring out how to fix those numbers to completely different things but at least you have a direction that you're going right so that's how I look at this, you know.

305
00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:09,394
Yeah, well, and I think your story, you know, how you're describing sort of your trajectory here is like, I think it's helpful for other people to hear where like, you know, because I think, you know, so many kids when they play sports, they're like, I want to be professional, you know, they have these goals, right?

306
00:32:09,454 --> 00:32:18,777
And being able to think about how you can apply all these different sort of like ways of thinking and ways of organizing and like that discipline to anything you want, right?

307
00:32:18,797 --> 00:32:25,480
And you've listed like so many creative things and so many ways of connecting with other people and like, you know, providing

308
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:30,764
valuable resource that sounds like came out of that way of being and thinking.

309
00:32:30,804 --> 00:32:31,485
So it's cool.

310
00:32:31,725 --> 00:32:32,085
Yeah.

311
00:32:32,246 --> 00:32:35,709
And I think that that's, that's what's fun, right?

312
00:32:35,769 --> 00:32:47,600
Like, I feel like every little phase of every so often in my life, like I'm doing something different, or I'm following something different, or I'm passionate about something different.

313
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,521
But I feel like

314
00:32:49,657 --> 00:32:54,601
like high school sports and the coaching world, the athletic world, that's always kind of been consistent with me.

315
00:32:54,621 --> 00:32:59,885
And it's always been my balance of like schedule and like, maybe that's just how my life's been.

316
00:32:59,905 --> 00:33:03,308
I've always had school and then sports and then school and then sports.

317
00:33:03,468 --> 00:33:07,731
And like, I just learned to understand how to balance my academics with that.

318
00:33:07,891 --> 00:33:10,593
And then eventually like balance my life around it.

319
00:33:10,854 --> 00:33:16,258
And so I think when you get into like the real world of job and rent and,

320
00:33:16,758 --> 00:33:18,780
responsibility and discipline.

321
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:28,849
You've been doing it for so long that it doesn't really click to you until you're just handling things that maybe some kids your age have a lot of a hard time handling.

322
00:33:29,289 --> 00:33:37,596
And I felt like sports has always kind of had been my way of understanding what I needed to do versus what I wanted to do.

323
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:40,119
And that's important.

324
00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:41,920
Yeah, definitely.

325
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,922
That's awesome.

326
00:33:44,332 --> 00:33:47,834
Yeah, well, before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to make sure you mention?

327
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:49,155
No.

328
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:49,495
Yeah.

329
00:33:49,515 --> 00:33:51,716
I just want to say thank you for having me on.

330
00:33:51,916 --> 00:33:52,797
I'm really excited.

331
00:33:52,837 --> 00:33:57,900
I know having a podcast and how much work goes into it and scheduling.

332
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:01,402
And so I know everybody has busy lives and schedules.

333
00:34:01,422 --> 00:34:09,446
So I appreciate you kind of working with me and doing it a little bit later because I got to wait till bedtime.

334
00:34:12,628 --> 00:34:15,930
So, yeah, so I, I appreciate your flexibility with that.

335
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,691
And I think this is cool what you're doing.

336
00:34:17,751 --> 00:34:23,535
I know, um, you're really highlighting method, a place that I love and, you know, I teach and I grew up pretty much my whole life.

337
00:34:23,635 --> 00:34:32,960
So, you know, I wish you the best as you grow too, and, and, you know, go down the same road that I am as journey of podcasting and, um, yeah.

338
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,221
And great success to you.

339
00:34:34,581 --> 00:34:35,402
Oh, thank you so much.

00:34:35,462 --> 00:34:37,463

343

All right.
