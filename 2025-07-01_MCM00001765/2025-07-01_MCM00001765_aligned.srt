22
00:00:48,936 --> 00:00:51,399
Resolution in memory of Mr. William Shane Horty.

23
00:00:53,126 --> 00:01:02,130
Whereas the Medford City Council deeply mourns the passing of Mr. William Shane Horty, a lifelong resident of the city of Medford who passed away on March 10th, 2025 at the age of 70.

24
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:14,154
And whereas Mr. Horty was born August 3rd, 1954 in Vacaville, California, the beloved son of the late Charles L. and Carol L. Spencer Horty, and later made Medford his lifelong home.

25
00:01:14,614 --> 00:01:20,877
And whereas Shane graduated from Medford High School and went on to honorably serve his country as a member of the United States Marine Corps.

26
00:01:22,093 --> 00:01:30,235
And whereas Mr. Horty dedicated over 30 years of honorable and selfless service to the city of Medford as a firefighter, serving with courage, compassion, and unwavering commitment to public safety.

27
00:01:31,156 --> 00:01:40,758
And whereas Shane remained a proud and active member of the Medford Fire Department community long into his retirement, frequently visiting his former Engine 6 station and staying connected with his fellow firefighters.

28
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:46,620
And whereas Shane leaves behind a legacy of love, service, and deep-rooted community ties, survived by his loving wife,

29
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:58,102
Mary Kelly Horty, daughter Kelly M and her husband Chris J Jenke, granddaughter Casey K Jenke, sister Dawn Foley, brother Mark Horty and his wife Maureen and many nieces and nephews.

30
00:01:58,442 --> 00:02:10,805
Now therefore be it resolved that the Medford City Council formally extends its deepest sympathies to the family and loved ones of Mr. William Shane Horty and expresses his profound gratitude for his service, friendship and lasting impact on the City of Medford.

31
00:02:11,345 --> 00:02:17,529
and be it further resolved that a copy of this resolution be presented to the Horty family as a token of the City's respect and admiration.

32
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:18,990
Councillor Scarpelli.

33
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,391
Thank you, Mr. President.

34
00:02:20,491 --> 00:02:26,014
Firstly, I appreciate tabling this in my absence last week.

35
00:02:26,035 --> 00:02:28,176
Two weeks ago I was very sick and

36
00:02:28,973 --> 00:02:30,033
trying to get over right now.

37
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:36,916
So, um, I appreciate tabling it so I could share some kind words to the 40 family.

38
00:02:37,316 --> 00:02:48,121
Um, Shane was a remarkable individual, someone that, uh, um, worked hard for the city of Medford and saved many lives as a firefighter.

39
00:02:48,681 --> 00:02:52,303
He, uh, he worked to support his amazing family.

40
00:02:52,323 --> 00:02:53,343
I was, uh,

41
00:02:54,018 --> 00:03:01,482
former colleague of mine, his amazing wife, Mary, and his daughter, Kelly.

42
00:03:01,762 --> 00:03:05,044
And I know that leaves a huge void in that family.

43
00:03:06,585 --> 00:03:17,050
The Hortys were mainstays in our community for many, many years as custodians and teachers and firefighters, and he'll be missed.

44
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:20,552
And we send our condolences to the Horty family.

45
00:03:20,592 --> 00:03:21,633
So thank you, Mr. President.

46
00:03:23,097 --> 00:03:24,638
Thank you, Councillor Scarpelli.

47
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:33,903
On the motion of Councillor Scarpelli, seconded by Councillor Sang, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

48
00:03:37,265 --> 00:03:37,966
Councillor Callahan?

49
00:03:37,986 --> 00:03:38,146
Yes.

50
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:39,587
Vice President Collins?

51
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:41,488
Yes.

52
00:03:43,172 --> 00:03:43,993
Councilor Lazaro?

53
00:03:44,213 --> 00:03:44,393
Yes.

54
00:03:44,854 --> 00:03:45,755
Councilor Lemming is absent.

55
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:46,696
Councilor Scarpelli?

56
00:03:46,736 --> 00:03:46,976
Yes.

57
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:47,997
Councilor Sang?

58
00:03:48,277 --> 00:03:48,458
Yes.

59
00:03:48,758 --> 00:03:49,358
President Behrs?

60
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:49,759
Yes.

61
00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:51,521
Six in the affirmative, one absent.

62
00:03:51,561 --> 00:03:52,422
The motion passes.

63
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,803
Please rise for a moment of silence.

64
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:20,064
2-5-0-7-6 offered by President Bayer's resolution to recognize Food Allergy Awareness Week.

65
00:04:20,742 --> 00:04:25,626
Whereas more than 33 million Americans have food allergies, nearly 6 million are children under the age of 18.

66
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:30,269
Whereas research shows that the prevalence of the food allergy is increasing among children and adults.

67
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:39,255
Whereas nine foods cause the majority of all food allergy reactions in the United States, shellfish, fish, milk, eggs, tree nuts, peanuts, soy, wheat, and sesame.

68
00:04:40,076 --> 00:04:44,639
Food allergy reactions can range from mild symptoms to severe reactions such as anaphylaxis.

69
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,463
Whereas anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death.

70
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:58,909
Whereas every 10 seconds food allergy sends a patient to the emergency room, reactions typically occur when an individual unknowingly eats food containing an ingredient to which they are allergic.

71
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:04,393
Whereas emergency medical treatment for severe allergic reactions to food has increased by 377% in only a decade.

72
00:05:06,855 --> 00:05:34,178
whereas childhood food allergies cost US families $34 billion each year, whereas the Food Allergy Research and Education is a national non-profit organization dedicated to improving the quality of life and the health of individuals with food allergies, and to providing them hope through the promise of new treatments, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we recognize May 11th to 17th, 2025 as Food Allergy Awareness Week in the City of Medford, and that we encourage the residents of Medford to increase their understanding and awareness of food allergies and anaphylaxis.

73
00:05:34,778 --> 00:05:38,359
be it resolved that we request that the mayor issue a proclamation to the same effect.

74
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,781
And just to note, I believe the mayor did issue that proclamation.

75
00:05:45,062 --> 00:05:47,462
This was my item, just wanted to put it forward.

76
00:05:48,123 --> 00:05:57,206
That's an important issue and we often recognize different things, awareness weeks for different things here in this chamber.

77
00:05:57,386 --> 00:06:00,267
So the resolution otherwise speaks for itself.

78
00:06:00,287 --> 00:06:03,608
Does anyone else have anything they'd like to say on the matter?

79
00:06:07,908 --> 00:06:13,394
Is there a motion on the motion to approve by Councillor saying seconded by Councillor Callahan.

80
00:06:14,014 --> 00:06:15,096
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

00:06:45,694 --> 00:06:47,715

I haven't chaired it.

165
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:36,082
Or is it Councillor Scarpelli?

166
00:09:36,102 --> 00:09:37,242

and 25041, I believe, is on the public engagement strategy for the budget process.

177
00:10:25,842 --> 00:10:36,448
We sent out a Google survey for residents to be able to give their input to us about what they'd like to see in the city, this budget season, what they want to see long-term and how we can best engage them as well.

178
00:10:36,948 --> 00:10:38,749
I encourage all residents at home to

179
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:45,012
to fill out that form, and you can contact us if you have any trouble accessing it.

180
00:10:46,232 --> 00:10:48,873
We discussed preliminarily the results that we found.

181
00:10:49,173 --> 00:10:51,274
At the time of the meeting, we had about 92 results.

182

187
00:11:12,154 --> 00:11:14,818
Not sure if you knew this, but

188
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:40,477
Um, uh, I the public health and community safety meeting on May 7th was about the, um, uh, uh, the report from the Medford police chief on body worn cameras, which is a required yearly report.

Thank you.

216
00:13:01,021 --> 00:13:18,175
One of the things that we do monthly as part of our resident services and public engagement activities is we hold monthly listening sessions and other less consistent listening sessions.

217
00:13:19,016 --> 00:13:21,498
We hold monthly sessions at the senior center.

218
00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:27,984
and we hold other sessions in various places with different groups around the city.

219
00:13:28,525 --> 00:13:46,440
And when we were hearing from the departments about their budgets, we heard from the director of the Veterans Services Department, and she spoke about Veterans Coffee and Cookies Hour.

220
00:13:47,943 --> 00:14:01,354
and it was mentioned that it might be a good opportunity for a counselor to join this event as a listening session, and I thought I would offer it here so that we can

221
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,789
to send it to the resident services committee.

222
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:14,660
This is sort of a formality, but also just a good opportunity for me to remind everybody that we do host those listening sessions at the senior center.

223
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,564
I'll be there on May 29th at 12 o'clock noon.

226
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:22,310
community.

227
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,951
It's a great opportunity to connect with our Medford seniors and people who will already be at the senior center.

228
00:14:26,671 --> 00:14:35,393
But it's always the fourth Thursday of the month with a rotating member of the Resident Services Committee, and it's a great opportunity to connect with.

229
00:14:36,533 --> 00:14:41,715
Um the City Council and tell us what you're noticing and thinking about the city.

230
00:14:41,935 --> 00:14:45,235

And I if I may also remind people not just that we have the senior center ones, but that we do listening sessions.

239
00:15:10,348 --> 00:15:18,772
So I want people to understand that we do listening sessions and for folks, you know who maybe do not come to City Council meetings.

240
00:15:19,172 --> 00:15:19,312
Um.

241
00:15:19,332 --> 00:15:22,754
You know, the purpose is really to hear from folks who are not coming here.

242
00:15:23,474 --> 00:15:25,115

00:15:30,739 --> 00:15:32,421

I know there's some confusion, but... It's no longer a special permit.

341
00:20:43,066 --> 00:20:43,486
Right, right.

342
00:20:43,506 --> 00:20:44,446
Just so it has to come back.

343
00:20:44,546 --> 00:20:45,067
Okay, thank you.

344
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,135
Is the petition again, Mr. President?

345
00:20:48,155 --> 00:20:48,776
I don't see them.

346
00:20:48,876 --> 00:20:55,402
Could you raise your hand on Zoom, Matthew Greer, or a representative for the establishment?

347
00:21:00,026 --> 00:21:01,908
They were in last week at the office.

348
00:21:03,249 --> 00:21:04,350
Yeah, I'm not seeing them present.

349
00:21:05,892 --> 00:21:10,474
I mean, to be honest with you, I think that, I mean, we could wait for them next week, but I think that's just preliminary.

350
00:21:10,514 --> 00:21:16,037
I think that you're seeing one o'clock as a, as a normal where the establishment is located.

351
00:21:16,057 --> 00:21:20,379
It's a, it falls outside the range of the neighborhood.

352
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:22,720
So in a sense, traditional neighborhood.

353
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,582
Um, so I know that we've extended permits to one o'clock, but

354
00:21:29,483 --> 00:21:31,063
for multiple locations.

355
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:38,506
Now this council has taken a stance on open up different establishments till one o'clock all over the community.

356
00:21:38,566 --> 00:21:50,909
So I think we, as I said in the past about keeping things consistent, I would recommend to award this, these hours with a 30, 60, 90 day review.

357
00:21:54,715 --> 00:21:55,535
All right.

358
00:21:55,875 --> 00:22:01,276
On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to approve with a 30, 60, 90 day review, seconded by Councilor Zaro.

359
00:22:01,296 --> 00:22:05,917
Is there anyone else who'd like to speak on this?

360
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:07,117
Any objections or discussion?

361
00:22:09,378 --> 00:22:12,779
Seeing none, on the motion as seconded, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

362
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:17,099
Councilor Callahan.

363
00:22:17,399 --> 00:22:17,539
Yes.

364
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,340
Vice President Collins.

365
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:19,860
Yes.

366
00:22:21,327 --> 00:22:22,167
Councilor Zaro.

367
00:22:23,168 --> 00:22:24,208
Councilor Lemming is absent.

368
00:22:24,348 --> 00:22:25,128
Councilor Scarpelli.

369
00:22:25,868 --> 00:22:26,428
Councilor Seng.

370
00:22:26,949 --> 00:22:27,609
President Ferris.

371
00:22:27,829 --> 00:22:28,089
Yes.

372
00:22:28,729 --> 00:22:29,729
Six affirmative, one absent.

373
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:30,610
The motion passes.

374
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,570
Motions, orders and resolutions.

375
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:38,412
24069 offered by Councilor Seng, amendment to the human rights commission, enabling ordinance.

376
00:22:41,433 --> 00:22:49,935
Is there a motion to waive the reading in favor of a summary by the proponent on the motion of Councilor Seng to waive the reading seconded by?

377
00:22:50,988 --> 00:22:53,153
seconded by Councilor Zaro.

378
00:22:54,276 --> 00:22:55,038
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

379
00:23:14,466 --> 00:23:15,147
Councilor Callahan.

380
00:23:15,468 --> 00:23:15,968
Yes.

381
00:23:15,988 --> 00:23:16,850
Vice President Collins.

382
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:17,410
Yes.

383
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:19,614
Councilor Lazaro.

384
00:23:19,814 --> 00:23:19,914
Yes.

385
00:23:20,255 --> 00:23:21,176
Councilor Lemming is absent.

386
00:23:21,256 --> 00:23:21,857
Councilor Scarpelli.

387
00:23:21,877 --> 00:23:21,957
Yes.

388
00:23:22,878 --> 00:23:23,439
Councilor Sang.

389
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:23,800
Yes.

390
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:24,601
President Behrs.

391
00:23:24,621 --> 00:23:24,821
Yes.

392
00:23:24,881 --> 00:23:25,903
Six in the affirmative, one absent.

393
00:23:25,923 --> 00:23:26,624
The motion passes.

394
00:23:26,644 --> 00:23:27,225
Councilor Sang.

395
00:23:28,276 --> 00:23:28,676
Thank you.

396
00:23:29,217 --> 00:23:40,502
At a moment where I think a lot of residents are scared, concerned, afraid about their human rights, civil rights of their own and their neighbors.

397
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:48,427
I think it becomes incumbent upon us as elected officials to do the most that we can to safeguard those rights here in our community.

398
00:23:48,447 --> 00:23:49,027
I think

399
00:23:49,567 --> 00:24:00,209
The city council has repeatedly shown over the last, especially over the last few months, but in the last few years too, that we stand on the side of human rights.

400
00:24:01,349 --> 00:24:15,772
And we stand on the side of our city being more proactive in reaching out to residents to let them know about their rights, proactive about solving inequalities and disparities in our community, and to do better in general.

401
00:24:17,813 --> 00:24:35,832
This effort, this particular effort, came about over a year ago, if not two years ago, with members, former members of the Human Rights Commission who, you know, reached out to me and let me know how the existing ordinance, the one that we have right now, is quite outdated.

402
00:24:36,773 --> 00:24:44,660
and has led to a lot of problems where the HRC can't do what HRCs normally do in surrounding communities as well.

403
00:24:44,841 --> 00:24:59,055
And a lot of these are basic functions that we really think that we would conceive of the Human Rights Commission doing, like hosting events and letting residents know about their rights, stuff like that.

404
00:25:00,475 --> 00:25:06,138
and as well as creating recommendations and studying data that we collect in the city.

405
00:25:07,979 --> 00:25:16,543
In this day and age, I think it becomes important for us to act on that and to fix those problems that we've seen in that old ordinance.

406
00:25:17,203 --> 00:25:26,727
And I'm so grateful to the hard work of a lot of our residents, a few of whom are here in the audience tonight, but I know a lot of folks at home are also watching this meeting.

407
00:25:28,468 --> 00:25:37,372
who, and you know, this group of residents came together and we all worked together on a draft ordinance to update the HRC to make it fit for modern times.

408
00:25:38,432 --> 00:25:45,055
And I'm, you know, so thankful and grateful for their hard work because I know it was the labor of love.

409
00:25:46,135 --> 00:25:56,580
We've been spending a lot of time on this over the last few months, reaching out to our DEI director, to the mayoral administration, to different stakeholders, making sure that we have something that

410
00:25:58,122 --> 00:26:00,623
is ambitious and actionable.

411
00:26:01,704 --> 00:26:04,945
So that's what I want to say about this.

412
00:26:05,546 --> 00:26:16,031
In essence, this ordinance update reestablishes the Human Rights Commission and re-empowers it to do even more and to be even more proactive in serving our city.

413
00:26:17,311 --> 00:26:17,911
I know a lot of

414
00:26:20,818 --> 00:26:28,866
people who are even currently on the HRC have been pushing for this because the HRC is currently pretty defunct.

415
00:26:29,867 --> 00:26:33,771
And so I'm excited for the City Council to finally be voting on this tonight.

416
00:26:34,212 --> 00:26:40,078
There are some small technical amendments for the most part that I would make a motion

417
00:26:43,017 --> 00:26:43,617
to adopt.

418
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:47,338
And Mr. Clerk, I'll send these to you via email as well.

419
00:26:48,258 --> 00:26:59,501
But in section 50-62, because we changed the committee composition for the kind of the staggered terms at the very start, we just need to fix the language there.

420
00:26:59,981 --> 00:27:04,102
So instead of a third of members shall serve for one year term, a third, a third.

421
00:27:05,763 --> 00:27:09,265
I would amend that to read two members shall serve for one year term.

422
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:13,048
Three members shall serve for two year term and three members shall serve for three year term.

423
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:16,891
So that's the first amendment.

424
00:27:17,211 --> 00:27:24,956
The second amendment would be to strike the words administration in the public school system after the word city in section 50-66 in subsection B.

425
00:27:27,752 --> 00:27:32,836
And that would be in section 55-66.

426
00:27:34,658 --> 00:27:46,667
And then the third edit would be also in section 50-66 to strike subsection D2 and to renumber the subsections.

427
00:27:47,348 --> 00:27:50,070
That last edit is a little bit more substantive

428
00:27:51,052 --> 00:27:52,353
It's still mostly technical.

429
00:27:52,373 --> 00:28:00,020
That was upon request of the school committee who said that the DSE reporting isn't necessarily a complete picture of what we have at the schools.

430
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,483
And so we shouldn't put it in the ordinance.

431
00:28:03,643 --> 00:28:04,624
So D2?

432
00:28:04,764 --> 00:28:05,184
D2.

433
00:28:05,405 --> 00:28:05,665
Yeah.

434
00:28:05,965 --> 00:28:10,509
And then what was the language strike in 5626B1?

435
00:28:10,929 --> 00:28:15,934
Yeah, in B1, just to strike the words administration and public school system.

436
00:28:16,134 --> 00:28:16,894
Just leave that.

437
00:28:16,994 --> 00:28:17,835
Advise the city.

438
00:28:17,895 --> 00:28:18,135
Got it.

439
00:28:20,926 --> 00:28:22,907
I just have one question on your amendment.

440
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:23,628
Yes.

441
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:26,050
In 62, it says there's 11 members.

442
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:26,750
Yes.

443
00:28:26,931 --> 00:28:30,654
And then you named eight for the staggered terms.

444
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:32,195
My math.

445
00:28:33,216 --> 00:28:34,657
I think my math is off.

446
00:28:35,137 --> 00:28:35,758
Sorry.

447
00:28:36,118 --> 00:28:37,039
I meant to say three, four, four.

448
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:37,859
Three, four, four.

449
00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:38,260
All right.

450
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,081
All right.

451
00:28:40,181 --> 00:28:43,324
Just make sure that gets corrected when we send it to the clerk as well.

452
00:28:43,884 --> 00:28:47,707
I'm glad that I can always count on Councillor Behrs to check my math one more time.

453
00:28:48,068 --> 00:28:48,388
Oh, yeah.

454
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:56,371
All right, and on the process, this was in resident services?

455
00:28:56,511 --> 00:28:57,851
Yes, this is in resident services.

456
00:28:58,091 --> 00:28:59,292
And how many meetings did you have on it?

457
00:28:59,432 --> 00:29:04,873
We had quite a lot, few, we had five at least, five meetings on this, five or six.

458
00:29:05,253 --> 00:29:06,113
Great, thank you.

459
00:29:07,053 --> 00:29:14,114
So on the motion of councilor saying to approve for first reading as amended, seconded by councilor Lazaro.

460
00:29:14,134 --> 00:29:16,215
Any further discussions by members of the council?

461
00:29:17,235 --> 00:29:18,275
Councilor Lazaro.

462
00:29:19,722 --> 00:29:27,923
I'd like to thank Councillor saying for his careful work on this project and thank the members of the current and former of the, um.

463
00:29:29,824 --> 00:29:31,124
The committee, the commission.

464
00:29:31,804 --> 00:29:35,365
Um and just everybody who put work into this project.

465
00:29:35,445 --> 00:29:38,445
It's been, um.

466
00:29:38,505 --> 00:29:42,866
Careful process, and I appreciate everybody putting in the separate because it's an

467
00:29:49,985 --> 00:29:57,226
to be a part of it, and I am eager to move it to the next step so it can be the best governing document that it can be.

468
00:29:57,566 --> 00:29:57,886
Thank you.

469
00:29:59,467 --> 00:30:00,007
Thank you.

470
00:30:00,027 --> 00:30:03,127
Counselor saying just one other question.

471
00:30:03,147 --> 00:30:06,628
Did we strike all of 52 or just okay?

472
00:30:08,088 --> 00:30:10,529
Um Great.

473
00:30:12,289 --> 00:30:14,249
And could you in addition to sending the amendments?

474
00:30:14,269 --> 00:30:16,790
Can you send a clean copy in a word document?

475
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:17,330
Thank you.

476
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,470
Just for the advertising.

477
00:30:19,728 --> 00:30:23,129
Any further discussion by members of the council on the motion?

478
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:32,212
Seeing none, we will go to any discussion by members of the public, either in person or on Zoom.

479
00:30:32,232 --> 00:30:37,974
You can come to the podium in person or raise your hand on Zoom, and you'll have three minutes.

480
00:30:38,274 --> 00:30:42,275
I see on Zoom, we have Munir.

481
00:30:42,315 --> 00:30:43,775
Give me one moment.

482
00:30:47,116 --> 00:30:48,877
I've changed Zoom on me again.

483
00:30:56,385 --> 00:31:01,932
All right, I'm going to recognize you and please name and address for the record and you'll have three minutes.

484
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:09,841
Thank you.

485
00:31:09,881 --> 00:31:10,982
Excuse me.

486
00:31:12,184 --> 00:31:13,465
My name is Munir Jamaris.

487
00:31:13,786 --> 00:31:15,368
I live at 3 Summit Road.

488
00:31:16,557 --> 00:31:28,625
And very briefly, I served for several years at the HRC between 2017 and 2022, and served as chair for four years.

489
00:31:32,187 --> 00:31:40,795
And in the fall of 2021, so several years ago, the HRC formed a subcommittee to generate a strategic plan for better definition of the role of the HRC.

490
00:31:41,416 --> 00:31:52,526
Since, as Councilor Tsang mentioned, the existing ordinance was outdated and it did not fully describe the role and responsibilities of the HRC.

491
00:31:53,771 --> 00:32:09,483
And very quickly soon after that, the HRC decided to disband this committee and accepted an offer from Safe Medford to establish an ad hoc committee to assess the effectiveness of the HRC and to provide recommendations.

492
00:32:09,663 --> 00:32:14,447
This committee included three HRC members along with several Safe Medford members.

493
00:32:15,288 --> 00:32:17,930
The committee conducted several dozen interviews

494
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:30,539
of current and past HRC stakeholders and surveyed the missions, goals and activities of human rights commissions in nearby cities and towns and also reviewed the ordinance that established the Medford HRC.

495
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:41,368
Next, the subcommittee discussed and agreed upon a set of recommendations regarding the goals and roles of the HRC and operating guidelines for their implementation.

496
00:32:42,630 --> 00:33:00,792
And in the course of this work and discussions, the committee concluded that to a significant extent, the HRC has been hampered by its current enabling ordinance, which was outdated, and it would need to carry out the mandate that the order defines.

497
00:33:01,733 --> 00:33:18,160
After presenting the recommendations of this committee to the HRC, the committee recommended that a new ordinance be generated clearly outlining the HRC's compositions, roles, and responsibilities, providing the HRC with independence and resources to fulfill those responsibilities.

498
00:33:18,978 --> 00:33:29,585
Subsequently, another group that included two previous HRC chairs, the previous DEI director, and several folks in Medford.

499
00:33:30,105 --> 00:33:38,770
We worked with Councillor Tsang, for whom we are really very grateful, and we worked to offer such an ordinance, which is now under consideration.

500
00:33:39,491 --> 00:33:45,935
I urge the city council to adopt this ordinance with the edits that were made after discussion with the city administration.

501
00:33:46,295 --> 00:33:46,615
Thank you.

502
00:33:48,102 --> 00:33:48,723
Thank you, Muneer.

503
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:56,250
We will go now to the podium.

504
00:33:57,632 --> 00:33:58,953
Name and address for the record, please.

505
00:33:58,973 --> 00:34:00,014
And you'll have three minutes.

506
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:00,615
Sure.

507
00:34:01,076 --> 00:34:01,976
Micah Kesselman.

508
00:34:02,057 --> 00:34:03,278
I'm at 499 Main Street.

509
00:34:04,938 --> 00:34:06,599
First, thank you, Councilor Sang, for bringing this.

510
00:34:06,619 --> 00:34:16,181
This is actually a great ordinance to bring, and it's timely, and I'm actually super excited to see it.

511
00:34:16,201 --> 00:34:21,602
I was not expecting it when I came, decided to come to the session today.

512
00:34:22,483 --> 00:34:28,144
So I do have some questions, though, that I would like some

513
00:34:29,141 --> 00:34:30,302
clarification on, I think.

514
00:34:30,923 --> 00:34:46,997
It seems like the data that is being written into this and being received from various departments is pretty limited in scope.

515
00:34:47,557 --> 00:34:55,865
And in particular, I mean, I think, you know, especially right now with what's going on in the world, police activity and its impact on

516
00:34:56,735 --> 00:35:07,487
our residents' rights, their fundamental rights, is extremely important to investigate and inspect and see what we can do to make sure that everything is as above board as possible.

517
00:35:08,788 --> 00:35:16,617
But as this is written, the only data that you really have that you get from the police are basically police stop activity.

518
00:35:17,317 --> 00:35:18,659
And I am just

519
00:35:19,573 --> 00:35:21,514
Like, is there a reason that it's not broader than that?

520
00:35:21,574 --> 00:35:25,555
Like, why can't we just have a broad scope, broad net?

521
00:35:25,975 --> 00:35:44,502
The police have to, the Medford Police Department has to provide activity data over, you know, however many last few months or something on a regular basis, because I think that would go a lot further in enabling this committee to actually craft laws and policies to advise the council on.

522
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:49,579
Any other questions, or is that the main question?

523
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,361
No, that's the main one.

524
00:35:52,481 --> 00:35:54,282
All right, good job.

525
00:35:55,002 --> 00:35:56,463
That's my other question, thanks.

526
00:35:57,184 --> 00:35:57,944
Thank you, great.

527
00:35:58,144 --> 00:35:59,265
I'll recognize Councillor Strang.

528
00:35:59,845 --> 00:36:01,086
I appreciate the compliment.

529
00:36:01,386 --> 00:36:04,408
Through the chair, I think that's an excellent question.

530
00:36:06,069 --> 00:36:14,154
So essentially the data that is listed out here are things that we know slash historically know the city has collected.

531
00:36:14,174 --> 00:36:16,556
A lot of the data is,

532
00:36:17,336 --> 00:36:33,430
that honestly one of the problems with these types of issues in municipal governance is that we don't have a lot of the data we really should be having, which is why there's a whole section on requesting that the city council and the city administration collect data.

533
00:36:34,411 --> 00:36:41,237
Of course, I think it's just we could create a whole list and we just wanted something from

534
00:36:42,234 --> 00:36:49,840
different, you know, we wanted examples of data points that each department could collect or relevant departments could collect.

535
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:58,588
Police stops is the main thing that we know, at least, we know that the MPD does collect.

536
00:36:59,408 --> 00:37:03,849
and that we have used in the past to analyze disparities.

537
00:37:04,709 --> 00:37:26,333
I do hear your point, which is why in front of every list, we've made sure to add that, you know, these points, these data points are like minimum requirements, or, you know, at minimum, we can, the HRC can request XYZ, or at minimum, departments should collect XYZ and report XYZ.

538
00:37:28,493 --> 00:37:34,056
So all that's to say that what the lists that we're referring to right now, they're non-exhaustive.

539
00:37:35,016 --> 00:37:38,958
They're just a starting point for the HRC to be able to work on in the future.

540
00:37:39,979 --> 00:37:42,460
I think there is also a lot of worry.

541
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:51,865
There would be a lot of worry from the administration, at least from an executive viewpoint of an ordinance asking them to collect data that

542
00:37:53,513 --> 00:37:54,955
isn't currently being collected.

543
00:37:54,995 --> 00:38:04,124
I think that would create some consternation in the corner office, which is why part of the negotiating process was to have data that

544
00:38:05,572 --> 00:38:11,196
or to have these categories that we thought were implementable.

545
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:17,720
I also know that a lot of this comes from the basis of this version of the HRC ordinance.

546
00:38:18,201 --> 00:38:22,604
It's kind of like a collection of different HRC ordinances from different municipalities as well.

547
00:38:23,004 --> 00:38:28,708
So a lot of this is based on what other municipalities HRCs are collecting and reporting on.

548
00:38:31,167 --> 00:38:31,968
That was the long answer.

549
00:38:32,068 --> 00:38:36,312
I think the short answer, the short answer is this isn't an exhaustive list.

550
00:38:37,473 --> 00:38:38,795
The HRC can request that.

551
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:42,218
That's more data from the police department.

552
00:38:42,759 --> 00:38:44,080
That's within their powers here.

553
00:38:46,062 --> 00:38:54,771
And we just kind of put into the ordinance data that we know the city is slash has historically collected.

554
00:38:59,618 --> 00:39:03,560
I recognize you for well, actually, I have to go back to Jennifer and then we'll come back to you.

555
00:39:05,181 --> 00:39:08,063
Jennifer, name and address record of three minutes.

556
00:39:09,864 --> 00:39:10,984
My name is Jennifer Yanko.

557
00:39:11,004 --> 00:39:12,805
I live at 16 Monument Street.

558
00:39:13,466 --> 00:39:16,688
And just in reference to this comment,

559
00:39:17,714 --> 00:39:20,097
There is state data that's available.

560
00:39:20,137 --> 00:39:23,401
I mean, arrests by race is freely available.

561
00:39:23,721 --> 00:39:26,244
So there's other data sources that can be used.

562
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:32,933
That said, I just want to commend the council on

563
00:39:33,713 --> 00:39:54,364
you know, hearing this ordinance, I think it's so important, as Councilor Tseng has said, right now, we're in a place where our human rights and our civil rights are really under threat, and it's extremely important, I think, that we have an active, effective Human Rights Commission.

564
00:39:55,905 --> 00:40:01,789
and I think this ordinance is very comprehensive.

565
00:40:02,329 --> 00:40:13,598
I did want to raise one concern, and that has to do with, let's see, I think this is 5065B.

566
00:40:15,219 --> 00:40:21,784
We talked about having the resources to do the work that it would be called upon to do.

567
00:40:22,525 --> 00:40:28,000
And for as far as we know, I say we as one of the people who's been working on

568
00:40:29,065 --> 00:40:30,725
the original recommendations.

569
00:40:32,326 --> 00:40:36,447
Boards and commissions in the city of Medford do have a staff person assigned to them.

570
00:40:36,787 --> 00:40:54,831
You know, it could be a full-time, a part-time, an intern, but someone who is charged with sort of doing some of the clerical work that's involved, distributing agendas, making copies, and particularly all new members

571
00:40:55,689 --> 00:41:00,350
of the HRC will need to have training in running meetings and so on.

572
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:17,795
And so someone who could organize that as well as keep up with the routine clerical and administrative tasks that are associated with the HRC, I think that will really empower the HRC to do a much better job.

573
00:41:17,835 --> 00:41:20,216
So I urge that section, again,

574
00:41:25,799 --> 00:41:35,301
50 60.

575
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:35,301
50 65 B, where it says the mayor shall assign a qualified city employee or city council liaison.

576
00:41:35,341 --> 00:41:51,345
I would ask you to consider striking or city council liaison to provide staffing support to the commission because I think it's a significant task, and it would be good to have someone who is, you know, assigned and who has the time

577
00:41:51,944 --> 00:41:53,326
and who is hired to do that.

578
00:41:54,167 --> 00:41:59,833
So that was my one comment, but again, I'm really excited about this ordinance and thank you for considering it.

579
00:42:01,195 --> 00:42:01,656
Thank you.

580
00:42:01,676 --> 00:42:05,500
I gotta go jump over you to Gaston and then come back to you.

581
00:42:07,062 --> 00:42:09,084
Gaston, name and address for the record.

582
00:42:10,106 --> 00:42:10,907
You have three minutes.

583
00:42:12,218 --> 00:42:15,221
Thank you very much, Mr President.

584
00:42:16,102 --> 00:42:19,105
I support the spirit of the Human Rights Commission.

585
00:42:19,765 --> 00:42:29,535
I have reservations about some specific sentences, so let me proceed to just quote excerpts and ask a few questions about it.

586
00:42:30,976 --> 00:42:43,844
So the first one, in section 5062B, quote, appointments shall be made to ensure that no more than 60% of membership are of any one race or racial identity, end quote.

587
00:42:45,118 --> 00:42:48,640
This rule is imposing a quota based on race or gender.

588
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:54,864
How isn't a quota based on race or gender completely against the purposes of the Human Rights Commission?

589
00:42:55,624 --> 00:42:58,686
How isn't a quota based on race or gender plainly illegal?

590
00:42:59,386 --> 00:43:00,867
So let me give you an example.

591
00:43:00,887 --> 00:43:01,548
So let's say that

592
00:43:02,428 --> 00:43:11,752
the commission already has 60% of its membership composed of Hispanics, Latinos, and I would like to get into the commission.

593
00:43:12,372 --> 00:43:21,876
Then that means that because we're already at the cap of 60%, then I will be immediately disqualified just based on my racial identity.

594
00:43:23,208 --> 00:43:34,485
So the second one, section 5066B3, quote, request periodic annual reports from the city administration detailing employment diversity efforts, end quote.

595
00:43:35,575 --> 00:43:49,739
So my question is, how do we ensure that the employment diversity data is used to check that applicants were hired based on having been the most qualified for a job and not discriminated against based on the enumerations in Section 5061C?

596
00:43:49,779 --> 00:43:52,459
So that's the correct thing.

597
00:43:52,899 --> 00:44:02,642
Instead of using the enumerations in Section 5061C to give some applicants extra consideration beyond their qualifications for the job.

598
00:44:03,802 --> 00:44:19,290
And the last one, it's also section 5066C, quote, the MHRC shall also exert its moral authority on the full range of laws, practices and policies that might have an impact of human rights, end quote.

599
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:25,656
Where's the definition of what's moral and what's immoral?

600
00:44:25,817 --> 00:44:30,259
The above gives wide, undefined power to the commission.

601
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:37,804
And there are several examples throughout history where governments have committed atrocious human rights violations based on moral authority.

602
00:44:38,745 --> 00:44:39,986
So those are just my questions.

603
00:44:41,467 --> 00:44:45,470
As I said, I support this Human Rights Commission spirit.

604
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:52,453
But I would like to get some answers on my questions.

605
00:44:52,494 --> 00:44:52,914
Thanks so much.

606
00:44:52,934 --> 00:44:53,534
I appreciate that.

607
00:44:53,654 --> 00:44:54,395
And thank you for your job.

608
00:44:54,495 --> 00:44:54,775
Thank you.

609
00:44:55,035 --> 00:44:55,515
Thank you.

610
00:44:55,535 --> 00:45:01,799
And we'll go back for a minute, and then we'll, Justin, I hope, is writing everything down, and we'll answer all the questions.

611
00:45:08,492 --> 00:45:12,575
The Medford Police Department must collect more data than just police stops.

612
00:45:12,655 --> 00:45:25,225
And I understand that we can get arrest data from state sources and everything, but I mean, I just don't see why it can't just be like a broad net of like get data from them, like whatever they have.

613
00:45:25,605 --> 00:45:33,471
I mean, if they have records, they have data provided to the HRC council as an oversight board that makes sure that they're not violating any people's rights.

614
00:45:36,473 --> 00:45:39,675
It can always be fixed later.

615
00:45:39,735 --> 00:45:56,930
But the thing is, I don't see in this any requirements on the sources of data to actually provide it within a timely manner.

616
00:45:57,513 --> 00:46:17,986
I don't know if that's maybe just because there isn't, for legal reasons, went through a review and that just isn't able to be put in here, but it would be, if possible, saying if you request data from the MPD, you request data from the housing authority, they must provide it within 30 days of the request or something like that.

617
00:46:18,086 --> 00:46:26,032
Give some sort of timeline so that there's an enforcement mechanism to say when they have, by the black letter of what's in the ordinance,

618
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:28,626
are in violation of it.

619
00:46:29,586 --> 00:46:39,631
Otherwise, you're setting yourself up to run into situations where you're gonna have malicious compliance or just straight up non-compliance because there's no reason for them to comply.

620
00:46:39,651 --> 00:46:43,853
Those are a couple of my other sort of comments on that.

621
00:46:44,213 --> 00:46:44,693
Thank you.

622
00:46:44,713 --> 00:46:49,235
I'm gonna go to Barry and then I'll go to- Barry, three minutes.

623
00:46:55,363 --> 00:46:57,143
Maryburn 9 Dreamer Street.

624
00:46:57,824 --> 00:47:00,124
Thank you all for taking this up.

625
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:03,485
Thank you, Councilor Tsang for leading the charge on it.

626
00:47:04,865 --> 00:47:17,448
I would like to just restate every word that Jennifer Yanko has said, but I also want to bring up one, including her concern about having an assigned staff person.

627
00:47:17,468 --> 00:47:20,069
I also want to

628
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:24,463
ask a question, which I think is a concern.

629
00:47:24,543 --> 00:47:35,375
If I heard Councilor Tsang's amendments correctly, he was suggesting excising section 5066, number two.

630
00:47:38,892 --> 00:47:40,754
Is that correct?

631
00:47:41,354 --> 00:47:42,455
56D6D.

632
00:47:42,775 --> 00:47:43,796
66B, number two.

633
00:47:44,176 --> 00:47:54,445
D2, so under research and reporting educational data such as school discipline rates and dropout rates from the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education metrics on IEPs.

634
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:56,170
Oh, I don't know.

635
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:57,370
I don't see that on here.

636
00:47:57,430 --> 00:47:58,631
It's d two.

637
00:47:58,691 --> 00:48:00,451
It's 11 page further.

638
00:48:01,191 --> 00:48:01,571
So it wasn't.

639
00:48:02,191 --> 00:48:03,932
It wasn't B to the period.

640
00:48:04,152 --> 00:48:05,692
Okay, so it was not be too.

641
00:48:05,832 --> 00:48:06,132
Okay.

642
00:48:06,252 --> 00:48:08,132
And what was the other change?

643
00:48:08,192 --> 00:48:09,853
I was not able to hear that.

644
00:48:10,213 --> 00:48:13,413
2 50 66 be the main section.

645
00:48:13,973 --> 00:48:18,214
Instead of reading the city administration on the public school system, it would just read the city.

646
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:22,595
Okay, that's fine.

647
00:48:23,617 --> 00:48:27,398
I just want to state my support for this ordinance.

648
00:48:27,478 --> 00:48:28,319
Thank you very much.

649
00:48:28,479 --> 00:48:29,779
Thanks very much.

650
00:48:29,819 --> 00:48:32,420
Councilor Sang on the questions.

651
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:34,201
Thank you.

652
00:48:36,521 --> 00:48:38,942
There's a lot, so I'll take it one by one.

653
00:48:40,383 --> 00:48:52,947
On the data from police departments, the authorities, I would support, you know, inserting a sentence in there.

654
00:48:53,995 --> 00:48:56,818
to request timely information.

655
00:48:57,419 --> 00:49:14,738
I think the reason why we didn't is because there's not a neat place to put it where some of the data that's under requests is more about requests rather than, it is more about data that we don't, we might not currently have

656
00:49:15,591 --> 00:49:17,372
mixed in with data that we know we have.

657
00:49:17,452 --> 00:49:19,434
So it becomes a little bit complex.

658
00:49:21,035 --> 00:49:34,123
But I do think under research and reporting, we can put in a sentence that reads requested data shall be provided by the city administration in a timely manner.

659
00:49:35,124 --> 00:49:35,985
I think that's reasonable.

660
00:49:37,085 --> 00:49:38,526
I would add that to the amendments.

661
00:49:41,301 --> 00:49:57,010
Um, I did also your comment also did, um, remind me to add in that the, um, the list indeed, um, subsection D shall also not should also not be, um, exhaustive as well.

662
00:49:57,891 --> 00:50:00,853
Um, so I think that's a good catch.

663
00:50:01,013 --> 00:50:01,433
Thank you.

664
00:50:02,053 --> 00:50:04,055
Um, I will say that, um,

665
00:50:05,495 --> 00:50:11,102
I'll have to, you know, the mayor's office will also have to sign off on this on this ordinance as well.

666
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:17,730
So I would suggest reaching out to her office because her office is the one that will execute this ordinance.

667
00:50:19,275 --> 00:50:32,561
On the second resident's concerns about the city staff person slash liaison situation, this is something we talked about in committee as well.

668
00:50:34,282 --> 00:50:41,125
So essentially in committee, we discussed how currently there is no assigned city staff person to the HRC.

669
00:50:41,425 --> 00:50:46,347
Historically, it's been the DAI director, but the DAI director has said that she won't.

670
00:50:47,027 --> 00:50:49,049
be the liaison to the HRC.

671
00:50:51,831 --> 00:50:57,936
And so then it becomes, you know, it falls upon the mayor to decide who else will do it.

672
00:50:59,317 --> 00:51:01,359
That's something I'm working with the mayor on currently.

673
00:51:02,419 --> 00:51:12,988
And with the kind of people that we, the city staff that we have traditionally kind of thought of to be well suited for this role, no one has, you know,

674
00:51:13,863 --> 00:51:33,137
no one has offered and no one has said yes to it, which is why part of through conversations with the mayor's office and with DEI office, we put in the words or city council liaison were relevant to give us the most flexibility to make sure that we can at the very least get this off the ground.

675
00:51:33,377 --> 00:51:39,902
And maybe once it's off the ground and up and running, we can get a city staff person to do that.

676
00:51:40,822 --> 00:51:49,588
I suspect this is also something that the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee is gonna keep working on in the future as well to make sure that we do have the assigned city staff person.

677
00:51:49,648 --> 00:52:09,580
But I would say that we shouldn't strike the words that were suggested to be struck just in order to make sure that we give ourselves the most flexibility going forward with getting this new HRC up and off the ground.

678
00:52:10,731 --> 00:52:12,615
With regards to the section 50-62B,

679
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:32,659
I believe that most of us can agree that the role of a human rights commission necessitates diversity on that commission.

680
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:45,230
We actually raised the bar from 50% to 60% to ensure that we have that flexibility to make sure that we have the best qualified residents joining.

681
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:49,093
But in this case, qualification

682
00:52:49,971 --> 00:52:52,394
includes life experience and diversity as well.

683
00:52:53,054 --> 00:53:03,104
I think we've seen in the past with especially with HRCs but board and commissions in general they don't always reflect the makeup of the city and so this ensures the best

684
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:07,451
the best outcome that we can get.

685
00:53:09,871 --> 00:53:29,157
And, you know, with regards to the policy advocacy work, the research and reporting that the HRC does, I believe that inherently human rights includes questions of morality, and that's something for a representative body of our city to get together and discuss.

686
00:53:31,317 --> 00:53:40,164
something that we did actually make sure that was in this ordinance was that the HRC statements will be in the name of the HRC.

687
00:53:40,604 --> 00:53:51,493
But, you know, this is also a public forum for, just like City Council is, although I'm sure with different rules, is a public forum for residents to talk about

688
00:53:53,114 --> 00:53:54,895
what we see as human rights.

689
00:53:54,935 --> 00:54:05,722
But the fact is that so many of the human rights and civil rights that are under attack in our country right now are things that I would believe that at least 90% of the city believes in.

690
00:54:06,302 --> 00:54:10,465
And so I don't see that language affecting that work.

691
00:54:14,043 --> 00:54:22,596
So there was a further amendment to add language in 506060 regarding timeliness of reporting?

692
00:54:23,297 --> 00:54:23,577
Yes.

693
00:54:26,121 --> 00:54:26,802
I can read it out.

694
00:54:27,262 --> 00:54:27,503
Sure.

695
00:54:29,245 --> 00:54:47,112
So at the end of the blurb in 56, uh, 66B, I would insert the words, the following list shall not be exhaustive and all requested information from the city shall be provided in a timely manner.

696
00:54:47,132 --> 00:54:48,012
Okay.

697
00:54:50,733 --> 00:54:53,915
And just a clarifying question, it sounds like staff

698
00:54:56,288 --> 00:54:58,049
the mayor shall sign a city council liaison.

699
00:54:58,729 --> 00:55:01,530
She asked the counselor to do it, but not obligated to do it.

700
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:02,590
Is that correct?

701
00:55:04,771 --> 00:55:06,191
No, I, that would not be correct.

702
00:55:06,551 --> 00:55:20,695
Cause it's, this is the kind of similar language as in other commission ordinances where, you know, she's asked like with the current HRC, for example, it's the same language, like she's asked

703
00:55:21,889 --> 00:55:23,590
Right, so they would not be obligated.

704
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:24,731
They would not be obligated.

705
00:55:24,751 --> 00:55:25,171
Okay, yeah.

706
00:55:26,472 --> 00:55:33,677
And I suspect this is something that the City Council could also vote on, although that's not like a must.

707
00:55:34,857 --> 00:55:38,380
So it could be a resolution to delegate that to someone.

708
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:44,544
I guess what I'm saying is it sounds like you're putting that in to allow City Councilors to be considered.

709
00:55:44,824 --> 00:55:46,545
Yes, yes, exactly, exactly.

710
00:55:47,258 --> 00:55:51,181
Yeah, and that was a suggested language from the mayor's office.

711
00:55:51,601 --> 00:55:51,921
Okay.

712
00:55:55,384 --> 00:55:59,747
Any further discussion by members of the council on the amended amendment?

713
00:56:01,829 --> 00:56:02,429
Seeing none.

714
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:08,434
There is one technical edit that I forgot to mention when I was reading out the amendments, it was just cut off.

715
00:56:08,554 --> 00:56:12,657
I would add our standard severability language at the end of this ordinance.

716
00:56:12,897 --> 00:56:13,157
Okay.

717
00:56:15,502 --> 00:56:33,295
The standard language our city uses is the provisions of this ordinance are severable if any part or provision of this ordinance or the application of this ordinance to any person or circumstance is held invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be affected by such holding and shall continue to have full force and effect.

718
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:38,199
That was in an earlier draft and I just forgot to copy and paste it into this one.

719
00:56:41,396 --> 00:56:44,219
That would just be its own section then.

720
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:45,541
Section 50-67?

721
00:56:45,901 --> 00:56:46,342
Yeah.

722
00:56:46,362 --> 00:56:50,126
All right.

723
00:56:51,328 --> 00:56:53,290
And please send the amendments in a clean copy.

724
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:53,730
Yes.

725
00:56:54,772 --> 00:56:57,875
I'm going to go to Steve Schnapp, name and address for the record.

726
00:56:57,895 --> 00:56:58,896
Steve, you have three minutes.

727
00:56:59,938 --> 00:57:01,880
I'm going to unmute you and I'll restart the timer.

728
00:57:09,611 --> 00:57:10,151
Thank you.

729
00:57:10,551 --> 00:57:11,551
My name is Steve Schnapp.

730
00:57:11,612 --> 00:57:13,552
I live at 36 Hillside Avenue.

731
00:57:14,532 --> 00:57:21,854
I really appreciate Councilor Sang and the council moving on reestablishing the HRC.

732
00:57:22,334 --> 00:57:23,495
I just have one question.

733
00:57:24,055 --> 00:57:28,896
Is there another city commission that is not staffed by the administration?

734
00:57:31,497 --> 00:57:32,717
I do not.

735
00:57:32,777 --> 00:57:36,958
I mean, I don't know if any city commissions are not staffed.

736
00:57:38,123 --> 00:57:38,603
currently.

737
00:57:38,623 --> 00:57:43,548
I don't, I certainly can say there's no city commission staffed by a city councilor.

738
00:57:46,350 --> 00:57:53,356
So it's curious to me that the city administration would not enable that.

739
00:57:57,067 --> 00:58:08,197
So I would urge the council to reconsider putting the language in that Jennifer suggested or striking the language that Jennifer suggested.

740
00:58:08,978 --> 00:58:12,441
But at any rate, thank you very much for finally moving on this.

741
00:58:12,761 --> 00:58:13,842
We greatly appreciate it.

742
00:58:15,063 --> 00:58:15,464
Thank you.

743
00:58:19,207 --> 00:58:22,050
Any further discussion by members of the council?

744
00:58:24,481 --> 00:58:28,024
Seeing none and seeing no discussion members of the public.

745
00:58:28,044 --> 00:58:32,607
We do have a motion from councilor saying as amended to approve as amended by councilor saying.

746
00:58:32,627 --> 00:58:37,310
Is there a second on the motion on the second by Council Lazzaro?

747
00:58:38,972 --> 00:58:40,933
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

748
00:58:41,954 --> 00:58:44,976
For approval for first reading for approval for first reading as amended.

749
00:58:46,197 --> 00:58:46,977
Councilor Callahan.

750
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:47,518
Yes.

751
00:58:48,318 --> 00:58:49,259
Vice President Collins.

752
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:50,140
Yes.

753
00:58:51,904 --> 00:58:52,565
Councilor Lozaro?

754
00:58:52,585 --> 00:58:52,725
Yes.

755
00:58:53,766 --> 00:58:54,707
Councilor Lemming is absent.

756
00:58:55,507 --> 00:58:56,208
Councilor Scarpelli?

757
00:58:56,488 --> 00:58:56,688
Yes.

758
00:58:57,689 --> 00:58:58,250
Councilor Sang?

759
00:58:58,430 --> 00:58:58,610
Yes.

760
00:58:58,951 --> 00:58:59,571
President Behrs?

761
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:02,334
Yes, 60 affirmative, one absent, the motion passes.

762
00:59:02,354 --> 00:59:13,604
25.075 offered by Vice President Collins, proposed amendments to the Medford zoning ordinance, Medford Square District and West Medford Square District for reform of the Community Development Board.

763
00:59:14,625 --> 00:59:15,766
This was referred from the

764
00:59:17,527 --> 00:59:20,548
planning and permitting committee to our regular meeting.

765
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:32,370
The initial proposal, the process from here is that the council is obligated to refer zoning amendments, rightfully presented zoning amendments such as this one to the community development board.

766
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:36,151
The community development board will then hold a public hearing on the matter.

767
00:59:36,971 --> 00:59:39,611
They may choose to make recommendations to the council.

768
00:59:40,252 --> 00:59:47,013
The council will then hold a public hearing on the matter and consider any proposed recommendations from the community development board.

769
00:59:47,693 --> 00:59:55,666
And then after the public hearing of the council is concluded, the council would vote to adopt or reject.

770
00:59:56,126 --> 00:59:58,029
With that, I will go to Vice President Collins.

771
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:00,876
Thank you, President Behrs.

772
01:00:00,916 --> 01:00:10,260
Thank you for outlining the steps that this proposal will take after a vote to refer it out to the Community Development Board this evening.

773
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:24,385
And just to quickly recap the steps that have been taken to get us to this point, like all proposals that have been generated in our comprehensive zoning overhaul this year, or this term, rather,

774
01:00:25,846 --> 01:00:46,243
These proposals, the zoning proposals for West Medford Square, Medford Square, and updates to our ADUs regulations were all developed in the Planning and Permitting Committee with committee members, the zoning consultant and associates, and city staff members of the Planning, Development, and Sustainability Department.

775
01:00:47,705 --> 01:00:52,370
We met on this proposal three times between March and April.

776
01:00:52,410 --> 01:00:59,918
We had a public Q&A on the three proposals last week after they're referred out of the City Council this evening.

777
01:00:59,938 --> 01:01:04,643
They will then begin the public hearing process before the Community Development Board.

778
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:07,566
So far in the process, the Community Development Board has been

779
01:01:08,767 --> 01:01:15,152
taking their time to hold as many hearings on the zoning topics as they have felt the need to, which I think is great, and I'm sure they will continue to do.

780
01:01:15,912 --> 01:01:22,737
That is another opportunity for community members to ask questions and give comment on these proposals as they have been doing.

781
01:01:24,698 --> 01:01:27,939
when these proposals were in the planning and permitting committee as well.

782
01:01:28,759 --> 01:01:33,861
So there has been a lot of discussion of these specific proposals themselves in committee.

783
01:01:33,901 --> 01:01:40,804
There will be a lot more discussion about the specifics of the proposals in CDB when they're gone into in-depth.

784
01:01:40,824 --> 01:01:50,147
So I won't do that yet again here, but if folks want to learn more about these proposals before the CDB public hearings, there's a lot of information

785
01:01:51,007 --> 01:01:55,449
on the city's zoning website medfordma.org slash zoning.

786
01:01:57,290 --> 01:02:03,533
And I encourage all residents to continue to be involved in the planning and permitting committee process and to attend the CDP public hearings.

787
01:02:05,534 --> 01:02:11,397
With that, I would motion to refer the three proposals to the Community Development Board.

788
01:02:11,417 --> 01:02:18,381
On the motion to refer to the Community Development Board by Vice President Kahn, seconded by.

789
01:02:19,246 --> 01:02:20,567
Seconded by Councillor Callaghan.

790
01:02:21,647 --> 01:02:23,168
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

791
01:02:27,850 --> 01:02:28,431
Councillor Callaghan.

792
01:02:28,451 --> 01:02:28,511
Yes.

793
01:02:29,471 --> 01:02:30,372
Vice-President Collins.

794
01:02:30,752 --> 01:02:30,972
Yes.

795
01:02:32,233 --> 01:02:33,033
Councillor Lozaro.

796
01:02:33,293 --> 01:02:33,433
Yes.

797
01:02:34,094 --> 01:02:35,054
Councillor Lemming is absent.

798
01:02:35,634 --> 01:02:36,315
Councillor Scarpelli.

799
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:36,375
No.

800
01:02:38,116 --> 01:02:38,656
Councillor Seng.

801
01:02:39,796 --> 01:02:39,956
Yes.

802
01:02:40,577 --> 01:02:41,177
President Behrs.

803
01:02:41,477 --> 01:02:41,697
Yes.

804
01:02:41,737 --> 01:02:43,798
If I'm in the affirmative, one of the negative, one absent.

805
01:02:44,379 --> 01:02:46,720
The proposal is referred to the Community Development Board.

806
01:02:47,698 --> 01:02:51,661

807
01:02:52,622 --> 01:02:55,965
Medford Square parking lot development RFP evaluation committee update.

808
01:02:56,645 --> 01:02:59,368
I know that Director Hunt was stuck in a Traffic Commission meeting.

809
01:02:59,608 --> 01:03:02,490
We do have Economic Development Director Sal DeStefano with us.

810
01:03:03,151 --> 01:03:04,692
I see several PDS folks in here.

811
01:03:05,072 --> 01:03:07,595
Do we know where Alicia Hunt is?

812
01:03:09,096 --> 01:03:10,137
Still in Traffic Commission.

813
01:03:17,233 --> 01:03:21,634
Is there a motion to table until later in the meeting?

814
01:03:21,654 --> 01:03:30,055
25-077 by Councillor Callaghan, seconded by Councillor Sang.

815
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:32,256
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

816
01:03:34,536 --> 01:03:38,717
I already called the roll, though.

817
01:03:41,897 --> 01:03:42,197
Hold it.

818
01:03:42,557 --> 01:03:43,057
Okay, great.

819
01:03:43,978 --> 01:03:44,558
We do have to vote.

820
01:03:44,618 --> 01:03:45,558
I'm serious.

821
01:03:48,344 --> 01:03:48,544
Really?

822
01:03:49,105 --> 01:03:49,685
I call the roll.

823
01:03:49,745 --> 01:03:56,710
I don't think you have to.

824
01:03:58,051 --> 01:03:59,712
All right.

825
01:04:00,352 --> 01:04:01,433
This is a vote to table.

826
01:04:06,116 --> 01:04:07,697
We'll waste a roll call slip.

827
01:04:07,957 --> 01:04:08,958
Councilor Callahan.

828
01:04:10,399 --> 01:04:11,339
Vice President Collins.

829
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:12,020
Yes.

830
01:04:14,682 --> 01:04:15,402
Wait, no.

831
01:04:15,542 --> 01:04:16,383
Councilor Lozaro.

832
01:04:18,604 --> 01:04:19,584
Councilor Lemming is absent.

833
01:04:19,904 --> 01:04:20,685
Councilor Scarpelli.

834
01:04:22,545 --> 01:04:23,405
Councilor Seng.

835
01:04:24,365 --> 01:04:24,986
President Behrs.

836
01:04:25,006 --> 01:04:25,046
No.

837
01:04:25,506 --> 01:04:28,386
One in the affirmative, five in the negative, one absent.

838
01:04:28,807 --> 01:04:29,687
Motion fails.

839
01:04:31,307 --> 01:04:32,107
Is she coming down here?

840
01:04:32,127 --> 01:04:33,848
Okay.

841
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:41,009
Well, I can just get us a little bit of preview damping while we get there.

842
01:04:43,828 --> 01:04:57,257
So the update that we're receiving from the RFP evaluation committee tonight is regarding the awarding of the proposal submitted by transom.

843
01:04:58,118 --> 01:05:11,967
So we do have here from the mayor, dear president bears and members of the Medford city council evaluation for the request for proposals RFP for lease and development of real property has completed its review and evaluation work.

844
01:05:12,547 --> 01:05:21,654
I respectfully request and recommend that Council permit a presentation to be made to Your Honourable Body on the proposals received, the evaluation process, and the Committee's vote for the preferred developer.

845
01:05:21,674 --> 01:05:26,357
Director of Planning, Development and Sustainability Alicia Hutt will be present at your meeting to present on behalf of the Committee.

846
01:05:26,418 --> 01:05:27,939
Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

847
01:05:28,019 --> 01:05:29,560
Sincerely, Brianna Lugo, current Mayor.

848
01:05:30,677 --> 01:05:38,564
We, the city, has had several plans on Medford Square over the past 20 years.

849
01:05:39,785 --> 01:05:46,150
All of them have talked about activating these surface lots behind and adjacent to City Hall.

850
01:05:46,870 --> 01:05:54,757
And last fall, an RFP was drafted regarding those lots, requesting that proponents

851
01:05:55,437 --> 01:05:56,078
the City of Toronto.

852
01:05:56,098 --> 01:06:00,382
Submit proposals for the redevelopment of those lots based on a number of conditions.

853
01:06:01,242 --> 01:06:03,004
The city did receive two proposals.

854
01:06:03,444 --> 01:06:06,887
There's an evaluation committee of which I was a non voting member.

855
01:06:06,948 --> 01:06:08,269
The mayor was a non voting member.

856
01:06:08,289 --> 01:06:13,413
Um and city staff and our Chamber of Commerce president were voting

857
01:06:21,261 --> 01:06:30,595
The two proponents and then eventually after review, and there was also a scoring sheet based on a bunch of objective criteria.

858
01:06:31,175 --> 01:06:34,240
The committee made a recommendation to award.

859
01:06:36,599 --> 01:06:39,581
the proposal submitted by transom.

860
01:06:40,222 --> 01:06:44,985
Um, and director Hunt is here to share a little bit more about that.

861
01:06:45,566 --> 01:06:52,551
The next steps from here are that now the city will be able to enter into negotiations with the proponent.

862
01:06:53,392 --> 01:06:56,454
Um, the proposal is a starting point, not a final product.

863
01:06:57,194 --> 01:07:04,380
So, um, city staff working with the proponent, um, will be able to

864
01:07:06,063 --> 01:07:06,143
Um.

865
01:07:06,423 --> 01:07:08,225
Tune that proposal.

866
01:07:08,405 --> 01:07:12,688
Hopefully make some changes that I know that the city has wanted to make.

867
01:07:13,168 --> 01:07:18,212
Um and then once a final agreement has been drafted, the city council will need to vote.

868
01:07:18,872 --> 01:07:25,477
To approve the lease agreement for the city on land that these new developments would sit on.

869
01:07:33,922 --> 01:07:37,529
Could we allow Director Hunt to share her screen?

870
01:07:41,957 --> 01:07:44,903
I'll recognize the Director of Planning, Development and Sustainability.

871
01:07:45,961 --> 01:07:46,501
Good evening.

872
01:07:46,681 --> 01:07:47,162
Thank you.

873
01:07:47,462 --> 01:07:54,105
And I do, I just feel the need to be very clear that I wasn't being rude writing in my office to be called down.

874
01:07:55,085 --> 01:08:00,568
In fact, I am a member of our traffic commission and we have been meeting since five o'clock hearing petitions.

875
01:08:01,108 --> 01:08:06,071
And I just told them that I am in favor of the rest of the petitions on the agenda and I had to now leave.

876
01:08:07,592 --> 01:08:14,015
I just, I felt it was important to say that, that that's, that was not me just not being here.

877
01:08:15,536 --> 01:08:34,927
Thank you So I don't normally share from Adobe but I am gonna think there's a full screen option here You It may be I think that's what you want to see.

878
01:08:35,247 --> 01:08:36,608
Oh, it didn't change anything for us.

879
01:08:37,108 --> 01:08:40,170
Oh There's a little thing in the bottom right just a little paper.

880
01:08:40,190 --> 01:08:40,230
Oh

881
01:08:42,968 --> 01:08:43,689
This one?

882
01:08:43,849 --> 01:08:44,069
Yeah.

883
01:08:44,089 --> 01:08:46,171
Does that do anything?

884
01:08:47,592 --> 01:08:47,852
No.

885
01:08:48,032 --> 01:08:48,813
I don't know.

886
01:08:54,658 --> 01:08:57,240
When I go to full screen mode, it doesn't change it on your end.

887
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:58,521
I think I need to reshare.

888
01:08:58,541 --> 01:09:03,085
I need to put it in full screen and then share the screen.

889
01:09:03,125 --> 01:09:03,826
So sorry.

890
01:09:04,006 --> 01:09:04,927
My apologies.

891
01:09:05,447 --> 01:09:06,388
Do you have any tips?

892
01:09:06,408 --> 01:09:07,249
Full screen mode.

893
01:09:07,889 --> 01:09:08,030
And?

894
01:09:12,748 --> 01:09:14,189
No, that doesn't work either.

895
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:16,071
Sorry.

896
01:09:17,432 --> 01:09:20,974
We do have our Medford Community Media Director, Kevin Harrington, to help out.

897
01:09:21,095 --> 01:09:25,498
Do you know how to do it, Kevin?

898
01:09:25,698 --> 01:09:26,439
It's Adobe.

899
01:09:26,979 --> 01:09:27,399
Oh, OK.

900
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:30,642
I do have a PowerPoint version, but I have to go find it on my computer.

901
01:09:30,702 --> 01:09:31,362
I know.

902
01:09:31,523 --> 01:09:31,843
OK.

903
01:09:31,863 --> 01:09:33,684
So what do I do?

904
01:09:33,744 --> 01:09:35,626
You're just doing the window, right?

905
01:09:36,086 --> 01:09:36,406
Yep.

906
01:09:37,968 --> 01:09:38,248
OK.

907
01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:42,150
My apologies.

908
01:09:43,291 --> 01:09:56,693
And I will, as we start, I didn't catch everything that President Baer said, but as we get this started, we were supported by a grant from Mass Development.

909
01:09:56,753 --> 01:10:05,354
There have been a couple of grants, and I'll get into that, but one of them was to support us with a consultant to write the RFP and to help with all of this.

910
01:10:05,494 --> 01:10:08,695
And in fact, the reason I'm in Adobe is because our consultant

911
01:10:12,576 --> 01:10:18,337
you may recognize their name from the planning study, and I'm going to tell you that that is a pure coincidence.

912
01:10:18,797 --> 01:10:20,898
We asked mass development to please.

913
01:10:21,298 --> 01:10:27,119
Would they support this effort of, uh, leasing out these lots and doing this development?

914
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:28,960
And they said, Absolutely.

915
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:30,200
You did the diff with us.

916
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:33,681
You may all remember that the development incremental financing.

917
01:10:34,261 --> 01:10:34,861
Um, that was.

918
01:10:35,761 --> 01:10:37,882
a prelude to leasing out these lots.

919
01:10:37,942 --> 01:10:39,623
They said, we want you to be successful.

920
01:10:40,544 --> 01:10:44,266
We have on-call consultants that can help with an RFP like this.

921
01:10:45,606 --> 01:10:47,748
Have you ever heard of a consultant, Emily Innes?

922
01:10:47,788 --> 01:10:49,489
We think she'd be a good fit for you.

923
01:10:49,609 --> 01:10:50,789
And I said, perfect.

924
01:10:50,849 --> 01:10:55,412
We're already working with her and she is aware of the needs and the preferences of the city.

925
01:10:55,912 --> 01:10:56,993
So that would be a great.

926
01:10:57,033 --> 01:11:01,115
So actually she has other staff, support staff that you all have not met through the

927
01:11:01,675 --> 01:11:05,016
the zoning process that were the consultants on this.

928
01:11:05,036 --> 01:11:07,197
Should I just flip to the PowerPoint version of this?

929
01:11:09,138 --> 01:11:09,938
It's not open.

930
01:11:12,839 --> 01:11:14,900
Share the whole screen and then go into.

931
01:11:21,062 --> 01:11:22,182
Yes, so nobody text me.

932
01:11:22,242 --> 01:11:25,984
I didn't turn off my notifications.

933
01:11:27,907 --> 01:11:29,508
I don't know that we can promise that.

934
01:11:29,568 --> 01:11:30,408
There we go.

935
01:11:31,309 --> 01:11:32,789
All right.

936
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:34,890
Well, I've warned people, okay?

937
01:11:35,311 --> 01:11:49,018
So this evening, so we, this is the space and the evaluation committee, as we were discussing, the mayor and President Behrs were non-voting members.

938
01:11:49,058 --> 01:11:53,660
We were advised by Fiona, our procurement officer, Fiona Maxwell, as well as

939
01:11:54,600 --> 01:12:03,706
Emily Ennis from Ennis Consultants, and actually Claire O'Neill from Mass Development attended all of our meetings and met separately with Sal and myself as we went through this process.

940
01:12:04,206 --> 01:12:20,216
And so then the evaluation committee was myself, Sal DiStefano, our Director of Economic Development, Nina Nazarian, the Chief of Staff, Tim McGiven, our Commissioner of Public Works, and Andrew Mather as the President of the Board of Directors of the Medford Chamber of Commerce.

941
01:12:21,056 --> 01:12:25,339
I will not read everything on all the slides, but I did feel that that one was important.

942
01:12:25,779 --> 01:12:28,081
So this is part of a much longer process.

943
01:12:28,401 --> 01:12:37,788
For those who have not been involved in Medford politics for a long time, there have been many Medford Square master plans, but we specifically referred back to a 2017 one.

944
01:12:38,448 --> 01:12:45,773
And in 2019, there was an evaluation of the real estate development potential of the city-owned properties done by Gamble Associates.

945
01:12:46,554 --> 01:12:49,116
So that helped inform this process as well.

946
01:12:49,636 --> 01:12:57,080
the housing production plan called out these parcels as a good location to bring more housing and more development into the city.

947
01:12:57,100 --> 01:13:04,704
We then did a process that some people may remember with the MAPC, where we went to the senior center.

948
01:13:04,824 --> 01:13:06,185
I got yelled at a lot.

949
01:13:06,245 --> 01:13:07,626
We went to the library.

950
01:13:07,686 --> 01:13:09,106
We talked to people a lot.

951
01:13:09,146 --> 01:13:10,387
We did a bunch of outreach

952
01:13:10,827 --> 01:13:17,973
talking to people about what they would want to see, what were the concerns, because when the city owns the parcels, you can ask for things.

953
01:13:18,293 --> 01:13:20,935
You could ask them to just pay you money and you can sell them.

954
01:13:21,476 --> 01:13:31,724
You can ask, or you can ask for community benefits where they provide things that the city wants to see that is not necessarily cost effective to the developer.

955
01:13:32,304 --> 01:13:40,942
And if we lease the land, if we do it this other way, then we can get some more benefits, community benefits out of this.

956
01:13:41,884 --> 01:13:43,307
And then based on that work,

957
01:13:44,180 --> 01:13:51,166
And from what we had heard from the community, we went and did, prepared an RFP for the lease and development of real property.

958
01:13:52,287 --> 01:13:56,530
So then this RFP process, we put the proposals out, we got those back.

959
01:13:57,071 --> 01:14:04,437
We actually got those back, yes, in late December, but there's been a lot of work that's gone into this since then with reviewing them.

960
01:14:04,917 --> 01:14:07,660
Innis as well did evaluations on these.

961
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:11,002
We also, we then scored these.

962
01:14:11,062 --> 01:14:11,923
We also had a,

963
01:14:13,404 --> 01:14:18,607
Another firm do an economic development review of the proposals as well.

964
01:14:19,328 --> 01:14:25,151
And we requested additional follow-up information from the consultants and we interviewed them as well.

965
01:14:26,112 --> 01:14:32,996
And so now we are here making this recommendation of the preferred vendor, the preferred developer.

966
01:14:34,317 --> 01:14:40,002
We will also need the city council to formally declare the property surplus to municipal requirements.

967
01:14:40,403 --> 01:14:43,846
We did not prepare that for this evening, but that is one of the legal steps.

968
01:14:44,887 --> 01:14:51,133
We are looking to meet with the developer next week to follow up with our lawyers who have also been involved.

969
01:14:51,194 --> 01:14:57,240
So there were sample leases and sample agreements in the RFP that were prepared by our lawyers.

970
01:15:00,001 --> 01:15:05,128
So everybody is clear, I realize that it's not always, not everybody sees maps the same way I do.

971
01:15:05,829 --> 01:15:09,214
To orient you, this is Medford City Hall, this is where we are right now.

972
01:15:10,647 --> 01:15:12,848
This long strip is 93.

973
01:15:13,589 --> 01:15:15,950
And so the Salem Street Rotary is up here.

974
01:15:16,651 --> 01:15:19,593
Vita Real is here in this corner.

975
01:15:20,313 --> 01:15:21,974
So the city owns this lot.

976
01:15:23,515 --> 01:15:25,857
And then that's the pink lot.

977
01:15:25,937 --> 01:15:28,018
And that one we have been calling Lot C.

978
01:15:29,579 --> 01:15:34,242
B is the lot behind us where you often see the buses stopping.

979
01:15:34,282 --> 01:15:35,383
There's a bus stop there.

980
01:15:35,823 --> 01:15:38,185
We've incorporated that into it all along.

981
01:15:38,205 --> 01:15:39,225
We said that's important.

982
01:15:39,666 --> 01:15:40,866
Oops, I didn't mean to go forward.

983
01:15:41,447 --> 01:15:43,708
And that's where the post office trucks are.

984
01:15:44,729 --> 01:15:47,311
We don't own this little small building on the corner.

985
01:15:47,791 --> 01:15:53,275
It's a three-condo building, and we have not been able to incorporate it into the project.

986
01:15:54,055 --> 01:15:58,756
And then there's this yellow lot down here is lot A, it's the one closest to the river.

987
01:16:00,236 --> 01:16:04,177
So to orient you, here is the Peace Garden and the Senior Center.

988
01:16:04,317 --> 01:16:05,898
Our taller buildings are down here.

989
01:16:05,918 --> 01:16:06,798
This is the river.

990
01:16:06,818 --> 01:16:15,180
I will not spend this much time on all the slides, but I do really realize that people don't always see the maps the same way we all do.

991
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:23,943
So these are some of the criteria that we talked about and the things that we rated them on and you can see things that are very important to the city.

992
01:16:23,963 --> 01:16:30,345
You see affordable housing and parking and what their management plan is and what their financial capacity was.

993
01:16:30,385 --> 01:16:38,328
That's one of the things we brought in an outside consultant to review them and make sure they had the capacity to do this and what was their vision.

994
01:16:39,548 --> 01:16:46,031
So we got two responses, the Davis Company's response and Transom Real Estate's response.

995
01:16:46,951 --> 01:16:48,351
Both of them had architects.

996
01:16:49,072 --> 01:16:51,833
Interestingly enough, they both had the same legal counsel with them.

997
01:16:52,333 --> 01:16:57,455
And Transom also brought along landscape architects and Beyond Walls, which is a placemaking.

998
01:16:57,475 --> 01:16:59,736
They do a lot of large art.

999
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:04,821
So this is the two proposed programs.

1000
01:17:05,761 --> 01:17:11,903
You will see, yes, Davis proposed more housing than Transom.

1001
01:17:12,403 --> 01:17:17,705
Transom proposed a higher percentage of affordable housing, which was one of the things we were looking for.

1002
01:17:18,345 --> 01:17:24,367
They both proposed the same amount of commercial space, but that was also notably different when you get down into it.

1003
01:17:25,067 --> 01:17:33,139
And Davis had more parking but less parking per unit when you look at the total number of units versus the number of parking spots.

1004
01:17:34,381 --> 01:17:38,808
And parking and having available parking for the community was very important to us.

1005
01:17:40,009 --> 01:17:43,070
Um, I don't want to spend too much time on all of this.

1006
01:17:43,170 --> 01:17:51,392
And I think that the punch line, most people have already seen the punch line of my proposal, which is that we selected one of them and which one we selected.

1007
01:17:51,412 --> 01:17:56,093
Um, so this was Davis and they had three residential buildings.

1008
01:17:56,773 --> 01:17:59,434
Um, they put the parking underneath each one of them.

1009
01:17:59,834 --> 01:18:09,516
They talked about pocket parks and they had a building over here that was, uh, a proposed pavilion that would have more, um,

1010
01:18:10,979 --> 01:18:16,354
space for businesses and would also be sort of a recreation type space.

1011
01:18:18,724 --> 01:18:20,405
this is the transom proposal.

1012
01:18:20,865 --> 01:18:28,349
The transom proposal has a large residential building in the middle, and then a parking garage over on the right.

1013
01:18:29,349 --> 01:18:35,072
Some of their images of the parking garage, this is where they bring in beyond walls, is to make it not look like a parking garage.

1014
01:18:35,452 --> 01:18:37,573
So your first thought is, that's art.

1015
01:18:37,753 --> 01:18:40,594
And your second idea is, oh, that's parking.

1016
01:18:40,634 --> 01:18:43,375
You may have seen some of this at Assembly Row.

1017
01:18:44,016 --> 01:18:46,517
I've seen that kind of thing all over the world at this point.

1018
01:18:47,317 --> 01:18:58,106
And then the third building closer to the river would also have residents will have three stories of housing but under that would be a large grocery store 14,000 square feet.

1019
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:04,712
It also has open parking closest to the river, and that's actually interesting and very strategic.

1020
01:19:05,052 --> 01:19:10,317
So first of all that parking is directly across from the senior center and how we would treat that and

1021
01:19:10,757 --> 01:19:35,099
how we would arrange the traffic flow would we put in a crossing there or further up at the corner that's something that we would look at but it's very strategic because we have something that's called chapter 91 land chapter 91 is water is land that used to belong to the river that used to be water land and it comes with a very very hefty permitting process that it can take upwards of 18 months

1022
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:43,707
And so the idea here is that they would like to bring in this grocery store, they would like to make some commitments early on.

1023
01:19:44,608 --> 01:19:53,137
It would be one that is of a modest size, this would not be a very large grocery store, so it's not a chain that specializes in very large stores.

1024
01:19:54,177 --> 01:20:07,662
But because this land would remain public parking, which is its current use, there would be no change in use of the Chapter 91 land, which would allow this project to move dramatically faster.

1025
01:20:08,222 --> 01:20:14,745
Anything that involved a building or change of use on this area would require an 18-month permitting process.

1026
01:20:15,898 --> 01:20:29,254
So it both satisfies the desires of the senior center, but it also would speed things up and allows them to make some commitments down here around the business that would go in there as well.

1027
01:20:30,403 --> 01:20:32,805
So here are some conceptual drawings.

1028
01:20:33,825 --> 01:20:35,086
These are all available.

1029
01:20:35,767 --> 01:20:38,128
We can share the whole slide set out as well.

1030
01:20:38,148 --> 01:20:42,571
They're in the proposals, some interconnected pocket parks.

1031
01:20:43,111 --> 01:20:44,892
This was Transom's vision.

1032
01:20:45,373 --> 01:20:50,976
What they're showing is you're standing at the Peace Garden.

1033
01:20:51,477 --> 01:20:53,758
And on your left would be the grocery store.

1034
01:20:54,238 --> 01:20:56,220
And on your right, there would be a cafe.

1035
01:20:56,860 --> 01:21:00,222
And that's how they would activate Riverside Ave.

1036
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:09,826
Part of what we were looking for is that for people who come to the hotel, that right now they stand there and they look at a dark alleyway and they don't think they necessarily want to go down there.

1037
01:21:09,846 --> 01:21:19,551
And if there was a grocery store and a cafe there, they would be drawn down into Medford Square where we have a number of businesses and restaurants down the block.

1038
01:21:21,313 --> 01:21:29,078
this is, if you see here, this is this idea of a parking garage that actually is covered in art and doesn't really look like a parking garage.

1039
01:21:31,780 --> 01:21:33,501
So then we reviewed the proposals.

1040
01:21:33,681 --> 01:21:35,723
Oh, there was one other thing that I did want to highlight.

1041
01:21:35,783 --> 01:21:42,367
It's a little bit here, is that this area between City Hall and the building they're proposing would be a bus stop.

1042
01:21:42,807 --> 01:21:49,432
So we have been working with the MBTA on getting some rapid transit lines from Medford Square to various locations.

1043
01:21:49,972 --> 01:22:00,300
One of them that is planned is from here through Sullivan Square to Kendall Square every 15 minutes at all times and every eight minutes during rush hour.

1044
01:22:00,661 --> 01:22:06,205
And part of what the MBTA needs is some facilities for their bus drivers at the end of the line.

1045
01:22:06,685 --> 01:22:12,270
And so Transom has agreed that there could be bus driver facilities available in this building for them.

1046
01:22:14,045 --> 01:22:23,508
So all the members scored them, and people have asked me, particularly the two developers who I notified, is there any one thing?

1047
01:22:23,929 --> 01:22:33,932
And basically I would tell everybody that Transom across the board scored higher, and all the people who scored them, there was something else.

1048
01:22:34,012 --> 01:22:37,153
It wasn't one thing in any one of these, but across the board,

1049
01:22:37,493 --> 01:22:40,055
There were various things that were important to various people.

1050
01:22:40,735 --> 01:22:50,423
And that's where we ended up with Transom having better scores across the board than Davis did in the various areas we were rating.

1051
01:22:52,004 --> 01:22:53,745
Like I said, we did the interviews.

1052
01:22:53,825 --> 01:22:55,106
We had questions.

1053
01:22:55,166 --> 01:22:56,507
We did a final meeting.

1054
01:22:56,527 --> 01:23:02,152
FXM associates did a final evaluation of the fiscal impacts of both proposals.

1055
01:23:02,872 --> 01:23:07,596
um, to help support what we were saying that there were no financial concerns on all of them.

1056
01:23:08,597 --> 01:23:12,940
Um, and then the city said that we should designate transoms.

1057
01:23:12,980 --> 01:23:21,367
The city started the team recommended that the city should designate transom as the team as the preferred developer and begin negotiations.

1058
01:23:22,028 --> 01:23:26,011
So the long term lease is the part City Council would have to vote to approve that.

1059
01:23:26,871 --> 01:23:36,634
But we're at the point now where we would start negotiating the details of this, and all of this could change and there's some concern is this the right place for a parking garage and the parking garage move.

1060
01:23:37,055 --> 01:23:43,837
How do we manage that in their proposal, they are actually proposing that they should build the parking garage.

1061
01:23:44,537 --> 01:23:56,548
They would like to guarantee revenue in that parking garage by leasing back spots for some of their apartments, but they would like to turn the parking garage and its management over to the city for ownership.

1062
01:23:57,469 --> 01:23:59,891
We asked, what about putting some offices in there?

1063
01:23:59,911 --> 01:24:03,254
And they said, yeah, if you want to put us to put offices as part of it.

1064
01:24:03,274 --> 01:24:08,459
So we're picturing maybe the parking office might want to have their offices directly in the parking garage.

1065
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:16,566
We talked with the parking director they are comfortable with running a parking garage mean they don't have the staff now but by the time it is built.

1066
01:24:17,147 --> 01:24:18,548
That is something that they could do.

1067
01:24:18,568 --> 01:24:25,635
And there would be guaranteed revenue, because the buildings would lease some of the spaces back.

1068
01:24:26,155 --> 01:24:36,504
And then some of the spaces would be available as public parking, as well as I mentioned earlier that open lot closest to the river, at least for now would remain open parking.

1069
01:24:36,844 --> 01:24:39,046
Some people have said to me could it later be developed.

1070
01:24:39,387 --> 01:24:41,629
Yes, we would still have that it would still be.

1071
01:24:42,149 --> 01:24:48,755
but it would take that 18 month permitting process for chapter 91 in order to build something on that back space.

1072
01:24:49,335 --> 01:24:57,322
So that's part of the, all of this could move a lot faster if we leave that as the open space back there or the open parking.

1073
01:24:58,602 --> 01:25:03,826
So we do need to go through detailed negotiations on exactly what we would have.

1074
01:25:06,008 --> 01:25:10,191
So the next steps, well, we have formally notified the designated development team.

1075
01:25:10,232 --> 01:25:12,233
We decided that they shouldn't hear from the press.

1076
01:25:12,353 --> 01:25:13,574
They should get phone calls from us.

1077
01:25:13,614 --> 01:25:16,356
So actually, both teams have heard from us.

1078
01:25:18,739 --> 01:25:24,364
We will need to declare the property surplus to municipal requirements in order to actually sign a lease.

1079
01:25:24,404 --> 01:25:26,005
That's a formal designation.

1080
01:25:26,746 --> 01:25:36,194
We'll negotiate the development program, negotiate the terms of the lease, and then the lease needs to come back to you for approval, and then we would execute that.

1081
01:25:38,116 --> 01:25:39,437
And that is the last slide.

1082
01:25:41,739 --> 01:25:42,239
Questions.

1083
01:25:42,519 --> 01:25:43,480
Thank you, Director Hunt.

1084
01:25:43,660 --> 01:25:46,443
Do we have questions or comments from members of the Council?

1085
01:25:51,441 --> 01:25:51,761
Thank you.

1086
01:25:51,941 --> 01:25:54,061
I appreciate the hard work.

1087
01:25:54,102 --> 01:26:00,864
And I know this is a long time coming, but I think that I have just a few questions as we go through the process.

1088
01:26:00,924 --> 01:26:05,225
And I know this is so important because this is one bite at the apple and I'm so glad that we're doing it.

1089
01:26:06,139 --> 01:26:08,221
So kudos to taking the bike, Alicia.

1090
01:26:08,241 --> 01:26:09,142
I think it's very important.

1091
01:26:09,182 --> 01:26:22,234
But I know that there was questions that we've looked into the different talking about those discussions of maybe looking into traffic flow with the rest of the square and how that would impact this development.

1092
01:26:22,815 --> 01:26:25,477
If we talked about, is Ring Road still available?

1093
01:26:25,497 --> 01:26:31,042
Because I'm sure in your field, you realize that it's a laughingstock across the Commonwealth that

1094
01:26:31,883 --> 01:27:00,462
the joke is what is the only sitting what is the only city that has a has an access road that leaves away from the center of your town and i think that uh that's what we're doing so i like you know it'd be something nice to use the water and and develop that area have we you know the other questions i would have is if we talk to yeah i'm gonna forget all your yeah no no i appreciate it you know that looking at the um uh

1095
01:27:02,765 --> 01:27:21,879
have we met with the other owners of the other buildings in Method Square and worked with them about about maybe finding a way to to to look at the totality of the square and working Riverside Mall and using uh in in talking in working their vision to try to

1096
01:27:22,883 --> 01:27:29,107
you know, uplift the rest of that area and try to truly make it a truly redeveloped area.

1097
01:27:29,127 --> 01:27:32,088
Um, the other questions, probably the biggest one.

1098
01:27:32,128 --> 01:27:32,809
And you said you

1099
01:27:33,670 --> 01:27:43,792
You talked a little bit about it because you're going to get the biggest complaints and concerns and issues from our seniors right now.

1100
01:27:43,852 --> 01:27:45,833
I think that the biggest fear right now is the parking.

1101
01:27:46,193 --> 01:27:50,234
I don't think the parking is enough that's there.

1102
01:27:50,914 --> 01:27:55,895
I know that we've had in different municipalities that I've been involved in

1103
01:27:57,175 --> 01:28:20,088
We've worked in some creative ways and maybe possibly talking about meeting with the seniors and implementing a plan that makes sure that maybe setting up a shuttle service from even though it's just right down the street, you know, it's a huge difference when you're a senior citizen and you're disabled in any way to try to make it from right across the street to behind the

1104
01:28:21,288 --> 01:28:23,889
the hotel.

1105
01:28:23,969 --> 01:28:35,153
So maybe I think and I think that would be important is really reaching out because I've been contacted by a bunch of the seniors from the senior center and they're in an uproar.

1106
01:28:35,233 --> 01:28:44,636
And you know, they, you know, they have we talked about, for instance, one young lady came tonight and asked, have we talked about maybe making sure that the parking goes up first?

1107
01:28:46,765 --> 01:28:47,345
I'm sorry.

1108
01:28:47,546 --> 01:28:55,230
Yeah, talking about the parking first, so I'm glad to see that would be creative with the parking garage, something that we talked about in the past.

1109
01:28:55,310 --> 01:29:06,317
If this is something that's willing to do, how about have we entertained possibly doing a bubble on the top floor of the parking garage where it's a recreational space to bring in more revenue?

1110
01:29:06,977 --> 01:29:10,039
Um, both as a recreational space and, um,

1111
01:29:10,842 --> 01:29:16,484
and a revenue generating source, if we're given the freedom to do that.

1112
01:29:16,564 --> 01:29:34,352
So, you know, on the highway side, I wouldn't mind going up an extra story to put something like that in for the fact that it's creating revenue, it's creating a recreational space for our youth, especially, and a vital space that we know that we need here.

1113
01:29:35,592 --> 01:29:38,794
So, I mean, these are some questions I think that, you know,

1114
01:29:41,030 --> 01:29:45,996
You know, everybody who looks at me like I'm going to be the negative person and I'm going to talk negative about everything.

1115
01:29:46,036 --> 01:29:47,198
I think we need to move.

1116
01:29:48,499 --> 01:29:49,420
And this is a good step.

1117
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:59,733
But I think that being cautious that this is one bite of the apple and making sure that we've exhausted everything possible and the community is really part of it.

1118
01:30:00,750 --> 01:30:24,052
I know I've said that from the beginning of the rezoning you know that and I think that being more proactive especially with the seniors and getting your butt kicked a little bit it's part of the job we all know that but really making our senior citizens feel like they're part of this process not alienating because the rumors again keeps coming to council Scott Pelley the rumors that I'm hearing what people think that there's rumors out there saying that

1119
01:30:24,672 --> 01:30:36,902
maybe possibly we're going to lose the senior center completely, which is a farce, but it's something that I think having the meeting there and bringing it to that backyard and trying to find avenues to

1120
01:30:37,868 --> 01:30:40,530
just to calm everybody down and say, listen, we're thinking of you.

1121
01:30:40,610 --> 01:30:41,471
These are options.

1122
01:30:41,531 --> 01:30:49,718
And our number one priority should be our seniors and their safety and their comfort and their state of mind.

1123
01:30:49,878 --> 01:30:52,160
So I know that's a lot, but I appreciate it.

1124
01:30:52,180 --> 01:30:53,421
It's the first time we could speak on it.

1125
01:30:53,461 --> 01:30:56,444
So I'm really excited about the designs.

1126
01:30:57,745 --> 01:31:16,091
I was fortunate enough to, I've said it a thousand times, that when Mayor Curt Atone back in 2008 started this little project, that he brought me to this little despicable piece of land and he opened up a trailer and showed this amazing plant that went from one end to the other and that's still growing.

1127
01:31:18,312 --> 01:31:20,953
And I think that's why I bring up the fact that I'd love to see what

1128
01:31:21,786 --> 01:31:24,468
what options are moving throughout the whole square.

1129
01:31:24,488 --> 01:31:25,549
So thank you.

1130
01:31:27,690 --> 01:31:45,042
Just if I could really quickly to Councillor Scarpelli's point, something that, you know, having talked in the council in general and looked at the plans and worked with the team, in the RFP before we got proposals, so the request for proposals, we did include some additional language around

1131
01:31:45,845 --> 01:32:00,610
the city owned parking lots behind the strip along Riverside Avenue and also the City Hall property itself to see if maybe we could encourage some potential expansion and renovation of this building.

1132
01:32:02,596 --> 01:32:16,847
And we spoke with atrius health to see if we could leverage the parking garage, and we spoke with Hamilton well not me but you spoke with Hamilton companies about all of the property that they own on Riverside so those were.

1133
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:31,870
included in the process, and I think, at least for me, as I continue to participate in the process, going back at bites at those at those apples and really trying to see if we can get them on board is going to be a priority for me.

1134
01:32:32,890 --> 01:32:40,856
And Davis had also done some preliminary designs on potentially some upgrades to this building, which I think would be really great that maybe we could

1135
01:32:41,917 --> 01:32:42,799
to incorporate as well.

1136
01:32:42,839 --> 01:32:48,347
So I just wanted to put all of that out there that those were some things that I raised as part of the process that are still going to be a priority for me.

1137
01:32:48,848 --> 01:32:52,213
But thank you for giving me time and Director Hunt, I'll turn it over to you.

1138
01:32:52,867 --> 01:32:54,088
respond to some of those.

1139
01:32:54,108 --> 01:32:56,409
So I'll just build on that quickly.

1140
01:32:56,609 --> 01:33:04,332
So we have been talking, as President Zack Baer says, to a number of the property owners in the area.

1141
01:33:04,392 --> 01:33:10,014
I will tell you that I met with the owner of the Hamilton Company as recently as late last week.

1142
01:33:11,495 --> 01:33:17,918
Theirs is the building that has Ebisuya that people know about, that it does look like it needs to come down.

1143
01:33:18,738 --> 01:33:28,908
Um, and in fact, I have asked him to please have his his architect contact me as soon as he has somebody on board because they should not be designing to the zoning that exists.

1144
01:33:29,289 --> 01:33:33,433
But actually, we would like to work directly with their architect on what they're thinking.

1145
01:33:34,113 --> 01:33:37,417
He is open to redoing the entire stretch.

1146
01:33:38,137 --> 01:33:41,982
He actually owns the entire set of buildings facing the river.

1147
01:33:43,743 --> 01:33:54,936
I don't know how to describe it off the top of my head, but from here, from the parking lot, the building that exists, the health building, all the way down, not the bank building, so short of the bank building, so all of that.

1148
01:33:56,176 --> 01:34:03,981
being able to work with them would really open up some opportunities we have a river street that would be great if it went all the way through his building to river street.

1149
01:34:04,381 --> 01:34:18,409
And that's one of the things we want to talk to him about is how could we leverage some of the city parking some of the city spaces to open that back up, getting access to having river street going straight through to to the river to the ring road as you name it a clipper ship.

1150
01:34:18,889 --> 01:34:24,813
drive as people know it now, would really help us facilitate changing the directions of the roads.

1151
01:34:25,234 --> 01:34:36,462
We asked the developers if they had thought about that, and they kind of said yes, but things were a little too rushed for them, even though they had three months to respond, to really dig into that.

1152
01:34:36,882 --> 01:34:37,883
And they're open to it.

1153
01:34:37,923 --> 01:34:39,284
We still want to discuss it.

1154
01:34:39,925 --> 01:34:42,206
There are a couple of very creative solutions.

1155
01:34:42,266 --> 01:34:44,268
I don't know if it's easier for me to point to the map.

1156
01:34:44,728 --> 01:35:01,109
but one of the things that we have thought about is could you actually redirect the main flow of traffic instead of sweeping around and coming between that building in the senior center to actually cut and come up to this street here that is between City Hall

1157
01:35:02,008 --> 01:35:05,109
and the medical building, have that be the main route.

1158
01:35:05,569 --> 01:35:12,532
And then the area that's between this new building and the senior center, have that be emergency access only.

1159
01:35:12,892 --> 01:35:16,013
Maybe it's just a bus lane and emergency access.

1160
01:35:16,473 --> 01:35:21,735
And so that the seniors would have the open parking there behind the buildings by the river.

1161
01:35:22,236 --> 01:35:28,058
And then it would just be an open, more of a bus lane that they're crossing and not a road.

1162
01:35:28,478 --> 01:35:30,699
that they're crossing to get over to the senior center.

1163
01:35:31,019 --> 01:35:33,580
That would change up a lot of the traffic flows.

1164
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:41,303
That would also allow us to make this area over here between this building and the new garage more of a plaza area.

1165
01:35:41,983 --> 01:35:46,224
We have to look at exactly how the traffic would flow, but we'd like to be creative with this.

1166
01:35:47,845 --> 01:35:49,346
and think outside of the box.

1167
01:35:49,786 --> 01:36:02,432
It is we do understand now that one-way streets can be a real killer for economic development for business districts and so this may be the time to change the traffic flows of these streets.

1168
01:36:02,833 --> 01:36:07,055
I do think that working with the Hamilton company is going to be necessary to part of that.

1169
01:36:07,895 --> 01:36:14,480
Um, so all of that, to be said, is absolutely part of this discussion and negotiation that we're still having.

1170
01:36:15,001 --> 01:36:35,416
Um, we did hire a consultant to do a, uh, first look past design for the water area, and that's part of what ended up with this pop-up park, because one of the things that really became aware is that anything permanent we wanted to do between Clippership and the water was gonna have to go through a Chapter 91 process.

1171
01:36:36,657 --> 01:36:43,041
building, putting in benches or a water, a dock, putting in a seating wall and stuff.

1172
01:36:43,501 --> 01:36:46,704
And that meant none of that was going to happen in a short time frame.

1173
01:36:46,944 --> 01:36:49,906
Anything we were going to do over there was going to take a long time.

1174
01:36:50,386 --> 01:36:51,807
So we would like to do that.

1175
01:36:51,867 --> 01:36:54,489
And we do have some draft ideas that we've put together.

1176
01:36:54,569 --> 01:36:57,330
We've put out to the public a couple of times some ideas.

1177
01:36:58,411 --> 01:37:01,713
The other thing is that we did this diff, which takes any

1178
01:37:02,954 --> 01:37:10,059
a portion of the new revenue taxes that would come from anywhere in the square into a special account to feed back into the square.

1179
01:37:10,499 --> 01:37:20,346
So that could help pay for some of the permitting that would be needed for the park area, for some of the things like a new dock, that we could capture some of that money there.

1180
01:37:20,366 --> 01:37:27,692
And that's part of what absolutely is under discussion and we'll need to be discussing with them.

1181
01:37:29,913 --> 01:37:33,034
We did ask about space around a garage.

1182
01:37:33,134 --> 01:37:36,395
I like the idea of a space on top for recreation.

1183
01:37:36,435 --> 01:37:38,475
We had talked about how could we build a gym in.

1184
01:37:38,936 --> 01:37:47,398
Basically what we need to do is how do we get enough community benefit out of this to make this amazing for the city without

1185
01:37:47,798 --> 01:37:52,244
killing the project right what is their pain point where they say we can't do this anymore.

1186
01:37:53,285 --> 01:37:59,993
So that's where we are looking at this we had thought about can we put recreation offices over there can we put a gym like how does this look.

1187
01:38:00,394 --> 01:38:03,798
And I think these are all the kinds of things that we want to be talking about with them.

1188
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:22,446
And I think I'll just wrap it up by saying that both developers when we met with them felt very strongly that us doing this project is going to be transformational between this and the rezoning of Medford Square, which is now being moving its way through the process.

1189
01:38:23,987 --> 01:38:28,752
that will absolutely open up and get developers interested in this.

1190
01:38:29,232 --> 01:38:34,757
I've had other property owners, smaller buildings, approach me and say, but what do we do if we have no parking?

1191
01:38:35,258 --> 01:38:37,060
And so that's part of what we need to figure out.

1192
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:45,508
The Hamilton space is frankly big enough that they can be doing real parking for their spaces and they can be putting residential and stuff in there.

1193
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:47,089
So how do we make this work?

1194
01:38:47,129 --> 01:38:50,471
And how do we make that building face the river and have plazas?

1195
01:38:50,531 --> 01:38:54,613
You can have outdoor dining facing the river and not facing Riverside Ave.

1196
01:38:55,154 --> 01:38:55,674
Absolutely.

1197
01:38:55,694 --> 01:39:00,817
It's a separate project, but it is very much on our radar and something that we're looking to work with.

1198
01:39:01,397 --> 01:39:03,899
We've also, the Hamilton company has indicated that

1199
01:39:04,606 --> 01:39:10,471
Potentially, if there were other developers interested in partnering with them, they're not closed to that idea.

1200
01:39:10,832 --> 01:39:19,700
They were not ready to make any kind of agreement in the short window that had from when we released the RFP to when the RFP had to be closed.

1201
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:23,243
But they're not closed to that idea.

1202
01:39:23,903 --> 01:39:28,227
So, in fact, they had a development partner who was closed to that idea, and they bought them out.

1203
01:39:30,232 --> 01:39:31,653
Um, other anything else?

1204
01:39:32,253 --> 01:39:35,194
Yeah, just one more.

1205
01:39:35,235 --> 01:39:35,455
Thank you.

1206
01:39:35,475 --> 01:39:36,255
This is great questions.

1207
01:39:36,275 --> 01:39:49,081
One thing that as we talked about, you know, mainstays and the, you know, the, uh, you know, the, um, gateways, uh, is the money been exhausted?

1208
01:39:49,101 --> 01:39:53,323
I know there was money years ago for the parking garage that failed behind Colleen's.

1209
01:39:53,363 --> 01:39:58,886
Cause I think that that might be having two types of two types of anchor parking.

1210
01:39:59,423 --> 01:40:14,493
I mean, we would hate, honestly, to waste five people tell you and use in your field, you know, that putting a parking garage is frowned upon because it's valuable space in a sense, but where we already have parking.

1211
01:40:15,275 --> 01:40:19,219
have we, there's been any discussion again to rebuild that parking garage behind calling.

1212
01:40:19,479 --> 01:40:22,722
So there was a grant, I'm going to say it was roughly 2010.

1213
01:40:22,862 --> 01:40:33,612
Um, I do have files on it, but the city, uh, the council at the time, which none of these members, including yourself were on the council at the time, voted not to accept that grant.

1214
01:40:34,152 --> 01:40:36,595
Um, so that would have to be, plus it was 15 years ago.

1215
01:40:36,955 --> 01:40:38,877
So it would have to be sort of re approached.

1216
01:40:39,357 --> 01:40:40,378
a project like that.

1217
01:40:41,239 --> 01:40:51,430
It is an interesting question whether they're behind the Colleen's is the right location for a second parking garage or whether this would be sufficient for all of it.

1218
01:40:51,850 --> 01:40:56,736
It's certainly something I think that if we move this project forward because it's ready,

1219
01:40:57,376 --> 01:41:04,343
and built this garage and said, we have parking pressure on the square and we could have more development if there was more parking.

1220
01:41:04,684 --> 01:41:13,072
That's the kind of thing that you go back to mass development and you say, we need more city infrastructure in order to unlock more development in the city.

1221
01:41:13,533 --> 01:41:15,175
And that's, we would go back to them for it.

1222
01:41:16,076 --> 01:41:18,979
I think my instinct, and Claire's not here, right?

1223
01:41:21,308 --> 01:41:25,830
She might be online, but she had tried to make it to here this evening.

1224
01:41:27,571 --> 01:41:33,174
If we were to ask them for that money right now, they would say, do you have a parking study?

1225
01:41:33,214 --> 01:41:33,875
Can you prove it?

1226
01:41:33,935 --> 01:41:35,315
Do this project first?

1227
01:41:35,455 --> 01:41:37,196
Like, what's, you know, where is that?

1228
01:41:37,757 --> 01:41:40,438
That doesn't mean that we wouldn't ask Mass Development for

1229
01:41:40,918 --> 01:41:41,298
for money.

1230
01:41:41,318 --> 01:41:53,747
I will just sort of jump in there with you can get mass development for infrastructure needs in order to unlock development potential, and that is part of where that RFP support came from.

1231
01:41:54,588 --> 01:41:57,050
We have checked with our water and sewer.

1232
01:41:57,110 --> 01:42:06,577
Tim McGivern was on this committee, and there is no concern about the city infrastructure that we own around water supply, sewer, etc., storm drains.

1233
01:42:07,317 --> 01:42:08,539
being able to handle this.

1234
01:42:08,739 --> 01:42:12,643
I know some people have sort of asked, but we are confident on that in this location.

1235
01:42:12,663 --> 01:42:21,351
And it's if we were looking for money, it would be around redoing the streets and the layout of the streets and lights and stuff like that.

1236
01:42:24,715 --> 01:42:25,395
Great, thank you.

1237
01:42:25,455 --> 01:42:26,777
I'll go to Councilor Callahan.

1238
01:42:28,150 --> 01:42:29,251
Thank you.

1239
01:42:29,531 --> 01:42:30,973
This is a very exciting project.

1240
01:42:31,313 --> 01:42:37,379
I'm really quite happy to see these plans coming together after so many years of work.

1241
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:39,762
Just a few comments and then a couple of questions.

1242
01:42:41,203 --> 01:42:50,653
I know that in one of the master plans, there really was an analysis of Medford Square and the very specific types of businesses that we have there and the difference between

1243
01:42:51,153 --> 01:43:01,421
the types of businesses that we have and the types of businesses that create a really walkable, safe, kind of vibrant square that I think everyone here talks about and wishes for.

1244
01:43:02,182 --> 01:43:13,031
And many people even look back to 30, 40 years ago with warmth about how it used to be more that way when there were bookstores and other places that people frequented.

1245
01:43:13,471 --> 01:43:17,234
So I say that because I'm very excited about the grocery store coming in.

1246
01:43:17,715 --> 01:43:20,477
I'm also very excited to see a coffee shop coming in.

1247
01:43:21,297 --> 01:43:28,162
Um, and I really also do appreciate, um, all the work that you do in talking specifically to developers.

1248
01:43:28,542 --> 01:43:37,248
I recently got, um, you know, an email from a resident, um, asking if they can, if we can stop a bank from coming into Bedford Square.

1249
01:43:37,788 --> 01:43:56,011
because they they're like we can't have more banks and insurance companies and places where you don't you know need to go um or enjoy to go um and please i hope no one is offended by my mention of those two specifically but i think there are there are many um in medford square that are

1250
01:43:57,123 --> 01:44:04,126
not the types that were identified in that master plan as being ones that are going to create the vibrancy we want.

1251
01:44:04,166 --> 01:44:20,692
So I do appreciate all of the work that you are doing, too, because we cannot simply dictate as a city council what people rent to and what businesses come in, but we can talk to developers and try to encourage them to bring certain types of businesses in.

1252
01:44:20,712 --> 01:44:22,693
So I appreciate all your work there.

1253
01:44:24,233 --> 01:44:52,215
I did want to mention also that I think one of the benefits, and I think this came up in a conversation that we had about this particular project, one of the benefits of having a garage that is not underneath the residential units, that is actually a small bit away and maybe you have to cross the street, is that I certainly hope that the residents who move in will

1254
01:44:53,443 --> 01:44:59,486
hesitate to jump in their cars just a little bit more and be more likely to walk, to walk into Medford Square.

1255
01:44:59,506 --> 01:45:11,952
We're talking, you know, obviously those who are young and able to do that, but hoping that people, that this creates naturally just a little bit more of a walkable square.

1256
01:45:13,433 --> 01:45:23,902
and lowers our need for, like people get very concerned about the traffic that's caused by new development and new residents moving in and new housing.

1257
01:45:24,683 --> 01:45:30,268
And I hope that that will be a little bit ameliorated by the fact that the garage is not underneath

1258
01:45:30,728 --> 01:45:32,090
the building of the residence.

1259
01:45:32,131 --> 01:45:36,738
So I really appreciate that as a very thoughtful way to approach some of these things.

1260
01:45:37,198 --> 01:45:38,340
I had a couple of questions.

1261
01:45:38,660 --> 01:45:45,811
One is about the parking, and I do understand that there are a lot of some of the seniors who are concerned

1262
01:45:46,332 --> 01:45:49,456
that the senior center parking will not be as large.

1263
01:45:50,337 --> 01:45:58,367
And I'm curious if any of the parking will be designated for seniors or how many of those spots will be designated as handicapped spots.

1264
01:45:59,068 --> 01:46:03,192
That might also help for those seniors who really do need for

1265
01:46:04,874 --> 01:46:07,476
to have a spot that is very, very close to the senior center.

1266
01:46:07,877 --> 01:46:13,761
If we have a larger number of handicapped spots because it is directly across the street from the senior center.

1267
01:46:13,781 --> 01:46:14,842
So I wanted to ask about that.

1268
01:46:15,822 --> 01:46:21,587
And then I, this is more my curiosity about your opinion based upon a lot of the zoning that we have done.

1269
01:46:22,587 --> 01:46:25,169
But my second question is really about a step back

1270
01:46:26,430 --> 01:46:41,876
So looking at the sort of envisioning diagram that they, the picture that they painted of what it might look like when standing in the memorial garden, that it does create a little bit of a sort of a corridor, like one of these wind tunnels of height.

1271
01:46:42,377 --> 01:46:47,599
And I was curious, because in my mind, the step backs where you start off

1272
01:46:48,159 --> 01:46:57,565
like, you know, coming up from the sidewalk, but then the top couple of floors are actually backed away, that that might help to, you know, reduce a little bit of that feeling.

1273
01:46:57,885 --> 01:46:59,846
And I was curious about what your thoughts were about that.

1274
01:47:01,667 --> 01:47:07,731
So I will say it's sort of the detailed exactly how many spots are here and there and how many are handicapped.

1275
01:47:07,811 --> 01:47:13,855
I really feel that that is part of like the detailed negotiation that we start to look at as we get further into it.

1276
01:47:14,555 --> 01:47:20,483
It would certainly be some part of the site plan review, and it's something that we'll be looking at and considering.

1277
01:47:21,204 --> 01:47:26,531
But I certainly couldn't like, oh, this is how nothing is set in stone at this point.

1278
01:47:27,372 --> 01:47:28,894
But this is where we're looking at it.

1279
01:47:29,915 --> 01:47:40,702
For the step backs, it is true that when you put those are more expensive to build than building straight up, just in the details of building the building.

1280
01:47:40,802 --> 01:47:43,523
So developers never propose those to begin with.

1281
01:47:43,904 --> 01:47:48,947
That is the kind of thing that we start looking at shadows and we ask them about and look and feel.

1282
01:47:48,967 --> 01:47:51,148
And that's the kind of thing that you push into.

1283
01:47:51,528 --> 01:47:54,210
and it's the kind of thing that we really will need to think about.

1284
01:47:54,770 --> 01:47:57,632
Where do we want to push them for community benefits?

1285
01:47:58,152 --> 01:48:05,357
Is a little bit larger parking garage with a few more spots, is that more important or is it the step back?

1286
01:48:05,417 --> 01:48:07,618
You know, like, is it another affordable unit?

1287
01:48:07,658 --> 01:48:11,420
Like, where do we, like, all of these things have costs.

1288
01:48:11,480 --> 01:48:14,022
Can we get recreational space out of it as well?

1289
01:48:14,062 --> 01:48:17,244
Which is honestly is something that has been on our minds and something

1290
01:48:17,784 --> 01:48:19,705
that we have been floating around.

1291
01:48:20,746 --> 01:48:25,108
So it is something that we'll be talking about, we'll be looking at as the details of this.

1292
01:48:25,568 --> 01:48:32,352
We'll have a lot more say in this than we would in a building that is 100% privately proposed and developed.

1293
01:48:33,173 --> 01:48:36,174
So those are the types of things that we will be looking at.

1294
01:48:36,274 --> 01:48:39,256
I think that I hit the things you'd asked about.

1295
01:48:39,276 --> 01:48:40,417
So, yes.

1296
01:48:40,437 --> 01:48:41,617
Thank you so much.

1297
01:48:43,158 --> 01:48:43,759
Thank you.

1298
01:48:43,919 --> 01:48:45,880
Any other comments or questions from members of the Council?

1299
01:48:48,149 --> 01:48:53,208
just wanted to note along those points too that I think the flip side of some of this is

1300
01:48:55,340 --> 01:48:59,421
how much bigger do certain elements of the project get to allow for more community benefits, right?

1301
01:48:59,521 --> 01:49:03,402
And also like, what is the financing capacity of the entity that we're working with?

1302
01:49:03,482 --> 01:49:08,743
And so those are like two of the other things that we're kind of working through.

1303
01:49:09,203 --> 01:49:15,265
I will add that we are interested in seeing if we can do more housing and so more units.

1304
01:49:15,905 --> 01:49:19,546
Some of the stuff that plays into this, and I've seen floated around,

1305
01:49:20,146 --> 01:49:23,667
And I'm afraid that I'm going to get the numbers wrong off the top of my head.

1306
01:49:24,147 --> 01:49:29,889
But there's a certain so if you go over five stories, now you're getting into steel construction.

1307
01:49:30,290 --> 01:49:35,892
And so you can do two stories of concrete, which may be like your parking garage, and then five stories of wood.

1308
01:49:36,332 --> 01:49:41,874
And if you go bigger than that, you're in steel construction, it has a completely different costs.

1309
01:49:42,294 --> 01:49:45,315
So one of the things that I have been generally hearing is,

1310
01:49:46,235 --> 01:49:52,699
that we were very clear with the developers that all the guardrails were off.

1311
01:49:53,059 --> 01:49:58,061
They should not be looking at our zoning that they should be proposing what they really think they can do here.

1312
01:49:58,542 --> 01:50:02,624
And as you go more units, you kind of do need some more parking.

1313
01:50:02,724 --> 01:50:08,627
It is unreasonable to think that people will live immediately next to an entrance to 93 and not own a car.

1314
01:50:08,667 --> 01:50:10,448
And if they do, they're going to have to

1315
01:50:10,828 --> 01:50:14,711
even if what they use that car for is for weekend travels, right?

1316
01:50:15,772 --> 01:50:16,793
So there is some of that.

1317
01:50:16,833 --> 01:50:22,597
We'll ask for zip car spaces and things like that and Uber lift drop off spaces as well.

1318
01:50:23,338 --> 01:50:31,784
But it is actually true that they don't wanna go too tall because then they hit other things with the building code and it suddenly becomes a lot more expensive.

1319
01:50:32,164 --> 01:50:33,745
And we hear you about the banks.

1320
01:50:34,366 --> 01:50:37,508
And can I say something about the spot that's backup for lease?

1321
01:50:38,569 --> 01:50:44,755
Um, so there was a bank coming to Medford Square and the real estate agents are now looking for a new tenant for that space.

1322
01:50:45,416 --> 01:50:49,921
Um, so yay and the yes it's the vault is back on the market.

1323
01:50:50,521 --> 01:50:56,968
Um, and so the real estate agents do know that we would strongly prefer some other kind of business in that space.

1324
01:50:56,988 --> 01:50:58,189
A restaurant.

1325
01:50:58,449 --> 01:50:59,350
A restaurant.

1326
01:50:59,450 --> 01:51:00,271
A fully functioning restaurant.

1327
01:51:01,392 --> 01:51:08,741
With a bar that is open after the Chevalier ends, you know, we all want to stop out for a drink afterwards.

1328
01:51:10,222 --> 01:51:16,229
So we're hoping and we try, but you're right, we cannot prevent them from coming.

1329
01:51:17,651 --> 01:51:19,633
But we try to push for them.

1330
01:51:21,818 --> 01:51:44,173
Yeah, it's the five over two, and even Davis, they proposed three five over twos, but didn't go above that, even though Hyatt Place is obviously taller, and the Medford Housing Authority buildings are obviously taller, and even the zoning we are gonna pass is gonna allow more in those spaces, or zoning that's been proposed is allowing that.

1331
01:51:44,333 --> 01:51:48,315
So, yeah, it's a tough, tough one.

1332
01:51:48,996 --> 01:51:50,537
Councilor Lazaro, then Councilor Singh.

1333
01:51:52,183 --> 01:51:52,663
Councilor Newton.

1334
01:51:52,683 --> 01:51:54,164
Councilor saying has okay.

1335
01:51:54,825 --> 01:51:57,646
I just wanted to note that sometimes when, um.

1336
01:51:58,707 --> 01:52:05,591
Our residency are zoning proposals where there are allowable taller buildings.

1337
01:52:06,051 --> 01:52:12,355
Um it gets a little concerning for residents because they say, Well, that's going to be so many big tall

1338
01:52:18,418 --> 01:52:22,621
Um, something is allowable and it doesn't immediately happen.

1339
01:52:22,781 --> 01:52:25,863
So just it's it's expensive to to build.

1340
01:52:25,983 --> 01:52:30,727
I mean it it's It would be really hard to make something like that happen.

1341
01:52:30,767 --> 01:52:33,108
So, uh, this is a great case in point.

1342
01:52:33,429 --> 01:52:34,369
Um and

1343
01:52:35,778 --> 01:52:43,723
I just got an email from somebody who had found out that there was a bank going in where the vault used to be and asking if I could do anything to stop that.

1344
01:52:44,644 --> 01:52:54,310
I asked her if I could call her because I wanted to explain the reasoning that I've heard from business owners about why banks are a great thing to have as a tenant.

1345
01:52:55,491 --> 01:52:56,992
Clean they pay their rent.

1346
01:52:57,012 --> 01:52:59,534
They're um, really consistent.

1347
01:52:59,614 --> 01:53:02,196
They're not They're never bad tenants.

1348
01:53:02,336 --> 01:53:13,163
But um, and you know, it's not up to us to say no um to uh an owner of a space but Of course, we listen to our residents and we live here too.

1349
01:53:13,383 --> 01:53:17,947
And we know when uh what it's like to live in a neighborhood That's a business

1350
01:53:18,627 --> 01:53:22,349
that is adjacent to a business district that is full of banks.

1351
01:53:23,650 --> 01:53:24,450
We do, we do.

1352
01:53:24,511 --> 01:53:28,973
We all need banks for a variety of things, but we don't need that many of them.

1353
01:53:29,253 --> 01:53:30,654
That being said, thank you for your work on this.

1354
01:53:30,714 --> 01:53:40,740
I think it's a lovely proposal, and I do appreciate that it's still a moving picture to some degree.

1355
01:53:41,801 --> 01:53:47,504
So thanks, and I would, has anybody a motion to approve?

1356
01:53:49,069 --> 01:53:49,609
Oh, okay.

1357
01:53:51,050 --> 01:53:51,810
I guess I would do that.

1358
01:53:52,811 --> 01:53:53,151
Thank you.

1359
01:53:53,971 --> 01:53:55,732
Never a bad tenant until they need a bailout.

1360
01:53:57,973 --> 01:53:58,614
Councillor Sang.

1361
01:53:59,434 --> 01:53:59,854
Thank you.

1362
01:54:00,314 --> 01:54:03,336
I know you all have been working really, really hard on this.

1363
01:54:03,396 --> 01:54:07,698
I've been hearing updates here and there, and every time I hear an update, it's even more exciting.

1364
01:54:10,059 --> 01:54:18,026
I've just gotten so many, you know, positive comments about about this happening in the city and people are really excited.

1365
01:54:18,046 --> 01:54:21,689
I mean, even if people have questions about parts of it, I think, overall,

1366
01:54:22,725 --> 01:54:24,646
There's just this enthusiasm.

1367
01:54:24,926 --> 01:54:34,091
I think I want to remind everyone, I mentioned this a few meetings ago but you know the first time I was knocking on doors, Medford Square came up alive.

1368
01:54:34,551 --> 01:54:39,634
And, you know, I think at the time, people asked us, or asked me at least like.

1369
01:54:40,432 --> 01:54:44,837
when are we going to stop planning and when are we going to start doing?

1370
01:54:45,257 --> 01:54:49,301
And I think this is us doing, and I'm really, really excited about that.

1371
01:54:50,242 --> 01:55:02,935
And I think, you know, a key point is, I think with any big redevelopment project like this, you're never going to get 100% of what everyone envisions Medford Square to be, because we all have different

1372
01:55:03,155 --> 01:55:18,259
different visions and different needs and priorities to but I actually think that the transit proposal reaches really high marks on what people who have very different lived experiences are asking of Medford square.

1373
01:55:18,279 --> 01:55:19,739
I think that's really impressive.

1374
01:55:22,220 --> 01:55:26,923
You know, I think you've addressed a lot of what I've heard most tonight.

1375
01:55:27,844 --> 01:55:41,893
I think I'm hearing a lot from seniors about parking, hearing, and I'm glad to hear that, you know, we're getting that parking lot and that it's not just going to be any parking lot, that it'll be a parking lot that

1376
01:55:42,493 --> 01:55:48,318
Um, you know, the city has some say over, um, that it'll, that they'll be public art integrated too.

1377
01:55:48,958 --> 01:55:56,083
Um, Vic Frater joked to me, you know, I, I, because, you know, there are residents who are concerned about increasing parking too.

1378
01:55:56,764 --> 01:56:08,453
And, um, Vic Frater joked to me that with Alicia Hunt leading the charge, we're going to get the most environmentally friendly, most artistic, beautiful parking lot we can get.

1379
01:56:08,993 --> 01:56:11,195
I never heard that.

1380
01:56:14,757 --> 01:56:20,500
And if the renderings are anything to go by, I think we're definitely heading in that direction.

1381
01:56:21,060 --> 01:56:22,861
So I am grateful for that.

1382
01:56:25,262 --> 01:56:28,824
Very funny comment from him.

1383
01:56:29,124 --> 01:56:33,006
With the riverside, I think that's the riverfront opening up that capacity.

1384
01:56:33,066 --> 01:56:34,227
I think that's something I hear

1385
01:56:35,358 --> 01:56:36,959
just as much, to be honest.

1386
01:56:37,780 --> 01:56:47,607
I know it's really important to let folks at home know that, you know, the City of Medford is not in itself a private property developer, so we can't

1387
01:56:48,838 --> 01:57:05,163
build the buildings the way that we want to see it, but we can work with developers and work with property owners to nudge them in the direction that we want to see, to work with them to make sure that, you know, their vision is aligning with what our vision is.

1388
01:57:06,364 --> 01:57:14,827
And I'm grateful that you guys are doing so much of that hard work reaching out to, I guess, to that point.

1389
01:57:17,611 --> 01:57:27,600
I think it was really important for residents to hear tonight that we are working really hard to try to reorient the square towards our natural features, towards our strengths.

1390
01:57:31,202 --> 01:57:38,526
I think it's also important to hear the timelines and the permitting processes that go behind a lot of these.

1391
01:57:39,007 --> 01:57:45,430
It sounds like most of these permitting steps are state law requirements.

1392
01:57:46,931 --> 01:57:56,276
Is there anything besides what's in the current zoning update on our front that is adding to that timeline delay?

1393
01:57:57,300 --> 01:58:06,889
So it's my hope that we'll, as we finalize the zoning for this, that this will be coming as a right building, so there won't be any need to go to zoning board.

1394
01:58:07,350 --> 01:58:10,633
Because of the size of it, it will need to go to site plan review.

1395
01:58:11,153 --> 01:58:13,896
It is my hope that we will negotiate this.

1396
01:58:13,976 --> 01:58:19,221
So Danielle Evans and I, the senior planner, we advise the community development board.

1397
01:58:19,241 --> 01:58:19,281
We

1398
01:58:20,742 --> 01:58:35,300
understand what they're looking for in projects, it is our goal that this project will be legally advertised to site plan review will go in front of them, they will look at it, that will not be the first time they've ever seen it because it will be all over public meetings in the press.

1399
01:58:35,740 --> 01:58:40,663
and they'll say, right, this is perfect, we're good with this, let's go, keep going.

1400
01:58:41,424 --> 01:58:44,146
We have had projects in and out in one meeting.

1401
01:58:45,206 --> 01:58:55,633
When the developer is good, when the architects are good, I'll tell you Herb Chambers was in and out in one meeting because their stuff, they knew what we were looking for and they provided it up and we were done.

1402
01:58:56,654 --> 01:59:01,157
It's only when it takes many, many iterations to site plan review

1403
01:59:01,857 --> 01:59:03,158
could drag out for months.

1404
01:59:03,698 --> 01:59:06,979
It's usually not because we're dragging it out.

1405
01:59:08,599 --> 01:59:09,880
So I don't see any.

1406
01:59:10,040 --> 01:59:11,840
We are keeping this as of a scale.

1407
01:59:11,960 --> 01:59:15,061
It's not on state roads that require MEPA permits.

1408
01:59:16,702 --> 01:59:19,563
So we do think this will be able to move quickly.

1409
01:59:19,583 --> 01:59:20,503
It actually

1410
01:59:21,003 --> 01:59:34,121
Chapter 91 is why one of the reasons why clipper ship connector took so long, and we have a couple other shared use pads projects that we're doing that D O T that have been hung up in state permitting projects along the river.

1411
01:59:34,141 --> 01:59:35,123
That's

1412
01:59:35,992 --> 01:59:38,074
really get bogged down by state permits.

1413
01:59:38,935 --> 01:59:40,856
So, and ones on state roads.

1414
01:59:41,196 --> 01:59:50,344
So we're hoping, I don't see any reasons why this should get bogged down other than now us negotiating the terms of this lease and the details of this project.

1415
01:59:51,045 --> 01:59:53,547
So we're, they asked if we could meet next week.

1416
01:59:53,587 --> 01:59:55,268
Do we have a meeting next week, this week?

1417
01:59:56,509 --> 01:59:57,050
We're setting it.

1418
01:59:57,690 --> 01:59:59,672
Yeah, we're talking to them.

1419
01:59:59,732 --> 02:00:06,318
So Sal, our economic development director, has been talking to them, trying to get a meeting set up within the next week to get this ball rolling.

1420
02:00:06,638 --> 02:00:07,459
I'm glad to hear that.

1421
02:00:07,579 --> 02:00:17,228
I think it's really important that folks at home know that, at least on our side, we are really coordinating all our efforts, the zoning effort,

1422
02:00:17,908 --> 02:00:23,591
the Medford Square projects to make sure that things can happen as quickly as possible on our side.

1423
02:00:23,811 --> 02:00:27,553
And the state permits, that's a whole other world.

1424
02:00:27,574 --> 02:00:29,094
Chapter 91, that's a whole other world.

1425
02:00:30,395 --> 02:00:43,022
I think you've also addressed, I've also been hearing quite a lot about banks and businesses that, at least in our last Medford Square report, were labeled as

1426
02:00:44,803 --> 02:00:47,625
you know, we have a lot of these, we don't need that many more, you know.

1427
02:00:49,487 --> 02:01:07,420
I think a question that residents have brought up is that instead of, why not, instead of banning it outright because we, you know, we still want these businesses here, why shouldn't we in zoning put something like a special permit process for businesses that we see a lot of?

1428
02:01:07,601 --> 02:01:07,681
And

1429
02:01:08,421 --> 02:01:13,205
I think this is a great, with a lot of folks watching at home, this might be a forum for you to address that question.

1430
02:01:13,225 --> 02:01:13,425
Right.

1431
02:01:13,545 --> 02:01:16,587
And so some of that is what you're allowed to do and not allowed to do.

1432
02:01:17,008 --> 02:01:22,692
So a special permit can't be completely arbitrary around like, oh, we have too many.

1433
02:01:22,772 --> 02:01:26,675
Now you can't be the 10th one, but you could have been the 5th one, right?

1434
02:01:27,055 --> 02:01:28,496
You can't quite use it for that.

1435
02:01:28,877 --> 02:01:30,598
You could use it to say, well, you know,

1436
02:01:31,238 --> 02:01:36,460
Small is okay, bigger is not, or we want them on the side streets, not the main.

1437
02:01:37,720 --> 02:01:42,282
They're more used for uses where they could be difficult on the neighbors.

1438
02:01:42,662 --> 02:01:49,624
The problem is banks are boring, if I might, but they're not, like we were saying, actually bad neighbors.

1439
02:01:49,984 --> 02:01:54,186
The bad part is that it's dark in the evening and it's not good for economic development.

1440
02:01:54,566 --> 02:01:58,168
but they're not loud and rowdy and they don't stink.

1441
02:01:58,408 --> 02:02:02,550
And, you know, like they're not that kind of a problem neighbor.

1442
02:02:03,450 --> 02:02:05,491
And there are such things as banking deserts.

1443
02:02:05,611 --> 02:02:08,672
There are places where people can't get easily to a bank.

1444
02:02:09,033 --> 02:02:12,174
I think we don't see it as much now that so much is online.

1445
02:02:12,894 --> 02:02:19,117
But the reality is that people who need to walk to a bank need to walk to a bank or like to walk to a bank.

1446
02:02:20,478 --> 02:02:20,618
And

1447
02:02:21,256 --> 02:02:23,878
you don't want to accidentally then create a banking desert.

1448
02:02:24,198 --> 02:02:33,526
I think that if we said like, we don't allow banks in our business districts, some bank is going to come along and try to take us to court over that.

1449
02:02:33,666 --> 02:02:36,128
Like it just feels like an overreach.

1450
02:02:36,748 --> 02:02:42,272
So our goal is to, we do recruit, Sal actively recruits businesses.

1451
02:02:42,352 --> 02:02:43,593
We meet with businesses.

1452
02:02:43,974 --> 02:02:50,659
I will tell you that we do not have trouble with businesses not wanting to come to Medford, either Medford Square or any of the other districts.

1453
02:02:51,219 --> 02:02:55,680
I don't remember which meeting I said this in recently, or Sal said it.

1454
02:02:56,920 --> 02:03:06,622
There are a couple of spaces where we have very long-term empty spaces, and those spaces are not empty because nobody wants to rent them.

1455
02:03:07,182 --> 02:03:12,664
They're empty because what the landlords are asking is too much, or they're not responsive.

1456
02:03:13,204 --> 02:03:18,325
And we have tried to get in touch with these landlords and try and work with them, and they don't want to hear from us.

1457
02:03:19,105 --> 02:03:28,027
Um, but we have businesses that absolutely want to move into west medford and medford square to all over medford We don't have trouble with that piece of it.

1458
02:03:28,427 --> 02:03:48,352
We've actually been working with some real estate agents And so we encourage you if you know businesses that want to come to medford to talk to sal because also What we have been doing is we are sometimes aware of businesses that might be willing to lease their space or might be willing to move Or downsize and let someone else come in there and they're not actively on the market

1459
02:03:49,252 --> 02:03:52,514
And so sometimes we're able to make some of those pairings up as well.

1460
02:03:53,395 --> 02:03:54,636
So that's really exciting.

1461
02:03:54,656 --> 02:03:57,598
Like, you might have noticed the new pinball parlor in Medford Square.

1462
02:03:57,618 --> 02:04:00,600
That space there, that was not on the market.

1463
02:04:01,160 --> 02:04:07,504
That was the landlord deciding that he wanted to bring that business in and let deep cuts expand like that.

1464
02:04:08,185 --> 02:04:14,649
So we are also aware of some of these opportunities that we'll try and bring businesses in and do some matchmaking.

1465
02:04:15,990 --> 02:04:17,051
And we have staff to do it now.

1466
02:04:18,112 --> 02:04:18,772
Thank you so much.

1467
02:04:18,893 --> 02:04:28,319
I think again, if there's anything that we can help with, you know this for at least the City Council, I know the City Council is very supportive.

1468
02:04:28,659 --> 02:04:31,461
And you know, we'll have questions.

1469
02:04:31,942 --> 02:04:36,145
I should have asked for the surplus vote tonight.

1470
02:04:37,145 --> 02:04:38,727
We're in such a good mood.

1471
02:04:39,427 --> 02:04:46,275
Look, I mean, I think any time that we can get together and talk about these issues, I know residents really do appreciate it.

1472
02:04:46,295 --> 02:04:57,528
You know, even if we're asking questions that are just clarifying points that we know a little bit about, I think it becomes a great moment for our city to get that information.

1473
02:04:58,208 --> 02:04:59,390
and we have our office.

1474
02:04:59,850 --> 02:05:01,372
People don't have to speak to me directly.

1475
02:05:01,732 --> 02:05:02,633
Call our main line.

1476
02:05:02,713 --> 02:05:03,634
Talk to our staff.

1477
02:05:03,774 --> 02:05:09,159
Several more of the staff are here to talk you to you this evening on other topics, so I don't want to belabor this too much.

1478
02:05:09,500 --> 02:05:12,563
But we also particularly have new economic development planner.

1479
02:05:13,443 --> 02:05:16,245
who is part of her role is going to be helping small businesses.

1480
02:05:16,645 --> 02:05:25,071
So if small businesses aren't sure how to navigate City Hall, that's part of what she's going to do is help them figure out this process as well.

1481
02:05:25,411 --> 02:05:29,733
And I'll just also let you all know that we hired a new housing planner who started this week as well.

1482
02:05:29,934 --> 02:05:30,394
Last week?

1483
02:05:30,834 --> 02:05:32,095
Last week was her first week.

1484
02:05:32,575 --> 02:05:33,736
So, Medford resident.

1485
02:05:33,896 --> 02:05:34,496
Very exciting.

1486
02:05:34,877 --> 02:05:35,157
Awesome.

1487
02:05:35,197 --> 02:05:35,877
Thank you so much.

1488
02:05:37,538 --> 02:05:37,818
Great.

1489
02:05:37,939 --> 02:05:38,579
Thank you all.

1490
02:05:38,599 --> 02:05:41,641
Yeah, and I think, you know, we're going to

1491
02:05:42,420 --> 02:05:55,055
try to go as big as we can and make sure that whatever we do either enables some of the longer term things that we talked about or at least doesn't block them and sets us up for those future discussions.

1492
02:05:55,135 --> 02:05:59,100
So I'm really looking forward to continuing to work on that with you guys.

1493
02:06:00,357 --> 02:06:04,680
And I know we'll have another update for the council, hopefully, you know, next few months.

1494
02:06:05,320 --> 02:06:06,081
Thank you very much.

1495
02:06:06,421 --> 02:06:06,841
Thank you.

1496
02:06:07,062 --> 02:06:12,265
And there's a motion from councils are to receive in place on file, seconded by seconded by Councillor Callahan.

1497
02:06:12,285 --> 02:06:20,871
Do we have any further discussion by members of the council or members of the public, either in person or raise your hand on Zoom?

1498
02:06:22,192 --> 02:06:23,733
If one person on Zoom.

1499
02:06:26,575 --> 02:06:28,716
Marie, name and address for the record, please.

1500
02:06:28,736 --> 02:06:29,417
You have three minutes.

1501
02:06:29,980 --> 02:06:33,605
Hi, it's Marie Izzo, Pilgrim Road, Medford Mass.

1502
02:06:34,105 --> 02:06:40,553
I'm wondering, is it too early for me to ask about what level of affordability will be available for renters?

1503
02:06:41,114 --> 02:06:43,377
And these are all rentals, correct?

1504
02:06:44,553 --> 02:06:55,223
The units are all rentals and the proposal was 20% of the units affordable at 80% AMI, but that's not the final answer.

1505
02:06:56,324 --> 02:07:05,212
And there's either potential for more units, if it's a bigger project, maybe more units at that level, or maybe a change in the distribution of the affordability requirements.

1506
02:07:07,118 --> 02:07:10,079
I don't know if you have anything more on that, Director Hunt.

1507
02:07:10,399 --> 02:07:13,940
Great, no, we're good.

1508
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:15,440
Any more questions, Marie, on that?

1509
02:07:15,740 --> 02:07:33,985
Well, just, I mean, if you could clarify exactly what is 80% of AMI for rental, either for, so that people have an idea of what a rent would be like as an affordable rent, because I don't think we know that as a public.

1510
02:07:35,157 --> 02:07:35,658
Absolutely.

1511
02:07:35,719 --> 02:07:37,302
So sorry to use that term.

1512
02:07:37,322 --> 02:07:44,459
80% of the area median income, and that changes depending on the household size, and it looks like Director Hunt

1513
02:07:45,168 --> 02:07:46,609
And it also changes every year.

1514
02:07:47,489 --> 02:07:49,370
But Director Hunt has the income.

1515
02:07:49,490 --> 02:07:55,572
And then just before you read the income, I believe the way it works is it can be a maximum of 30% of your income.

1516
02:07:55,612 --> 02:07:56,533
But I'll just let you.

1517
02:07:57,173 --> 02:08:04,356
So to be clear, when we talk about affordable units, we're not talking about naturally occurring affordable.

1518
02:08:04,576 --> 02:08:08,937
They're not just cheap, but they're actually deed restricted, which means that they get

1519
02:08:10,458 --> 02:08:17,581
and the city asks for them to be eligible for the state housing inventory of deed restricted affordable units.

1520
02:08:19,221 --> 02:08:21,622
And so along with that, they will be lotteried out.

1521
02:08:22,142 --> 02:08:27,704
We, as part of the lottery, you have to be income qualified.

1522
02:08:28,285 --> 02:08:34,347
We have the ability to ask for a certain amount of those to be designated for Medford residents first.

1523
02:08:35,107 --> 02:08:38,728
and the state has to approve the amount that we want to be.

1524
02:08:38,788 --> 02:08:43,048
If we want any of it to be special for Medford residents, the state has to approve that.

1525
02:08:43,608 --> 02:08:58,751
We have been successfully justifying and getting approved for the last at least five years, but possibly 10 years, 70% of the spaces to be for Medford residents first, as opposed to a fully public lottery.

1526
02:09:00,271 --> 02:09:02,292
So we will be pursuing that as well.

1527
02:09:04,112 --> 02:09:11,294
and then a deed restricted affordable unit, you do have to prove your income qualifications, you have to, it also looks at your assets.

1528
02:09:11,974 --> 02:09:27,338
The 2025, so 80%, so this is also by region, and, sorry, I thought I had up, we're in the area called the Quincy area, right?

1529
02:09:27,558 --> 02:09:29,459
Yep, let me just check and make sure.

1530
02:09:31,005 --> 02:09:34,909
So in Middlesex County right now, the 80% limit this year, if you're a household of one, is $92,000.

1531
02:09:34,989 --> 02:09:37,913
If you're a household of four, it's $132,300, is what 80% of area median income is.

1532
02:09:48,925 --> 02:09:58,431
the idea is that if 100% of median income would be the median income in the area, and this is 80% of that, so you could then go down.

1533
02:09:58,451 --> 02:10:00,292
50% would be people who have lower incomes.

1534
02:10:00,312 --> 02:10:02,634
30% would be very low income.

1535
02:10:03,515 --> 02:10:06,536
So those numbers are not very low in our area.

1536
02:10:07,517 --> 02:10:16,180
So we're not really addressing the issue of what people can actually afford based on income in Medford, is that correct?

1537
02:10:16,860 --> 02:10:26,443
That does come into it that you actually have to be in an income band because if you make too little then you can't afford your share unless you have a Section 8 voucher.

1538
02:10:26,863 --> 02:10:29,304
So Section 8 vouchers will allow you

1539
02:10:29,824 --> 02:10:35,252
to then they will subsidize you up to a certain up to market rate.

1540
02:10:35,752 --> 02:10:43,623
Whereas if you just are an affordable unit, then you must make enough money such that the rent is not more than 30% of your income.

1541
02:10:46,246 --> 02:10:50,489
And I will tell you that Medford then monitors all of these.

1542
02:10:50,549 --> 02:10:53,130
We spot check all the affordable units every year.

1543
02:10:53,190 --> 02:10:54,771
It's part of the housing planner's job.

1544
02:10:55,572 --> 02:11:06,118
And if those buildings that have affordable units want to raise the rent on the affordable units, then we actually have to approve those rent raises.

1545
02:11:06,178 --> 02:11:09,660
We can't unreasonably deny rent raises.

1546
02:11:10,460 --> 02:11:18,202
But we also will review them and make sure that they're reasonable so people aren't getting hit with really large rental raises.

1547
02:11:18,222 --> 02:11:20,663
I'm going to look back and say, did I get that good enough?

1548
02:11:20,683 --> 02:11:21,723
OK.

1549
02:11:22,243 --> 02:11:26,324
Teresa was doing the rental verifications for us for a while, so.

1550
02:11:27,604 --> 02:11:38,567
I think, Marie, to your larger question, like the question of what is something that a person can afford to rent is part of the discussion of like,

1551
02:11:39,545 --> 02:11:41,407
Well, 80% of AMI is very high.

1552
02:11:41,447 --> 02:11:49,274
Should we look at 50% of AMI or 30% of AMI, and that would pretty significantly reduce the deed-restricted rent amounts.

1553
02:11:50,195 --> 02:11:55,721
The problem is that it also reduces the revenue, and that reduces the ability to finance the project.

1554
02:11:57,282 --> 02:12:12,199
and because of how you know we're doing this we're getting public benefits because we're leasing the land and that is a portion of the cost but a huge portion of the cost of housing is the construction cost and the state does not

1555
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:16,162
Certainly the federal government and state government do not provide money for us to do that.

1556
02:12:16,182 --> 02:12:21,065
They also don't allow cities to, for example, take out bonds to fund the construction of housing.

1557
02:12:23,347 --> 02:12:29,211
That maybe could be a choice that the city could say, if that was an option afforded to us, we could maybe try to be a part of financing this project.

1558
02:12:29,271 --> 02:12:30,912
But the state doesn't allow us to do that.

1559
02:12:32,013 --> 02:12:37,276
So we're kind of reliant, again, around financing

1560
02:12:40,209 --> 02:12:52,076
But if it is leased, as opposed to having to purchase the land, I would assume that the developer will be making plenty of money to be able to then, you know,

1561
02:12:53,340 --> 02:12:55,221
give people the opportunity.

1562
02:12:55,241 --> 02:12:59,565
You know, we have like no workforce housing, which is what we need the most.

1563
02:13:00,225 --> 02:13:02,327
And we don't seem to be addressing that at all.

1564
02:13:02,347 --> 02:13:06,690
And again, this is a lease, this is not a purchase.

1565
02:13:08,111 --> 02:13:16,557
So I just don't understand why we can't, you know, go sort of at a more deeper level and really address the needs of the community.

1566
02:13:17,838 --> 02:13:20,099
It's definitely going to be part of the conversation.

1567
02:13:20,119 --> 02:13:25,942
The lease payment, I think, proposed by Transom is about a million dollars a year.

1568
02:13:27,483 --> 02:13:35,627
Which is nothing compared to the cost of land to anyone else other than a developer like this.

1569
02:13:37,088 --> 02:13:38,769
So that's a concern for me.

1570
02:13:39,590 --> 02:13:41,110
I mean, I think we'll have to look at the

1571
02:13:43,379 --> 02:13:46,860
I mean, there's a financial proposal that's part of the request for proposal.

1572
02:13:48,501 --> 02:13:51,462
We're not doing this to give the developer a windfall.

1573
02:13:51,502 --> 02:13:52,662
That's not the intent of this.

1574
02:13:53,883 --> 02:14:03,346
But the purchase cost of the land versus the lease cost of the land versus as a proportion of the cost of the project is smaller than you would think.

1575
02:14:03,406 --> 02:14:05,786
The land is not half the cost of the project.

1576
02:14:06,747 --> 02:14:10,348
The construction costs are the vast majority of the costs, at least from

1577
02:14:10,368 --> 02:14:12,469
No, no, I totally understand that.

1578
02:14:12,809 --> 02:14:13,829
I totally understand that.

1579
02:14:14,129 --> 02:14:24,633
But private people are spending much more than this developer is for that level of land with the number of units that they're going to be able to construct there.

1580
02:14:25,493 --> 02:14:35,677
And I would assume this is all luxury housing except for what we're calling affordable, which isn't affordable at all for Medford folk, anyway, from what I gather.

1581
02:14:37,668 --> 02:14:43,573
It is 25%, you know, it's 20% affordable.

1582
02:14:43,693 --> 02:14:46,796
It's 25% more affordable units that are required by the inclusionary zoning.

1583
02:14:48,077 --> 02:14:48,778
We've been going back and forth.

1584
02:14:48,798 --> 02:14:49,318
No, I understand.

1585
02:14:49,358 --> 02:15:04,772
I'm just speaking to the actual income of one person making almost $100,000 and, you know, getting that benefit to be, you know, and people that are making $50,000, which are the people in this city.

1586
02:15:06,384 --> 02:15:11,368
Not being able to afford to live here, which is the big issue that we have in this city.

1587
02:15:11,888 --> 02:15:15,271
It's not about whether or not we're going to be able to build anything or not.

1588
02:15:15,371 --> 02:15:21,896
It's more like we can't afford to keep our children, you know, housed here one way or the other.

1589
02:15:22,696 --> 02:15:29,401
you know, whether it's to be able to buy or to be able to rent, you know, so they're having to go elsewhere.

1590
02:15:29,701 --> 02:15:36,626
And I think that's key, regardless of sort of what, you know, the goals are related to, you know, the developers.

1591
02:15:36,986 --> 02:15:38,187
And that's a big concern.

1592
02:15:39,468 --> 02:15:43,831
Yeah, I just I do want to let some other people go, Marie, and I'm always happy to.

1593
02:15:44,489 --> 02:15:45,610
I'm always happy to talk about it more.

1594
02:15:45,670 --> 02:15:51,055
And I think just the thing I would say is the affordable housing piece was a big component of the proposal.

1595
02:15:52,196 --> 02:15:57,721
It's going to be a big proponent, like component of the negotiation.

1596
02:15:57,741 --> 02:16:03,807
And, you know, we're going to do our best as part of the I hear you.

1597
02:16:03,927 --> 02:16:05,349
I just don't think it's efficient.

1598
02:16:05,889 --> 02:16:06,269
That's all.

1599
02:16:06,430 --> 02:16:06,730
That's all.

1600
02:16:06,750 --> 02:16:07,511
Thank you.

1601
02:16:07,911 --> 02:16:08,351
Thank you.

1602
02:16:13,305 --> 02:16:14,826
I'm going to go to Paul Garrity.

1603
02:16:14,946 --> 02:16:16,588
Paul, name and address for the record.

1604
02:16:16,608 --> 02:16:18,069
And you'll have three minutes.

1605
02:16:22,812 --> 02:16:23,293
Good evening.

1606
02:16:23,433 --> 02:16:24,894
My name is Paul Garrity.

1607
02:16:24,914 --> 02:16:26,795
I live in 40 Cedar Road in Bedford.

1608
02:16:27,356 --> 02:16:29,778
And I kind of want to continue Ms.

1609
02:16:29,918 --> 02:16:31,619
Izzo's statements there.

1610
02:16:32,320 --> 02:16:37,664
My question is, is that does the project have a specific revenue plan?

1611
02:16:38,545 --> 02:16:40,466
And I think it ties into the previous question.

1612
02:16:41,407 --> 02:16:42,828
Say, what kind of money do we need

1613
02:16:43,596 --> 02:16:45,477
to support the objective.

1614
02:16:45,517 --> 02:16:47,578
The objective is to increase affordable housing.

1615
02:16:48,058 --> 02:16:52,940
You know, what is the revenue stream that we're going to be working with over the life of the lease?

1616
02:16:53,801 --> 02:17:05,386
And my question is, is that, can someone talk a little bit more about what is the revenue plan or what will be the revenue plan for this project going forward?

1617
02:17:05,486 --> 02:17:05,766
Thank you.

1618
02:17:07,126 --> 02:17:07,586
Thank you.

1619
02:17:08,167 --> 02:17:13,149
I can go to a director, but there is a financing plan that's part of the proposal.

1620
02:17:13,169 --> 02:17:33,300
It outlines in pretty significant detail what the proponent expects to receive in rents, both from the affordable units of the not affordable units, the market rate units, how those are coming in over time.

1621
02:17:33,880 --> 02:17:35,041
There is a and it goes out

1622
02:17:36,610 --> 02:17:38,473
at least 30 years, I think longer than that.

1623
02:17:38,494 --> 02:17:43,382
I don't know if you want to talk a little bit more about the specific financial proposal.

1624
02:17:44,796 --> 02:17:49,317
I did not prepare stuff on it, and I don't want to misspeak on it.

1625
02:17:49,437 --> 02:18:05,120
We did have FXM associates review their financial proposal and their financing to make sure that they agreed that this was sufficient, that they were going to recoup enough profit in order to put back into this to maintain these buildings.

1626
02:18:05,520 --> 02:18:08,040
To be clear, it's not the city's financing plan.

1627
02:18:08,600 --> 02:18:11,861
We are not getting the income to build affordable housing.

1628
02:18:12,221 --> 02:18:15,463
the developer is going to be building and managing the housing on this.

1629
02:18:15,864 --> 02:18:19,366
There will be linkage payments to the city as part of this.

1630
02:18:19,426 --> 02:18:29,153
There will be building permit fees, and there will be taxes, new growth in addition to annual lease payments to the city.

1631
02:18:29,813 --> 02:18:32,035
Yeah, and I mean, I think the easiest

1632
02:18:33,002 --> 02:18:58,719
answer to the question on the financing plan is if the developer can, I mean, subject to having the equity and the banks, you know, the financing to do it, if the developer can build more market rate units and they can provide more public benefits, whether that's more affordable units or other public benefits or affordable units at a deeper level of affordability, but that's kind of the, we're still in the, um,

1633
02:19:00,376 --> 02:19:09,943
really tough catch-22 situation here where this is privately financed and it's privately financed by private finance institutions that are seeking a profit.

1634
02:19:10,003 --> 02:19:12,785
It is not a publicly financed project.

1635
02:19:12,925 --> 02:19:23,493
By leasing the land we're getting some more public benefit because of how we're doing it because we're we are a stakeholder but it's different than

1636
02:19:24,670 --> 02:19:47,037
say if we were having a non-profit developer trying to help us finance this and having the money for it or especially if there was you know government financing available public financing or funding available that would be a completely different conversation so it's essentially a version of what we do with our inclusionary zoning on private land but just somewhat

1637
02:19:48,356 --> 02:19:52,818
improved in a sense because it's also a lease of this public land.

1638
02:19:52,838 --> 02:19:55,299
I don't know if you want to add to that at all.

1639
02:19:55,820 --> 02:19:56,280
Um, okay.

1640
02:19:57,180 --> 02:20:02,703
Uh, Paul, um, I'm just going to go to council.

1641
02:20:02,743 --> 02:20:08,926
My question though, is that, uh, what I'm concerned is that if one of our goals is to increase affordable housing,

1642
02:20:09,723 --> 02:20:21,887
Is the final plan going to be such that it can reflect carrying those costs as well as the maintenance of the buildings and all the associated costs with taking care of them?

1643
02:20:22,487 --> 02:20:35,231
I think my concern here is that if the major point here was to get affordable housing here, I think the revenue plan needs to deal with that directly as well as ancillary costs to maintain the buildings for the next number of years.

1644
02:20:37,321 --> 02:20:37,441
Right.

1645
02:20:37,521 --> 02:20:38,462
And that is the developer.

1646
02:20:38,602 --> 02:20:41,145
And that's that's the developers financing plan.

1647
02:20:41,225 --> 02:20:54,698
So if they can have more affordable housing, you know, if they can get the equity to do that, then more more or deeper, more affordable units or units at a deeper affordability or both would be on the table.

1648
02:21:01,375 --> 02:21:01,595
Thank you.

1649
02:21:01,615 --> 02:21:09,264
I really appreciate the constituent who is bringing up the specifics of the affordable housing.

1650
02:21:09,284 --> 02:21:17,974
I just wanted to make a short comment, which is that if you actually run the numbers, I will say I was a little surprised that 80% of AMI is 92,000.

1651
02:21:18,014 --> 02:21:18,915
That's higher than I thought.

1652
02:21:22,098 --> 02:21:28,341
And if you run the numbers at 92,000, 30% of that per month is 2,300.

1653
02:21:28,922 --> 02:21:31,543
And I assume that's one person.

1654
02:21:31,683 --> 02:21:32,623
So it'd be a one bedroom.

1655
02:21:33,224 --> 02:21:44,870
I'm making a guess because between 92 and 132K, which you said was one person and four person, 80% of AMI, making a guess for two people that it's around 108.

1656
02:21:45,050 --> 02:21:47,471
I don't know if that's accurate, but something like that.

1657
02:21:49,011 --> 02:21:52,373
that would that would be around like 2700 a month for a two bed.

1658
02:21:52,393 --> 02:22:00,395
I'm just like actually running the numbers and these numbers don't, to me appear to be much different from market rate.

1659
02:22:00,895 --> 02:22:03,696
They are significantly below market rate for new construction.

1660
02:22:04,657 --> 02:22:07,238
Well, hang on, hang on.

1661
02:22:08,158 --> 02:22:12,980
So and I understand that you're saying market rate for new construction.

1662
02:22:13,640 --> 02:22:13,780
So

1663
02:22:15,690 --> 02:22:36,077
I just want us to be sensitive to the fact that if this is close to market rate for a lot of our existing housing, then making, calling this affordable when it's new construction, like, I just want us to be sensitive to this idea that like, you know.

1664
02:22:36,857 --> 02:22:39,558
I think a lot of people say affordable, they say small a affordable.

1665
02:22:40,366 --> 02:22:45,393
And this is big a affordable it's legally, the definition of subsidized housing inventory affordable.

1666
02:22:45,694 --> 02:22:45,894
Sure.

1667
02:22:46,115 --> 02:22:51,703
And, and I think that is in fact what I'm bringing up which is, I think that people in the city want

1668
02:22:53,175 --> 02:22:55,016
colloquially affordable housing, right?

1669
02:22:55,376 --> 02:22:58,618
They don't want something that fits the legal definition of affordable housing.

1670
02:22:58,998 --> 02:23:03,940
If it's not actually creating more housing in our city, that is gonna be affordable for people.

1671
02:23:03,960 --> 02:23:11,904
I mean, even at 80% of AMI, let alone what the constituent was mentioning of people who aren't at 80% AMI.

1672
02:23:12,344 --> 02:23:18,387
Like I hope that we can consider having some steps or something, that's all.

1673
02:23:18,887 --> 02:23:35,794
And I know it's a conversation, but I think actually looking at the numbers and being open with the public about what numbers we are looking at and whether we're creating lowercase a, colloquially understood to be affordable housing, I think is an important discussion.

1674
02:23:36,474 --> 02:23:40,576
So part of it is there is a housing crisis, and this is exactly the definition.

1675
02:23:40,976 --> 02:23:44,357
You'd be stunned at how expensive units are these days.

1676
02:23:45,298 --> 02:23:48,399
But one of the theories is that when you build new housing,

1677
02:23:48,913 --> 02:23:58,296
The people who are in the older housing and can afford the new housing will move into it, and that will free up spaces in the older housing for people.

1678
02:23:58,656 --> 02:24:04,058
Now, the hope is that those don't then get snatched up and renovated and turned into expensive housing as well.

1679
02:24:04,558 --> 02:24:17,982
It's one of the things that we're actually hoping to see with the tough storm, where that's gonna be moving approximately 650 juniors and seniors out of housing, mostly in Medford and Somerville, into there, and that's gonna free up

1680
02:24:19,379 --> 02:24:23,060
run down cheap housing, because that's where the students are living these days.

1681
02:24:23,581 --> 02:24:30,303
And we're hoping that this will become more available to residents who need lower cost housing, for example.

1682
02:24:30,363 --> 02:24:39,227
But that's the idea, that you build new stuff, the people in the older buildings move into the new buildings, and then the older buildings are like, oh no, we have nobody to live here.

1683
02:24:39,347 --> 02:24:42,308
And so then they keep the rents lower to bring people in.

1684
02:24:42,568 --> 02:24:47,150
But because of the housing crisis, we are just seeing people are snatching up everything.

1685
02:24:48,526 --> 02:25:04,155
And I and I don't disagree that like we also have a very specific issue in Medford which is we have a lot of older folks, we have the largest of my understanding from the Senior Center, and the Council on Aging is that we have the largest proportion sort of cohort of seniors that we have ever had.

1686
02:25:05,135 --> 02:25:08,597
And a lot of them, especially I've talked to tons of them they live in.

1687
02:25:10,379 --> 02:25:18,029
They live in a four or five bedroom home and they're by themselves or with two people and they don't actually even want that, but there's nowhere in Medford to go.

1688
02:25:18,069 --> 02:25:21,194
So I appreciate that this will resolve that issue.

1689
02:25:21,755 --> 02:25:24,779
But I think creating affordable housing is its own

1690
02:25:25,620 --> 02:25:45,437
question, and that I would love for the city council and the planning department and the mayor and everyone to sort of grapple with in a real way, that I hope we aren't just creating more housing and hoping that that theoretically resolves a lot of our problems, but that we actually make some efforts to create

1691
02:25:46,298 --> 02:25:51,279
affordable housing in the different variety of ways that it can be and I don't necessarily mean create as in built.

1692
02:25:51,659 --> 02:26:07,804
I just mean that, you know, whether that's the rural community land trust whether that's the affordable housing trust with, you know, there's many avenues I think doing our best to create housing that is lowercase a affordable is something that I hope we can

1693
02:26:09,592 --> 02:26:25,497
And one of the things we asked for in this was we said we're looking for housing we're not looking, looking for luxury housing, looking for smaller units we're looking for things targeted at seniors and targeted at for example graduate students young professionals from Tufts.

1694
02:26:26,037 --> 02:26:28,539
Tufts is gonna start running a shuttle to Medford Square.

1695
02:26:28,599 --> 02:26:33,523
I don't know if everybody heard that, but with the opening of the new dorm, they've committed to a shuttle to Medford Square.

1696
02:26:34,124 --> 02:26:39,849
That is also something that would help young staff at Tufts be able to live here.

1697
02:26:40,289 --> 02:26:49,157
And so we've asked them to think about more smaller units rather than fewer big luxury units, because that's what we need to see more of in the city.

1698
02:26:50,238 --> 02:26:52,780
And we push that with developers fairly frequently.

1699
02:26:53,508 --> 02:26:56,530
And we did solicit a lot of different bids.

1700
02:26:56,810 --> 02:27:03,155
If a nonprofit housing developer had bid on this, we'd be in a different conversation, probably, because it's probably who we would have gone with.

1701
02:27:03,715 --> 02:27:09,759
And they looked at it, and some of them did, in fact, attend the walkthrough, but they did not bid on it.

1702
02:27:10,320 --> 02:27:16,724
And I mean, I think you're completely right, and Marie's completely right, and others are completely right.

1703
02:27:19,408 --> 02:27:24,754
the market has failed, and the government is not intervening in the failure of the market.

1704
02:27:26,996 --> 02:27:32,802
And then the question is, do you do nothing and hope that a different government will set different rules?

1705
02:27:33,522 --> 02:27:38,768
Like, how much do you want to try to wait out like the public housing renaissance and the social housing renaissance in this country?

1706
02:27:40,359 --> 02:27:46,762
Or do you try to preserve as much existing naturally affordable housing as you can by at least trying to meet market demand.

1707
02:27:47,422 --> 02:27:51,864
And I think we're in a, in a difficult situation with that so like I completely agree.

1708
02:27:52,945 --> 02:27:57,207
And it's, as for me, many, you know, five years up here.

1709
02:27:58,500 --> 02:28:09,628
really hard that these kinds of decisions are put on us at this level of government because the state and federal government are completely ignoring and absent and in some cases making the situation a lot worse.

1710
02:28:11,389 --> 02:28:22,797
That's why I brought up like the if the state just allowed like us to use municipal bond rates that would open up some financing options here even if it wasn't like us actually paying back the bonds themselves just if the city could help

1711
02:28:23,682 --> 02:28:25,083
finance it at those rates, right?

1712
02:28:25,203 --> 02:28:32,229
Like that would be a game changer versus like these guys have to go out and find $200 million in financing at the current rates.

1713
02:28:32,349 --> 02:28:36,373
So it's tough and it's hard.

1714
02:28:38,214 --> 02:28:39,035
There's one more comment.

1715
02:28:40,836 --> 02:28:43,679
Molly, could you start your video before I let you speak?

1716
02:28:44,299 --> 02:28:49,764
All right, you seem to be a real person.

1717
02:28:49,784 --> 02:28:52,186
You're upside down, but I trust you're not gonna Zoom bomb me.

1718
02:28:56,024 --> 02:28:58,426
Molly, name and address for the record, you have three minutes.

1719
02:29:00,607 --> 02:29:03,729
Hi, Molly Dressel, 20 Hancock Street.

1720
02:29:04,070 --> 02:29:07,812
I'm sorry, can I turn my video off because I feel it's really distracting.

1721
02:29:07,852 --> 02:29:09,833
Yes, that was just a verification.

1722
02:29:09,853 --> 02:29:12,535
Okay, sorry about that.

1723
02:29:13,436 --> 02:29:19,360
Yeah, I've been living here for seven years, and I've been a Local 7 union ironworker for six of those years.

1724
02:29:20,761 --> 02:29:22,522
And I've never had a job opportunity in

1725
02:29:23,355 --> 02:29:23,976
Medford.

1726
02:29:24,076 --> 02:29:29,240
I've worked in the surrounding areas like Somerville High School, Union Square, Elwha Station.

1727
02:29:29,260 --> 02:29:32,342
I think there's something coming up in Everett.

1728
02:29:32,902 --> 02:29:41,749
And I know that in Medford we've done some steel building like the Great American Beer Hall and the Herb Chambers, but all has been non-union.

1729
02:29:41,769 --> 02:29:46,773
I know Tufts University is, the carpenters are picketing out there right now

1730
02:29:47,429 --> 02:29:49,210
and they're about to build all those dorms.

1731
02:29:50,151 --> 02:29:53,453
And I know that's not out to bid yet, but I'm doubting that it's going to go union.

1732
02:29:54,754 --> 02:30:02,740
So I guess I'm just here today to be a voice for the union members and advocate that these projects coming up prioritize union labor.

1733
02:30:03,901 --> 02:30:13,028
I'm recognizing that it usually comes at a higher price, but the unions like Local 7 are ensuring that the workers have proper training and certifications.

1734
02:30:13,737 --> 02:30:15,097
needed to do the work correctly.

1735
02:30:16,337 --> 02:30:18,378
Construction work is a dangerous trade.

1736
02:30:18,958 --> 02:30:24,259
The unions are fighting to secure fair wages for us and benefits without discrimination.

1737
02:30:24,279 --> 02:30:28,440
So it's all about protecting the workers and ensuring their safety.

1738
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:40,822
This includes utilizing the proper safety techniques and complying with OSHA, thereby making a safer job site for the workers and also the surrounding community while the construction is taking place.

1739
02:30:42,562 --> 02:30:53,508
I think rebuilding right around City Hall and using union labor would make a strong statement that Medford supports the unions and recognizes their importance, especially right now when work is really hard for us to come by.

1740
02:30:54,108 --> 02:31:03,953
So I'm just here to say that we're here, we need the work, we need to provide for our families, we have the skill and the proper training to get things done safely and efficiently.

1741
02:31:04,997 --> 02:31:12,260
And just a quick note on, I know that Alicia was saying a lot of the buildings are going to be wood and under five stories.

1742
02:31:12,440 --> 02:31:22,045
But a lot of other places smaller are also going for steel now for a very good reason of the long-term benefits.

1743
02:31:23,085 --> 02:31:26,287
It won't rot or warp like wood will.

1744
02:31:26,587 --> 02:31:29,388
It can better withstand natural disasters.

1745
02:31:29,688 --> 02:31:33,850
It's resistant to pests and the elements, especially being right by the water.

1746
02:31:34,833 --> 02:31:47,049
And for longevity purposes, it could also provide the ability to expand in the long term, maybe if you want to add on more stories to the existing, to the new buildings that you're making.

1747
02:31:47,950 --> 02:31:48,511
That's all I had.

1748
02:31:48,731 --> 02:31:49,051
Thank you.

1749
02:31:49,071 --> 02:31:51,895
Thank you, Molly.

1750
02:31:58,427 --> 02:32:03,130
And I know that's gonna be an issue that we try to balance as well as part of the project.

1751
02:32:04,952 --> 02:32:08,374
And we're gonna, do you have anything more you wanna add on that, Dr. Hunt?

1752
02:32:10,496 --> 02:32:13,578
I just say, I appreciate the comment and it's good to hear that.

1753
02:32:13,738 --> 02:32:18,362
And we will take that into account and discuss with the developers.

1754
02:32:19,182 --> 02:32:22,064
We would love some big, beautiful steel buildings, I can tell you that.

1755
02:32:22,805 --> 02:32:23,065
Yes.

1756
02:32:27,742 --> 02:32:33,825
All right, we had a motion to receive and place on file by Councilor Nazaro, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1757
02:32:35,705 --> 02:32:37,666
Councilor Scarpelli.

1758
02:32:37,686 --> 02:32:40,888
Can you share that with us?

1759
02:32:41,188 --> 02:32:41,868
Thanks.

1760
02:32:43,949 --> 02:32:44,449
I don't have it.

1761
02:32:44,549 --> 02:32:47,010
If you can share it with me, if you share with the clerk, actually.

1762
02:32:47,491 --> 02:32:47,891
Thank you.

1763
02:32:48,211 --> 02:32:50,152
It was very helpful to share with people.

1764
02:32:50,292 --> 02:32:50,652
Thank you.

1765
02:32:52,493 --> 02:32:55,094
On the motion, Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

1766
02:32:58,900 --> 02:32:59,500
Councilor Callahan.

1767
02:33:00,741 --> 02:33:01,582
Vice President Collins.

1768
02:33:01,902 --> 02:33:02,122
Yes.

1769
02:33:03,643 --> 02:33:04,364
Councilor Lazaro.

1770
02:33:04,384 --> 02:33:04,484
Yes.

1771
02:33:05,845 --> 02:33:06,745
Councilor Lemming is absent.

1772
02:33:07,626 --> 02:33:08,246
Councilor Scarpelli.

1773
02:33:08,266 --> 02:33:08,346
Yes.

1774
02:33:10,048 --> 02:33:10,528
Councilor Sang.

1775
02:33:10,548 --> 02:33:10,608
Yes.

1776
02:33:11,368 --> 02:33:11,949
President Behrs.

1777
02:33:12,049 --> 02:33:12,309
Yes.

1778
02:33:12,329 --> 02:33:15,691
16 affirmative, one absent, the motion passes.

1779
02:33:15,711 --> 02:33:17,813
25078, amendments to the parking ordinance, section 78173.

1780
02:33:17,853 --> 02:33:19,434
I don't know, Director Hunt, are you on any of this?

1781
02:33:28,674 --> 02:33:29,877
Okay, it's fine.

1782
02:33:33,684 --> 02:33:35,047
As a member of the Traffic Commission.

1783
02:33:36,302 --> 02:33:41,484
Yeah, so we had a, there was a committee of the whole meeting, the chief of staff talked about it.

1784
02:33:41,524 --> 02:33:57,549
This is a proposal to repeal an ordinance section on municipal employee and municipal business parking because the traffic commission is now putting in regulations around municipal parking to address the parking shortage at city hall and people parking at city hall for non-municipal business.

1785
02:33:58,169 --> 02:34:02,030
And the request is to repeal this ordinance so that there's no conflict

1786
02:34:02,590 --> 02:34:06,191
between the Traffic Commission regulations and the City Ordinance.

1787
02:34:07,371 --> 02:34:09,712
Is there anything else you'd want to add on that, Alicia?

1788
02:34:15,713 --> 02:34:19,894
If there are questions, I am familiar with this from the Traffic Commission, so I can answer it.

1789
02:34:20,174 --> 02:34:24,415
And I know that the Chief of Staff and the Parking Director talked about this with folks in Committee of the Whole.

1790
02:34:24,435 --> 02:34:25,515
I wasn't able to attend that meeting.

1791
02:34:26,115 --> 02:34:30,456
It's my first miss this year, but I wasn't able to be there.

1792
02:34:32,290 --> 02:34:37,613
Is there anything else that folks who were at that meeting want to add about the proposal or anything that I missed from the discussion at that meeting?

1793
02:34:37,633 --> 02:34:42,776
Okay.

1794
02:34:42,816 --> 02:34:44,437
President Burris.

1795
02:34:46,338 --> 02:34:47,379
President Council.

1796
02:34:47,419 --> 02:34:47,659
Yeah.

1797
02:34:47,879 --> 02:34:54,283
That's the biggest thing, people think when calls hang out, does this mean we're taking public parking away and we're not?

1798
02:34:54,664 --> 02:34:54,844
No.

1799
02:34:54,944 --> 02:34:58,386
So just so that's all this, it's pretty self-explanatory.

1800
02:34:58,426 --> 02:35:01,568
Yeah, it's actually in here pretty specifically about

1801
02:35:04,136 --> 02:35:07,979
The above changes allow the city to update the signage at City Hall and enforce parking restrictions.

1802
02:35:08,920 --> 02:35:14,766
Currently, we have commuters who are parking in the lot and using the bus or walking over to Harvard Vanguard.

1803
02:35:15,386 --> 02:35:26,316
So they're not using the Harvard Vanguard lot and they're not using the commuter lot, they're using City Hall and it's making it hard for employees and people who want to do business at City Hall to do business.

1804
02:35:26,556 --> 02:35:27,377
Vice President Collins.

1805
02:35:28,787 --> 02:35:33,230
Thank you president bears I think all of the important points have been stated already but I was present at this meeting.

1806
02:35:34,351 --> 02:35:49,403
Talked about it with Chief of Staff Nazarian and Director McDermond and they emphasized that this was really just a targeted change to make sure that visitors to City Hall and City Hall employees can access the parking that they need to go to City Hall and do business and go to their jobs.

1807
02:35:50,464 --> 02:36:14,146
not intended to be punitive and the committee did ask for a guarantee that it wouldn't just be all of a sudden tickets are being issued there's going to be a substantial you know informational period and warning period and issuing warnings before they start doing enforcement related to fines so really not intended to be punitive just want to make sure that people who need to park at city hall are able to do so and

1808
02:36:15,446 --> 02:36:21,189
the large amount of public parking that is next to that lot is still, for the moment, public parking.

1809
02:36:21,589 --> 02:36:21,889
Thank you.

1810
02:36:23,790 --> 02:36:24,170
Thank you.

1811
02:36:24,190 --> 02:36:25,651
Is there a motion to approve for first reading?

1812
02:36:27,271 --> 02:36:31,533
On the motion of Councilor saying to approve for first reading, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1813
02:36:32,994 --> 02:36:34,114
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1814
02:36:40,697 --> 02:36:41,277
Councilor Callahan.

1815
02:36:42,872 --> 02:36:43,713
Vice President Collins.

1816
02:36:43,973 --> 02:36:44,153
Yes.

1817
02:36:45,394 --> 02:36:46,314
Councilor Lazaro.

1818
02:36:47,836 --> 02:36:48,916
Councilor Lemming is absent.

1819
02:36:49,697 --> 02:36:50,417
Councilor Scarpelli.

1820
02:36:50,678 --> 02:36:50,898
Yes.

1821
02:36:51,558 --> 02:36:52,139
Councilor Sang.

1822
02:36:52,759 --> 02:36:53,359
President Paris.

1823
02:36:53,379 --> 02:36:55,981
Yes, 60 affirmative, one absent.

1824
02:36:56,001 --> 02:36:57,222
The motion passes.

1825
02:36:57,242 --> 02:36:58,963
25079 appropriation of free cash for car park.

1826
02:36:59,484 --> 02:37:00,264
Let's take both of you.

1827
02:37:00,284 --> 02:37:03,787
Let's talk about it all at once, even though there's two papers for car park.

1828
02:37:03,867 --> 02:37:05,388
I'm guessing it's for the same reason.

1829
02:37:06,208 --> 02:37:10,892
So we have an appropriation of free cash and a CPC appropriation for car park.

1830
02:37:12,369 --> 02:37:14,550
And then Teresa will just do the community garden piece when.

1831
02:37:14,610 --> 02:37:15,551
Yeah.

1832
02:37:15,751 --> 02:37:16,031
All right.

1833
02:37:16,692 --> 02:37:22,696
So we have from the mayor, a request for 65,000 contingency funding for phase two of the car park renovation.

1834
02:37:22,716 --> 02:37:27,780
And this is a funding match with the CPA is also a funding match.

1835
02:37:27,800 --> 02:37:30,122
So I'll go to a planner central.

1836
02:37:31,417 --> 02:37:31,557
Hi.

1837
02:37:31,717 --> 02:37:32,998
Thank you so much for having me.

1838
02:37:33,198 --> 02:37:33,999
Amanda Centella.

1839
02:37:34,079 --> 02:37:39,063
I work in the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability for the city, and I work on parks projects.

1840
02:37:39,323 --> 02:37:39,963
Good to see you all.

1841
02:37:41,505 --> 02:37:47,329
So I think everyone here is very familiar with the Carr Park project, but if you want me to go into more detail, just let me know.

1842
02:37:47,849 --> 02:37:52,092
We are within phase two of the renovation, which is currently underway.

1843
02:37:52,232 --> 02:37:59,358
We started construction in February, and that work will continue until the end of this calendar year.

1844
02:38:00,943 --> 02:38:17,976
Quick recap, it includes a lot of cool stuff, playground, dog park, two basketball courts, one is open air, one has a shade structure over top with solar panels, a skate park, a small splash pad, team and fitness areas and more.

1845
02:38:20,176 --> 02:38:26,440
What we're presenting tonight is a request for some contingency funding for the project.

1846
02:38:27,060 --> 02:38:29,962
So contingency funding is really important.

1847
02:38:30,663 --> 02:38:43,751
It allows for, as a project is underway, for the project team to make swift decisions about what to do when unforeseen issues arise or new conditions sort of present themselves.

1848
02:38:44,611 --> 02:38:55,856
It's considered a best practice to have, and I took a look at other projects of comparable scales in the city that were actually performed by the same contractor that we've done.

1849
02:38:57,416 --> 02:39:01,178
So, Gillis Field, Car Park Phase One, and McGlynn Playground.

1850
02:39:01,796 --> 02:39:05,839
and took a look at how much contingency funding we used on each of those projects.

1851
02:39:06,540 --> 02:39:11,504
It ranged a bit from like 2.3 to 4% of the total project budget.

1852
02:39:12,545 --> 02:39:27,257
And so this appropriation ask is in combination with the CPA ask to follow, plus contingency funds that we've already dedicated to the project from linkage funding would amount to about 3.6% of the project budget.

1853
02:39:27,377 --> 02:39:29,278
So kind of right within that range.

1854
02:39:31,322 --> 02:39:31,484
The.

1855
02:39:33,980 --> 02:39:42,447
Right now in the project, we're in the phase where we're underground, which in my experience is where you encounter kind of the most unknowns.

1856
02:39:43,468 --> 02:39:48,372
You know, we have city records and things like that, but sometimes you really don't know what's there until you dig into it.

1857
02:39:49,152 --> 02:40:01,082
Case in point, we found under our existing tennis and basketball courts, a set of full athletic courts from many years ago that we had to remove and demolish.

1858
02:40:02,296 --> 02:40:03,517
buried underneath the ground.

1859
02:40:03,797 --> 02:40:17,266
So, you know, you just run into some unknowns and having contingency funding is a surefire way to be able to address those needs in a timely way, and I keep mentioning timing because when construction is active.

1860
02:40:19,445 --> 02:40:20,286
Timing is key.

1861
02:40:21,507 --> 02:40:25,850
Sometimes delays of even a couple of days incur costs.

1862
02:40:26,651 --> 02:40:34,017
And a lot of it, the sequencing of this project, we have, as I listed out, so many wonderful things going into a compact space.

1863
02:40:34,237 --> 02:40:37,019
And so you have lots of different types of installments happening.

1864
02:40:37,620 --> 02:40:40,242
And that means you're scheduling a lot of different types of

1865
02:40:40,822 --> 02:40:43,824
Um, it work and cruise on the site.

1866
02:40:44,264 --> 02:40:50,468
And when you have a delay on one thing, it kind of has this ripple effect of delaying everything else.

1867
02:40:50,728 --> 02:40:58,133
So, um, I'll pause there and just see if folks have questions about the nature of the ask.

1868
02:40:58,553 --> 02:41:06,218
Um, the free cash request is for $65,000 and the following CPA request is as a match of 65,000 for 130,000 total.

1869
02:41:12,014 --> 02:41:13,495
Any questions from members of the council?

1870
02:41:13,515 --> 02:41:16,496
I just have one.

1871
02:41:16,796 --> 02:41:18,237
What was the contingency percentage?

1872
02:41:19,138 --> 02:41:21,319
If we didn't, like if we didn't approve this, what was the contingency?

1873
02:41:21,899 --> 02:41:32,785
If we didn't approve this, we had, let's see, so we already dedicated 46,000 to the project, which we have essentially expended at this point.

1874
02:41:32,865 --> 02:41:33,005
Okay.

1875
02:41:34,225 --> 02:41:34,926
And it would be 0.09%.

1876
02:41:34,966 --> 02:41:42,192
So a lot less than that 2.3 to 4, 2.6 to 4%.

1877
02:41:42,632 --> 02:41:46,816
Yes, 2.3 to 4% is the range of just comparable projects.

1878
02:41:47,316 --> 02:41:51,199
And if the contingency funds aren't used, then they go back to the source?

1879
02:41:51,419 --> 02:41:51,640
Yes.

1880
02:41:51,800 --> 02:41:54,382
And in this case, would they go evenly back to the source?

1881
02:41:54,502 --> 02:41:55,863
Or have you talked about that?

1882
02:41:55,883 --> 02:41:55,983
Yes.

1883
02:41:56,123 --> 02:41:57,404
So one of you want to speak?

1884
02:41:58,505 --> 02:42:00,547
manager, Teresa Dupont.

1885
02:42:00,787 --> 02:42:02,768
I also work here at City Hall, just for the record.

1886
02:42:03,248 --> 02:42:11,194
But yes, we actually decided at the CPC that we encourage any sort of funding that's left over to be split evenly back.

1887
02:42:11,234 --> 02:42:19,879
So if there's $100,000 left, which would be great, $50,000 would go back to free cash, $50,000 would go back to the CPA coffers.

1888
02:42:20,560 --> 02:42:22,061
So don't dig up any more problems.

1889
02:42:23,482 --> 02:42:27,865
All right, any further questions from members of the Council?

1890
02:42:30,761 --> 02:42:33,484
Seeing none, do we have any questions or comments from members of the public?

1891
02:42:37,708 --> 02:42:42,092
Seeing no hands in person or on Zoom, is there a motion?

1892
02:42:42,112 --> 02:42:46,417
On the motion to approve by Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Lozaro.

1893
02:42:46,837 --> 02:42:50,140
It was a dead tie and I was looking at Councilor Lozaro, which felt unfair.

1894
02:42:52,322 --> 02:42:54,585
So motion to approve the free cash appropriation

1895
02:42:55,357 --> 02:42:58,719
by Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Lazaro.

1896
02:42:58,739 --> 02:42:59,120
$65,000, yes?

1897
02:42:59,300 --> 02:42:59,580
Yes.

1898
02:43:00,901 --> 02:43:01,461
Councilor Callahan?

1899
02:43:01,481 --> 02:43:01,541
Yes.

1900
02:43:03,082 --> 02:43:03,943
Vice President Collins?

1901
02:43:06,325 --> 02:43:06,565
Yes.

1902
02:43:08,526 --> 02:43:09,247
Councilor Lazaro?

1903
02:43:09,267 --> 02:43:09,367
Yes.

1904
02:43:10,468 --> 02:43:11,408
Councilor Lemming is absent.

1905
02:43:11,588 --> 02:43:12,169
Councilor Scarpelli?

1906
02:43:12,189 --> 02:43:12,269
Yes.

1907
02:43:13,410 --> 02:43:13,850
Councilor Singh?

1908
02:43:13,870 --> 02:43:13,970
Yes.

1909
02:43:14,931 --> 02:43:15,511
President Behrs?

1910
02:43:15,751 --> 02:43:16,712
Yes.

1911
02:43:16,732 --> 02:43:18,333
16-101 absent, the motion passes.

1912
02:43:19,274 --> 02:43:22,176
And if you want to stick around for the next, you know,

1913
02:43:23,904 --> 02:43:25,105
we'll happily entertain you.

1914
02:43:25,125 --> 02:43:39,297
But so there was only one little thing in addition to the, there was a- In addition to the car park phase two and procedurally for the future, whenever we have two separate appropriations, would you like to see those as separate motions?

1915
02:43:39,957 --> 02:43:40,217
Okay.

1916
02:43:40,397 --> 02:43:42,079
Not when we're calling the roll, I'll tell you that.

1917
02:43:44,321 --> 02:43:45,682
So we are here tonight.

1918
02:43:46,102 --> 02:43:57,892
In addition to the $65,000 appropriation request for Car Park, we're also here asking for appropriation the amount of $5,500 to go to the Medford Community Gardens.

1919
02:43:58,533 --> 02:44:00,955
This is actually going to be for a project, which is kind of new.

1920
02:44:00,975 --> 02:44:02,075
We're very excited to see it.

1921
02:44:02,316 --> 02:44:05,458
A pop-up community garden here in Medford Square.

1922
02:44:06,399 --> 02:44:15,244
And I want to address that the garden itself, and actually, thank you, Teresa, I'm reminding myself that I have slides that I can share just to give some visuals.

1923
02:44:15,304 --> 02:44:16,885
I'll be quick here.

1924
02:44:18,525 --> 02:44:25,369
But it would actually be placed on one of the parcels that was being discussed earlier for redevelopment.

1925
02:44:25,409 --> 02:44:30,592
So the nature of this project is temporary.

1926
02:44:32,192 --> 02:44:33,033
Apologies here.

1927
02:44:34,852 --> 02:44:43,323
share screen, sharing screen.

1928
02:44:43,343 --> 02:44:45,465
1000 windows open here, so let me just minimize real quick.

1929
02:44:45,585 --> 02:44:45,946
Thank you.

1930
02:44:47,434 --> 02:44:51,055
So the garden here would actually be placed on an empty parcel.

1931
02:44:51,075 --> 02:44:55,417
I'm just going to skip ahead in my slides here to show exactly the location here.

1932
02:44:57,078 --> 02:45:03,260
It's the site of the former farmers market for folks who've been here for more than 14 years or so.

1933
02:45:03,280 --> 02:45:08,603
I myself haven't been, but so it's located adjacent from the senior center.

1934
02:45:09,683 --> 02:45:14,765
And as you can see here in the pictures, if you're facing it, it's City Hall's there in the back.

1935
02:45:15,405 --> 02:45:18,547
So I'll back up here and just kind of give a quick overview of this.

1936
02:45:20,547 --> 02:45:33,493
Again, temporary in nature, because we want to test out the need for this particular area of the of the community, as well as to in the future, take it and test it out amongst other areas of neighborhoods here.

1937
02:45:34,233 --> 02:45:35,734
It would be a total of 28 beds.

1938
02:45:37,094 --> 02:45:45,496
Water sourcing, they're going to get creative with some rain barrels, as well as exploring some options from the DPW to provide a permanent water source there.

1939
02:45:48,357 --> 02:45:58,360
Happy to go into more detail here, but we feel like this is a really prominent, highly visible location in the city to help promote and do some outreach for community gardens.

1940
02:45:58,820 --> 02:46:02,402
So it's an educational, it's a vibrancy coming to the R Square here.

1941
02:46:04,597 --> 02:46:07,739
for short money, and we would ask for your support in this project.

1942
02:46:09,120 --> 02:46:10,741
Also, the site of the former carnival.

1943
02:46:11,442 --> 02:46:12,683
Oh, how long ago was that?

1944
02:46:13,083 --> 02:46:14,544
Too long.

1945
02:46:15,024 --> 02:46:18,207
Councillor Callaghan, and then we have a motion from Councillor Scarpelli to approve.

1946
02:46:18,267 --> 02:46:18,787
Councillor Callaghan.

1947
02:46:19,719 --> 02:46:20,019
Thank you.

1948
02:46:20,159 --> 02:46:29,751
So this $5,500, is this adding to a fund to make this happen, or is that the whole amount to make this happen?

1949
02:46:29,831 --> 02:46:31,192
That's a great question.

1950
02:46:31,773 --> 02:46:34,576
It is not the full funding amount for this project.

1951
02:46:34,596 --> 02:46:37,240
The Garden Commission will be doing some fundraising.

1952
02:46:37,780 --> 02:46:45,585
The committee, the Community Preservation Committee elected to fund the reusable portions of this project.

1953
02:46:46,005 --> 02:46:52,068
There are costs associated with renting some fencing, some temporary fencing to secure the garden as well as loom and soil.

1954
02:46:52,989 --> 02:46:58,732
The committee felt that that would not be an appropriate use of CPA funds to pay for those temporary nature things.

1955
02:46:58,772 --> 02:47:04,055
So we are funding the infrastructure, if you will, and the gardens will be fundraising for the remaining.

1956
02:47:05,432 --> 02:47:07,593
garden, soil, fencing.

1957
02:47:08,353 --> 02:47:09,594
That's it.

1958
02:47:09,614 --> 02:47:11,255
That's it.

1959
02:47:11,476 --> 02:47:14,578
I will say it does strike me that this project is like

1960
02:47:15,651 --> 02:47:20,153
$5,000 and replacing the HVAC system in the school is $25 million.

1961
02:47:21,214 --> 02:47:23,315
I mean, I understand that these things are real, but like, wow.

1962
02:47:25,376 --> 02:47:28,417
I haven't been long in the municipal arena and I feel that way every day.

1963
02:47:28,437 --> 02:47:36,761
Yes, we're happy that we can stretch our CPA dollars to fulfill this project.

1964
02:47:37,521 --> 02:47:44,985
And just to note, these were both unanimous votes of the CPC to recommend and the conditions you mentioned about the community garden were mentioned here.

1965
02:47:48,181 --> 02:47:48,942
I am excited about it.

1966
02:47:48,982 --> 02:47:50,243
Thank you.

1967
02:47:50,363 --> 02:47:53,626
I just have one question actually for Amanda, which is kind of why I asked you to say I'm so sorry.

1968
02:47:53,646 --> 02:47:59,392
And it's, you don't need to answer for too long.

1969
02:47:59,612 --> 02:48:05,138
Do you think that the fact that those courts were buried is the reason that, like the courts above ended up becoming like

1970
02:48:06,280 --> 02:48:07,401
cracked and broken and stuff?

1971
02:48:08,502 --> 02:48:09,823
It's possible.

1972
02:48:11,124 --> 02:48:18,389
I am not an engineer but when you have different, well the soil in that area is terrible.

1973
02:48:19,430 --> 02:48:31,419
There's a lot of like organic material which means that it settles at different rates and then add to that the fact that you have these like concrete and base course bits kind of in the mix.

1974
02:48:33,140 --> 02:48:39,685
you're having different parts of what's up top settle at different rates.

1975
02:48:39,886 --> 02:48:41,647
And that causes cracking over time.

1976
02:48:41,987 --> 02:48:44,910
And that's something you're accounting for in this project.

1977
02:48:45,010 --> 02:48:45,310
Yes.

1978
02:48:45,370 --> 02:48:45,610
Yes.

1979
02:48:45,690 --> 02:49:00,803
So one of the cool, it was cool to watch one of the things that we were doing specifically under the basketball court with the shade structure, because that's a heavy structure, is these special ground improvements where you dig into the ground very deeply

1980
02:49:01,323 --> 02:49:07,207
And you create these empty columns, and then you fill the columns with gravel and shake it, and it compacts the gravel.

1981
02:49:07,327 --> 02:49:13,710
And so you're creating these strong pillars within the ground to keep it from moving around so much.

1982
02:49:14,691 --> 02:49:24,417
So that's one of the things that we're doing, and regrading the site a bit, using new, fresh materials for some of the heavier portions of the site.

1983
02:49:25,197 --> 02:49:26,877
Great, thank you, appreciate that.

1984
02:49:27,617 --> 02:49:32,618
On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to approve the CPC appropriation request, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1985
02:49:33,258 --> 02:49:34,219
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1986
02:49:39,119 --> 02:49:39,759
Councilor Callahan.

1987
02:49:40,860 --> 02:49:41,740
Vice-President Collins.

1988
02:49:42,300 --> 02:49:42,500
Yes.

1989
02:49:43,760 --> 02:49:44,720
Councilor Lozano.

1990
02:49:46,041 --> 02:49:47,021
Councilor Lemons is absent.

1991
02:49:47,241 --> 02:49:48,021
Councilor Scarpelli.

1992
02:49:49,341 --> 02:49:50,681
Six in the affirmative, one absent.

1993
02:49:50,701 --> 02:49:51,301
We're not done yet.

1994
02:49:51,641 --> 02:49:51,761
Oh.

1995
02:49:51,862 --> 02:49:52,422
We got two more.

1996
02:49:52,662 --> 02:49:53,282
Oh, sorry.

1997
02:49:53,302 --> 02:49:53,842
Councilor Singh.

1998
02:49:55,200 --> 02:49:55,840
President Paris.

1999
02:49:56,961 --> 02:50:01,204
Yes.

2000
02:50:02,225 --> 02:50:05,367
Six of the affirmative, one absent, the motion passes.

2001
02:50:07,208 --> 02:50:08,509
Thank you very much for your support.

2002
02:50:08,569 --> 02:50:10,130
Saw which way that one was going.

2003
02:50:14,494 --> 02:50:15,314
Thanks you guys.

2004
02:50:19,057 --> 02:50:19,297
Great.

2005
02:50:22,027 --> 02:50:27,430
It's like a first term trigger of some kind, I think you were the last in the alphabet at the time.

2006
02:50:40,817 --> 02:50:41,717
Peter Cushing with us.

2007
02:50:41,777 --> 02:50:42,798
He's been with us all night.

2008
02:50:42,838 --> 02:50:45,478
Thank you, Peter, for sticking with us.

2009
02:50:46,079 --> 02:50:51,440
And this is on the agenda because we approved the funding for this a free cash appropriation.

2010
02:50:51,460 --> 02:51:00,402
And it turns out there's a state law that requires us to also for specifically for lease to own agreements, we have to pass a separate thing.

2011
02:51:00,562 --> 02:51:02,443
So I'll go to Peter to explain that a little more.

2012
02:51:03,497 --> 02:51:07,719
Yeah, so the governing body when it comes to overall finances.

2013
02:51:08,659 --> 02:51:13,862
My understanding is always that the governing body of the public schools is the school board, which is true.

2014
02:51:14,862 --> 02:51:20,105
But when it comes to a five year lease option which will bridge numerous fiscal years five.

2015
02:51:21,626 --> 02:51:26,910
We need the approval of this August body to approve that.

2016
02:51:27,871 --> 02:51:29,052
I'll give you a quick background.

2017
02:51:29,272 --> 02:51:30,072
I know I mentioned it.

2018
02:51:30,493 --> 02:51:36,217
I think it was last week that I was here, but tonight I've traveled from softball to home back to the Bridgetown meeting.

2019
02:51:37,458 --> 02:51:39,780
So I'm very civically engaged this evening.

2020
02:51:40,500 --> 02:51:47,626
The, the point of the matter is, is that we started out with this on state contract, which gives us a 20% discount.

2021
02:51:48,667 --> 02:51:58,014
We've negotiated or I've negotiated, but she wasn't negotiating up to a 28% discount with significant other add ons, including.

2022
02:51:58,994 --> 02:52:12,000
I believe 32 vape sensors that are being given to the district for the term of this, as well as, and then will be ours on outright once the end of, so there'll be no payments on those vape sensors.

2023
02:52:12,580 --> 02:52:18,983
I might be off on the number just a little bit, but it is a high number that we have a hard negotiation.

2024
02:52:19,483 --> 02:52:37,562
This is a comprehensive security upgrade that will address cameras in all areas of our schools, electronic access at our doors, security vestibules, and other things that really are not the purview of a public discussion but would be executive.

2025
02:52:38,443 --> 02:52:39,344
committee type work.

2026
02:52:39,464 --> 02:52:56,861
But I want to know that this is a significant investment of time, effort, and negotiating skill to bring in a project several hundred thousand dollars less than we were at a few years ago when we looked at this, and added significant value.

2027
02:52:57,121 --> 02:52:58,463
That being, in particular,

2028
02:52:59,043 --> 02:53:08,510
the security vestibules, vape sensors, and just another comprehensive security tool that is going to really be an asset to the district moving forward.

2029
02:53:09,371 --> 02:53:12,434
I really would appreciate the vote of this body.

2030
02:53:12,834 --> 02:53:20,940
We've worked extraordinarily hard since last Friday when we got legal opinions on contracts to land those with Motorola where they need to be.

2031
02:53:21,420 --> 02:53:28,586
The hope is that they will be able to be entered into DocuSign through the procurement office tomorrow and be able to move forward.

2032
02:53:30,630 --> 02:53:52,081
Great, thank you, Peter and just to note the specific language, dear President bears and city counselors I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body vote to authorize at least purchase financing agreement after chat under chapter 44 of section 21 see of the general laws for the acquisition of security equipment upgrades remember public school buildings for which an appropriation was approved approved by a vote of the city council on April 29 2025 council paper number 25 066.

2033
02:53:55,328 --> 02:54:02,513
The term of such agreement not to exceed five years and further that the school committee shall be authorized to enter into such agreement and any related documents on behalf of the city.

2034
02:54:03,173 --> 02:54:06,795
Thank you for your kind attention to these matters, respectfully submitted, Brianna Legault-Kern, Mayor.

2035
02:54:07,075 --> 02:54:09,477
So that is the item before us.

2036
02:54:09,717 --> 02:54:11,238
Do we have any comments or questions?

2037
02:54:13,059 --> 02:54:15,481
On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to approve, seconded by?

2038
02:54:15,821 --> 02:54:17,142
Seconded by Councilor Lazaro.

2039
02:54:19,363 --> 02:54:20,284
Any public discussion?

2040
02:54:25,756 --> 02:54:26,056
On this.

2041
02:54:27,277 --> 02:54:28,917
Okay.

2042
02:54:29,458 --> 02:54:35,080
I assume you had a study depending on 4421 C. Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2043
02:54:37,121 --> 02:54:37,801
Councilor Callahan.

2044
02:54:39,442 --> 02:54:40,342
Vice President of Collins.

2045
02:54:40,782 --> 02:54:41,022
Yes.

2046
02:54:42,263 --> 02:54:43,223
Councilor Lazaro.

2047
02:54:44,564 --> 02:54:45,544
Councilor Lemming is absent.

2048
02:54:46,224 --> 02:54:46,945
Councilor Scarpelli.

2049
02:54:47,925 --> 02:54:48,425
Councilor Seng.

2050
02:54:48,445 --> 02:54:48,505
Yes.

2051
02:54:49,366 --> 02:54:49,966
President Bears.

2052
02:54:50,186 --> 02:54:50,386
Yes.

2053
02:54:50,686 --> 02:54:52,287
60 affirmative one absent the motion passes.

2054
02:54:53,196 --> 02:55:00,358
Public participation, to participate outside of Zoom, please email ahernabase at medford-ma.gov.

2055
02:55:01,039 --> 02:55:02,779
We did have a paper from Anne Driscoll.

2056
02:55:02,819 --> 02:55:05,940
Do we have Anne on the meeting?

2057
02:55:05,960 --> 02:55:13,363
Anne, I don't think you're here in person.

2058
02:55:13,683 --> 02:55:14,883
Anne, are you on Zoom?

2059
02:55:18,024 --> 02:55:19,745
Is there a motion to

2060
02:55:22,477 --> 02:55:26,118
Yeah, what do you think can we, we can just carry it over we're just going to carry it over.

2061
02:55:27,858 --> 02:55:36,161
So we can just go to open public participation, name and address for the record, you'll have three minutes you can come to the podium or raise your hand on zoom.

2062
02:55:37,661 --> 02:55:39,362
Sure, so, Michael Hesselman 499 Main Street.

2063
02:55:44,685 --> 02:55:56,373
feel compelled to come and make in person, many of the comments that I have emailed you all as a group collectively about over the last few weeks.

2064
02:55:57,645 --> 02:56:03,689
And it's unfortunate because otherwise this has been a really pleasant City Council session with really fun, cool stuff.

2065
02:56:04,830 --> 02:56:15,096
Nevertheless, we live in increasingly dangerous times with increasing federal overreach and lawlessness coming from our federal government.

2066
02:56:16,517 --> 02:56:25,983
Every day, it feels like there is a new example of extreme federal overreach in Italy and

2067
02:56:26,524 --> 02:56:31,626
blatantly illegal behavior that is continuing to go unchecked.

2068
02:56:32,906 --> 02:56:40,909
It's being and it's increasingly becoming normalized, which is in and of itself horrific.

2069
02:56:41,749 --> 02:56:53,353
We have secret police effectively that are roaming around picking up people without due process, without providing warrants, without providing any sort of judicial order.

2070
02:56:54,193 --> 02:56:54,313
And

2071
02:56:55,115 --> 02:57:05,377
Before I get flack about this, yes, there are certain situations where federal agents can make arrests without providing a warrant or lawful judicial order.

2072
02:57:05,817 --> 02:57:06,918
They're incredibly narrow.

2073
02:57:07,398 --> 02:57:18,140
And the very fact that they are pre-planning and premeditating these arrests means that they do not fall within those very narrow bounds of when they can

2074
02:57:18,780 --> 02:57:20,321
do warrantless arrests.

2075
02:57:21,042 --> 02:57:28,546
So by virtue of that alone, these people are acting in an completely illegal rogue state.

2076
02:57:29,347 --> 02:57:30,687
They're effectively criminals.

2077
02:57:31,628 --> 02:57:37,031
I know that we're not going to get the police to commit to arresting criminals that have badges.

2078
02:57:38,372 --> 02:57:39,993
That sucks.

2079
02:57:41,094 --> 02:57:41,434
However,

2080
02:57:42,917 --> 02:57:45,639
there needs to be continued pressure for them to do something.

2081
02:57:46,020 --> 02:57:59,651
There needs to be continued pressure for the mayor to do something and make some substantive statement and formulate and articulate an actual substantive action and policy beyond we're not gonna cooperate with them.

2082
02:58:00,451 --> 02:58:06,556
Other cities, sorry, I don't wanna make anyone's transcription job more of a pain.

2083
02:58:09,198 --> 02:58:27,021
with similar, if not identical, non-cooperation policies, have nevertheless had their law enforcement cooperate, enable, facilitate, and even completely misinform the public about what federal agents can and cannot do.

2084
02:58:28,402 --> 02:58:34,803
We need to have our police and our executive administration here in the city actually

2085
02:58:36,392 --> 02:58:44,357
counter this narrative and say something affirmatively to reassure us as residents that we're not going to stand for this here in Medford.

2086
02:58:45,318 --> 02:58:46,939
I would like to see more being done.

2087
02:58:47,239 --> 02:58:55,504
The HRC reestablishment was a wonderful surprise to me because I had not expected that.

2088
02:58:55,544 --> 02:59:01,307
And it's at least some, again, I mean, it's meager steps forward, but it's better than just treading water.

2089
02:59:01,327 --> 02:59:01,347
I

2090
02:59:04,555 --> 02:59:19,944
would like to see more communication on a more regular basis from our chief of police that is specifically about what's going on in regards to ICE and federal incursions into our local space.

2091
02:59:21,225 --> 02:59:30,931
And frankly, I think that every step, every stage of our government should be willing, our municipal government should be willing to

2092
02:59:32,959 --> 02:59:39,803
tiptoe into great legal gray areas right now, because the other side is ignoring the law.

2093
02:59:40,944 --> 02:59:47,207
The other side is literally talking about a suspending hobbyist corpus, which is crazy.

2094
02:59:47,227 --> 02:59:49,989
Yeah, and literally can't be done.

2095
02:59:50,849 --> 02:59:51,950
Not that they need to anyway.

2096
02:59:52,390 --> 02:59:58,614
So you know, if there are certain actions that we decide to take as a community that are

2097
03:00:00,168 --> 03:00:05,771
not illegal, but not legally are in a legally ambiguous space.

2098
03:00:06,252 --> 03:00:07,892
That's not the end of the world.

2099
03:00:08,273 --> 03:00:15,157
If it is to protect our neighbors and protect our residents, and we should be willing to take that risk and do what needs to be done to keep our residents safe.

2100
03:00:15,937 --> 03:00:16,858
We're a little bit over.

2101
03:00:17,038 --> 03:00:17,478
Thank you.

2102
03:00:17,758 --> 03:00:18,378
Appreciate it.

2103
03:00:18,398 --> 03:00:20,099
Appreciate the comment.

2104
03:00:20,159 --> 03:00:20,740
I can just say

2105
03:00:21,967 --> 03:00:36,558
As one counselor, I have been communicating a similar message to the mayor and the chief of police, especially last week when we had federal masks, unidentified federal agents in the city, intimidating the public.

2106
03:00:37,018 --> 03:00:49,928
And when we have this abuse of power and intimidation and essentially a form of extortion as well to extort our compliance with illegality, I don't think our response can be

2107
03:00:51,270 --> 03:00:52,371
We can't do anything about it.

2108
03:00:52,812 --> 03:01:02,723
I personally received communications from people asking me, are, are these, who are these people, is there a criminal gang in my neighborhood.

2109
03:01:04,719 --> 03:01:07,420
you know, and it's people are very, people are very scared.

2110
03:01:07,740 --> 03:01:25,363
So I think and what we saw in Worcester last week, and how Worcester police handled that abhorrently, and is now pushing what I consider to be a pretty reactionary administration in the city of Worcester to consider a city policy about what the city will do in response to this.

2111
03:01:25,923 --> 03:01:30,784
I think for folks who have said that they are

2112
03:01:32,018 --> 03:01:43,300
on board with this, I think we need to be doing the same and have a very clear policy about this, how the city responds to federal intimidation and abuse of power, as well as informing the public about it.

2113
03:01:43,480 --> 03:01:49,042
And I know that public health and community safety brought up some of these concerns last week.

2114
03:01:49,062 --> 03:01:50,362
I don't know if you guys want to add anything.

2115
03:01:50,382 --> 03:01:51,542
I see Councilor Zaro.

2116
03:01:53,522 --> 03:01:54,583
Thank you.

2117
03:01:54,603 --> 03:01:57,523
I appreciate this conversation.

2118
03:01:57,543 --> 03:02:01,084
And I think there is more discussion to have

2119
03:02:02,327 --> 03:02:25,625
there are limitations to what our public safety officers will be able to do is my understanding, but I also know that we as local elected officials and local leaders have an obligation to

2120
03:02:27,197 --> 03:02:29,838
do what we can to try to keep our residents safe.

2121
03:02:30,119 --> 03:02:33,460
So that's been at the forefront of my mind for a long time.

2122
03:02:34,621 --> 03:02:38,523
And that means like physical safety and psychological safety.

2123
03:02:39,183 --> 03:02:49,188
So I continue to grapple with that, with how best to try to achieve that for our residents.

2124
03:02:49,628 --> 03:02:56,392
And I think that there's,

2125
03:02:57,525 --> 03:03:18,100
definitely more to be done within our local government and in our communities in mutual aid ways that do not participate in the hierarchy of law enforcement because there are limitations to that.

2126
03:03:19,621 --> 03:03:27,287
So I am thinking about how we keep each other safe all the time and all the ways that we do that.

2127
03:03:28,454 --> 03:03:29,855
but thank you for bringing this up.

2128
03:03:31,316 --> 03:03:31,836
Thank you.

2129
03:03:31,856 --> 03:03:48,788
And, you know, I'm gonna watch the recording, see what was said, but what really frustrated me about what happened in Worcester, what I don't wanna see happen here is local police functionally being used to facilitate and protect people executing legally dubious or illegal orders.

2130
03:03:48,828 --> 03:03:54,052
I think that's a serious, I think that's maybe a gap in the non-cooperation agreement that we have right now.

2131
03:03:54,572 --> 03:03:55,473
Vice President Collins.

2132
03:03:59,052 --> 03:03:59,992
Thank you, President Beres.

2133
03:04:00,032 --> 03:04:02,973
And yeah, it's a difficult topic to bring up.

2134
03:04:03,013 --> 03:04:06,093
I thank the president for bringing it up, continuing to bring it up.

2135
03:04:07,994 --> 03:04:18,095
Speaking for only myself as one counselor, this is something that is obviously, I'm sure I'm not speaking only for myself when I say this is something that is extremely preoccupying to many of us right now.

2136
03:04:18,355 --> 03:04:25,757
And we're in uncharted territory relating to how a local government can and should respond

2137
03:04:27,175 --> 03:04:34,977
to this, but what I think is unacceptable would be to say because this is uncharted, we have no agency to chart our own path here.

2138
03:04:36,017 --> 03:04:38,318
That would at least be unacceptable to me.

2139
03:04:38,338 --> 03:04:53,121
I think that the work ahead of us right now collaboratively throughout the entire government of the city of Medford is to craft a policy collaboratively so that we can all be sure that we are doing what we can to make sure that public safety in Medford

2140
03:04:53,981 --> 03:04:57,142
is in every way directed towards public safety in Medford.

2141
03:04:57,423 --> 03:05:01,504
And some of our very most initial conversations about this, obviously, it's a fraught topic.

2142
03:05:01,564 --> 03:05:03,805
I really think that everybody's intentions about this are good.

2143
03:05:05,366 --> 03:05:13,489
But I think that we have to keep in mind that a response can look like a lot of things and be more helpful than what it is right now.

2144
03:05:14,329 --> 03:05:22,153
I think that there is a very... I think that, you know, it's kind of trite,

2145
03:05:23,878 --> 03:05:28,759
Inaction is action, and I think that's what we have to be wary of when it comes to what we are declining to do.

2146
03:05:29,419 --> 03:05:35,101
When it comes to our response to ICE and other federal agencies in Medford, we can't just do nothing.

2147
03:05:35,121 --> 03:05:36,301
That's obviously insufficient.

2148
03:05:36,361 --> 03:05:37,801
I think the resident said that very well.

2149
03:05:39,001 --> 03:05:45,163
Right now, we have a lot of ordinary residents in the community that are taking on the work of

2150
03:05:47,587 --> 03:06:06,639
figuring out what public safety looks like in this time when federal agents are coming into our community, barely letting even our chief of police know, certainly not letting other city leaders such as ourselves know, being in public property, being on residential streets, masked, unidentified, there's residents taking on the onus of saying, hey,

2151
03:06:09,380 --> 03:06:09,941
Who are you?

2152
03:06:10,161 --> 03:06:10,902
What are you doing here?

2153
03:06:10,922 --> 03:06:12,844
Is this okay?

2154
03:06:12,864 --> 03:06:13,705
This seems suspicious.

2155
03:06:13,745 --> 03:06:15,747
Let's make sure the people in the neighborhood are okay.

2156
03:06:16,247 --> 03:06:21,653
Because our local government has not taken on the onus of doing that community safety work.

2157
03:06:21,713 --> 03:06:22,674
And I think that needs to change.

2158
03:06:22,714 --> 03:06:26,258
I think we need to share that responsibility with the community, obviously.

2159
03:06:26,358 --> 03:06:30,682
And we share the responsibility of, if ICE has been present in the community,

2160
03:06:31,683 --> 03:06:36,026
using our official channels and our official power to say, what comes next now?

2161
03:06:36,066 --> 03:06:36,967
What do people need now?

2162
03:06:37,027 --> 03:06:37,607
Are people good?

2163
03:06:37,647 --> 03:06:38,247
What do they need?

2164
03:06:38,267 --> 03:06:39,048
Do they know their rights?

2165
03:06:40,609 --> 03:06:45,812
Is there support that's needed in the wake of being visited by ICE?

2166
03:06:45,852 --> 03:06:47,073
And it goes further than that as well.

2167
03:06:47,153 --> 03:06:49,295
But what I think is really unacceptable is to say,

2168
03:06:50,916 --> 03:06:55,240
Our responsibility is to do nothing and pretend that that's enough because it obviously isn't.

2169
03:06:55,320 --> 03:06:59,264
So I thank community members for leading the way here.

2170
03:06:59,484 --> 03:07:08,493
And I feel resolute that, frankly, city leadership needs to follow in the footsteps of residents who are already doing the work of figuring out what community safety looks like in this time.

2171
03:07:09,955 --> 03:07:11,636
So the conversation has to continue.

2172
03:07:11,776 --> 03:07:12,037
Thank you.

2173
03:07:13,878 --> 03:07:14,219
Thank you.

2174
03:07:17,822 --> 03:07:22,044
All right, we do have one item under unfinished business eligible for third reading.

2175
03:07:40,834 --> 03:07:42,335
Oh, sorry, go ahead.

2176
03:07:44,557 --> 03:07:49,799
Motion to take item 25-053 from the table.

2177
03:07:50,780 --> 03:07:52,761

Yes, takes the affirmative, what absent the motion passes and the ordinance is ordained.

2195
03:08:59,616 --> 03:09:01,176
Any further discussion or is there a motion?

2196
03:09:02,877 --> 03:09:03,578
