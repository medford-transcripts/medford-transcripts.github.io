1
00:00:00,249 --> 00:00:01,491
It's putting the city at risk.

2
00:00:02,753 --> 00:00:05,438
It's causing $100,000 in overtime.

3
00:00:05,818 --> 00:00:08,042
This is a joke, and this is disgusting.

4
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:17,324
A heated back and forth during a packed city council meeting in Medford about the search for a new fire chief.

5
00:00:17,864 --> 00:00:24,189
And it comes after serious allegations of sick time abuse at the city's fire department, which is now under investigation.

6
00:00:24,209 --> 00:00:29,793
City officials say they spent nearly six figures in just one weekend trying to cover those empty shifts.

7
00:00:30,274 --> 00:00:35,297
Our Kirsten Glavin is live in Medford City Hall, where that meeting just ended a short time ago.

8
00:00:35,518 --> 00:00:35,858
Kirsten.

9
00:00:38,444 --> 00:00:38,844
Yeah, that's right.

10
00:00:38,864 --> 00:00:40,765
There's two issues at hand here.

11
00:00:40,825 --> 00:00:43,125
The first is the sick time and the overtime.

12
00:00:43,185 --> 00:00:47,766
The mayor says that this is becoming a financial and a safety concern.

13
00:00:47,786 --> 00:00:51,527
Now, the second issue at hand is who will be the next fire chief.

14
00:00:51,807 --> 00:01:00,249
And that was a heated topic here at this city council meeting where the committee or the council rather ultimately voted to turn this over to committee.

15
00:01:01,877 --> 00:01:07,481
An investigation now underway into the sick calls and overtime accrued by the Medford Fire Department.

16
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:11,463
After one weekend this month, nearly all firefighters called out.

17
00:01:11,664 --> 00:01:13,225
I believe it was an orchestrated event.

18
00:01:13,565 --> 00:01:22,711
According to the city's mayor, during the first weekend of February, 21 out of 23 firefighters called out sick for their day shifts just on that Saturday alone.

19
00:01:23,151 --> 00:01:28,815
She says many of them got paid for that sick time, then came in for the night shifts and collected overtime.

20
00:01:32,657 --> 00:01:34,198
We are way outside of our budget.

21
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:40,519
We have almost $100,000 for just that weekend alone, and we have needs in this community that need to be met.

22
00:01:40,779 --> 00:01:46,000
The firefighters' union is denying those claims, calling them rumors and now threatening legal action.

23
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,301
It's not my business why they use their sick day.

24
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:58,423
President of Local 1032 Medford Fire neither condoning nor explaining why the firefighters called out, only claiming the mayor has a history of attacking unions.

25
00:01:58,903 --> 00:01:59,623
I can't explain.

26
00:01:59,643 --> 00:02:01,905
They use their contractual right to use a sick day.

27
00:02:03,105 --> 00:02:05,046
21 out of 23 people for the day shift?

28
00:02:05,406 --> 00:02:05,647
Yes.

29
00:02:06,367 --> 00:02:07,007
Were they all sick?

30
00:02:07,868 --> 00:02:08,888
I'm not a doctor.

31
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:09,729
I can't answer that.

32
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:10,229
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:11,846 --> 00:02:21,289
Meanwhile, at a heated city council meeting Tuesday night, the mayor asking to fill the department's open chief position with someone of her own choosing to manage oversight.

34
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:25,570
Firefighters wanting one of their own at the top as the current chief retires.

35
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:28,831
So you think they're kind of picking and choosing who they want to lead their department.

36
00:02:28,891 --> 00:02:29,632
Is that fair to say?

37
00:02:29,652 --> 00:02:30,272
That's fair.

38
00:02:30,712 --> 00:02:42,135
The union sending out this email titled request to stand down, asking members from outside departments not to apply for the chief job, saying there are qualified candidates at the department already.

39
00:02:42,655 --> 00:02:43,495
They don't know method.

40
00:02:43,515 --> 00:02:44,315
They're not from method.

41
00:02:44,355 --> 00:02:45,396
They didn't grow up in method.

42
00:02:45,436 --> 00:02:47,276
They didn't serve the citizens of method.

43
00:02:47,656 --> 00:02:50,237
They don't have the knowledge that our members have.

44
00:02:53,917 --> 00:02:57,741
Again, the council did just vote to table this to committee.

45
00:02:57,821 --> 00:03:05,970
And I did just speak with the union president, and he says he is currently disgusted with the city and the council over what happened in there.

46
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:11,595
And at this point, Medford, it looks like, will be without a fire chief by the end of this week.

47
00:03:11,976 --> 00:03:13,217
We're live here in Medford tonight.

48
00:03:13,237 --> 00:03:15,039
I'm Kirsten Glavin, NBC10 Boston.
