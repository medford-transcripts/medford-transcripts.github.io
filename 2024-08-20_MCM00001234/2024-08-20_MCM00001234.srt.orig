1
00:00:00,251 --> 00:00:01,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Good afternoon, everyone.

2
00:00:03,332 --> 00:00:08,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Bob and Ben, I just want to thank you for helping me out last month while I was in sunny Florida.

3
00:00:08,072 --> 00:00:10,173
[SPEAKER_06]: So I couldn't make the meeting.

4
00:00:10,213 --> 00:00:11,553
[SPEAKER_06]: I just couldn't do it.

5
00:00:11,913 --> 00:00:13,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Even by Zoom, I couldn't do it.

6
00:00:13,353 --> 00:00:19,854
[SPEAKER_06]: So if everyone else will just indulge us, we need to do a little housekeeping first.

7
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:27,496
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to review the minutes of last month's meeting and just kind of give them the once over.

8
00:00:29,456 --> 00:00:31,197
[SPEAKER_06]: I need a motion to approve them.

9
00:00:31,277 --> 00:00:33,699
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have looked at them.

10
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:39,042
[SPEAKER_06]: There was only one item on it that I had a question on, and it's probably because.

11
00:00:41,502 --> 00:00:46,943
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't here to hear the nuances of it, but I noticed that it's on the agenda again.

12
00:00:47,023 --> 00:00:58,945
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about hearings information being submitted to Daria on the Friday before, so she's not under the gun putting things in the last minute.

13
00:00:58,965 --> 00:01:06,107
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess we can talk about that after we handle our two items on the agenda.

14
00:01:08,447 --> 00:01:15,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby, Ben, one of you, since I wasn't here, one of you want to make a motion to approve the minutes and we can get that off the table?

15
00:01:18,074 --> 00:01:18,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

16
00:01:18,354 --> 00:01:19,275
[SPEAKER_07]: Bob, do you want to?

17
00:01:19,715 --> 00:01:20,156
[SPEAKER_07]: I've read it.

18
00:01:20,176 --> 00:01:20,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

19
00:01:21,377 --> 00:01:27,061
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll make a motion to approve the minutes of the 20th License Commission meeting.

20
00:01:27,701 --> 00:01:28,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything looks fine.

21
00:01:29,462 --> 00:01:30,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Make the motion to approve.

22
00:01:31,023 --> 00:01:31,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

23
00:01:31,464 --> 00:01:32,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Bobby.

24
00:01:33,948 --> 00:01:34,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I read it.

25
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:35,189
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll second it.

26
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:36,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Ben, you want to second it?

27
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:36,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

28
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,330
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, Daria, thanks.

29
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,271
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually kind of a tedious one.

30
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:43,973
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of information there, all those dates.

31
00:01:44,393 --> 00:01:46,074
[SPEAKER_07]: And thanks for doing that.

32
00:01:46,254 --> 00:01:46,874
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks good.

33
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:47,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Very accurate.

34
00:01:48,315 --> 00:01:49,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

35
00:01:49,716 --> 00:01:50,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Daria, thank you very much.

36
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:51,197
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

37
00:01:51,997 --> 00:01:53,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for the second.

38
00:01:53,157 --> 00:01:56,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Ben, all in favor of approving the minutes, say aye.

39
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

40
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Done.

41
00:01:59,561 --> 00:02:00,961
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll take that off the table.

42
00:02:03,147 --> 00:02:13,169
[SPEAKER_06]: As I was saying, what I wanted to do when I was looking at the agenda, let me see here, I'm sorry.

43
00:02:14,615 --> 00:02:15,735
[SPEAKER_06]: I got them on my other screen.

44
00:02:15,775 --> 00:02:18,276
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll, we've taken, we've knocked off the minutes.

45
00:02:18,656 --> 00:02:25,578
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the second item says to discuss and vote on the deadline proposal brought forth by, let's shove that to the end.

46
00:02:25,638 --> 00:02:32,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's take care of the two, you know, event them and 25 Salem Street LLC.

47
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's take care of that.

48
00:02:36,101 --> 00:02:37,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Brian, we're gonna start with you.

49
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:40,082
[SPEAKER_06]: You always seem to have all your ducks in a row.

50
00:02:40,122 --> 00:02:41,122
[SPEAKER_06]: I looked at the package.

51
00:02:42,122 --> 00:02:48,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, we're very familiar with you and your events, your establishment.

52
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,347
[SPEAKER_06]: You've been doing great since the day you opened.

53
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:53,428
[SPEAKER_06]: No incidents, no problems.

54
00:02:53,948 --> 00:02:54,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep up the good work.

55
00:02:54,969 --> 00:02:58,891
[SPEAKER_06]: But tell us about what this event's all about, please.

56
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:05,794
[SPEAKER_01]: So Myth, in 2023, we are hosting the Friends of Bedford Family Network here.

57
00:03:05,814 --> 00:03:08,636
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be, I think, the third time that they've been here.

58
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:10,016
[SPEAKER_01]: And essentially, it's

59
00:03:12,203 --> 00:03:23,408
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an opportunity for local families to get together and raising opportunities as well for that organization, which supports the family network here in the area.

60
00:03:23,528 --> 00:03:26,069
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we love having them.

61
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:27,910
[SPEAKER_01]: People play games.

62
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,431
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of hang out, do music.

63
00:03:30,451 --> 00:03:35,353
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of people involved, and also kids and family and adults.

64
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:39,955
[SPEAKER_01]: And the adults have a few benefits if it's available.

65
00:03:41,571 --> 00:03:44,212
[SPEAKER_01]: offer to apply for the application for it.

66
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:45,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

67
00:03:45,432 --> 00:03:45,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

68
00:03:45,852 --> 00:03:52,655
[SPEAKER_06]: I see beer and wine, your estimated number of guests of 50, three to seven.

69
00:03:52,995 --> 00:03:59,957
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if anything else, Bobby, Ben, anything in there that caught your eye?

70
00:04:00,817 --> 00:04:01,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Brian's always been good.

71
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:08,700
[SPEAKER_06]: He provides us with a diagram so we know where the beer and wine will be stored.

72
00:04:10,705 --> 00:04:12,607
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I don't have any questions.

73
00:04:16,051 --> 00:04:18,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything looked fine to me, Mr. Chairman.

74
00:04:19,794 --> 00:04:22,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Brian always does a great job.

75
00:04:22,597 --> 00:04:24,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice diagram and layout.

76
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,266
[SPEAKER_05]: We know he's got insurance on file and never any issues there, so I don't have a problem with it.

77
00:04:31,927 --> 00:04:33,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, no.

78
00:04:33,788 --> 00:04:35,429
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree.

79
00:04:35,549 --> 00:04:39,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it open to the public or is it a private event?

80
00:04:39,732 --> 00:04:44,815
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, but they do sell some tickets in advance.

81
00:04:46,796 --> 00:04:52,479
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to necessarily turn people away, but they want to give people the opportunity to be able to lock in a spot.

82
00:04:53,299 --> 00:04:54,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, cool, cool.

83
00:04:55,451 --> 00:04:55,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, good.

84
00:04:57,112 --> 00:04:59,174
[SPEAKER_07]: No, just curious about how that worked.

85
00:04:59,574 --> 00:05:01,816
[SPEAKER_07]: And no, everything looks good to me.

86
00:05:02,257 --> 00:05:06,120
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I would approve this.

87
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,041
[SPEAKER_07]: We're good with this.

88
00:05:07,261 --> 00:05:08,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

89
00:05:09,022 --> 00:05:12,765
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the two of you make a motion, and let's get this one off the table.

90
00:05:13,686 --> 00:05:16,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Mr. Commissioner, I'll do that.

91
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:18,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Chairman, I mean.

92
00:05:21,057 --> 00:05:24,518
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll make a motion to approve the application for a one-day license.

93
00:05:24,618 --> 00:05:25,979
[SPEAKER_07]: This is for Event Them.

94
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:31,561
[SPEAKER_07]: This is for an event on Sunday, May 5th from the hours of 3 p.m.

95
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,461
[SPEAKER_07]: to 7 p.m.

96
00:05:33,902 --> 00:05:38,023
[SPEAKER_07]: as presented by Brian, owner of Event Them.

97
00:05:40,264 --> 00:05:42,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, make a motion to accept this one day.

98
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:43,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

99
00:05:44,597 --> 00:05:45,638
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll second the motion.

100
00:05:46,038 --> 00:05:46,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

101
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:47,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Ben.

102
00:05:47,619 --> 00:05:48,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Bobby, for that.

103
00:05:50,341 --> 00:05:54,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, three to seven, May 5th, Sunday, 50 estimated guests.

104
00:05:54,984 --> 00:05:56,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for the motion.

105
00:05:57,426 --> 00:06:02,670
[SPEAKER_06]: All in favor of approving the one day for event them, say aye.

106
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:03,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

107
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:04,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

108
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:05,972
[SPEAKER_06]: You're all set, Brian.

109
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:09,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much for coming and joining us this afternoon.

110
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Good luck with the event.

111
00:06:11,436 --> 00:06:12,637
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you have more than 50 people.

112
00:06:14,803 --> 00:06:15,663
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back, Alan.

113
00:06:15,683 --> 00:06:16,804
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have a great afternoon.

114
00:06:17,224 --> 00:06:17,524
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

115
00:06:17,924 --> 00:06:18,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

116
00:06:18,665 --> 00:06:25,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Good luck.

117
00:06:25,148 --> 00:06:27,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Second item is 25 Salem Street LLC.

118
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Attorney Farnsworth, how are you?

119
00:06:30,071 --> 00:06:32,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Barry, I hope you're enjoying Ireland.

120
00:06:32,552 --> 00:06:35,314
[SPEAKER_06]: I certainly am, sir.

121
00:06:35,334 --> 00:06:35,774
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you?

122
00:06:36,394 --> 00:06:37,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Very well, and yourself?

123
00:06:38,782 --> 00:06:39,143
[SPEAKER_02]: All good.

124
00:06:39,223 --> 00:06:39,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

125
00:06:39,623 --> 00:06:40,204
[SPEAKER_02]: All good.

126
00:06:40,664 --> 00:06:42,487
[SPEAKER_06]: So so tell us about this.

127
00:06:44,109 --> 00:06:52,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Attorney Farnsworth or Barry, tell us that, you know, we've been hearing about this for like over a year and oh, it's an Irish pub.

128
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:54,081
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not an Irish pub.

129
00:06:54,161 --> 00:06:54,681
[SPEAKER_06]: It's it's.

130
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:56,303
[SPEAKER_06]: There is no food.

131
00:06:56,363 --> 00:06:57,243
[SPEAKER_06]: There is food.

132
00:06:57,284 --> 00:07:04,328
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you're not supposed to believe in rumors, but this is all we kept hearing for quite a while.

133
00:07:04,429 --> 00:07:08,371
[SPEAKER_06]: So we see the ABCC application.

134
00:07:08,431 --> 00:07:12,014
[SPEAKER_06]: We've looked at the diagram, the drawings, the menu.

135
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:13,255
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't wait.

136
00:07:13,635 --> 00:07:23,422
[SPEAKER_06]: But Attorney Farnsworth or Barry, do you want to give us a good overview of what the city of Medford can expect from you guys with this new establishment?

137
00:07:25,048 --> 00:07:26,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, Trish, I can take that.

138
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was going to say, go ahead.

139
00:07:29,512 --> 00:07:36,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so it's roughly a 65 seater, I'm not sure exactly what it is, but it's circa that.

140
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:44,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Restaurant, I would say, that has about, I think it's a 15 person bar.

141
00:07:45,786 --> 00:07:52,671
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a little outdoor patio area at the back that we hope to get open at the same time.

142
00:07:56,584 --> 00:08:04,028
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be a traditional Irish bar, but as far as an Irish bar is in America, it's somewhat different in Ireland.

143
00:08:04,688 --> 00:08:05,869
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's exactly where I am now.

144
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:08,730
[SPEAKER_02]: And as Trish said, I'm doing some research.

145
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:11,291
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make it as authentic as possible.

146
00:08:11,311 --> 00:08:17,495
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope for an opening date circa August, I hope.

147
00:08:19,856 --> 00:08:21,237
[SPEAKER_06]: August of this year, right?

148
00:08:21,497 --> 00:08:22,277
[SPEAKER_06]: August of this year?

149
00:08:22,297 --> 00:08:22,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, sir.

150
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:23,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

151
00:08:23,518 --> 00:08:23,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

152
00:08:24,775 --> 00:08:27,357
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be great.

153
00:08:27,877 --> 00:08:28,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that would be great.

154
00:08:30,659 --> 00:08:36,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think, you know, when I looked at that site, I liked its visibility.

155
00:08:37,323 --> 00:08:41,886
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked the size of it because I swore I wasn't going to do another big one and I won't.

156
00:08:43,427 --> 00:08:51,193
[SPEAKER_02]: On top of which, you know, I knew Tacuba and the owner managers of that property and I knew they were going to do something great beside me.

157
00:08:51,253 --> 00:08:51,613
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think

158
00:08:52,233 --> 00:08:53,855
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they'll be a good fit for each other.

159
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,378
[SPEAKER_02]: I know he's very much looking forward to it opening as well.

160
00:08:57,185 --> 00:09:00,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, a little diversity in the square.

161
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:01,206
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all good.

162
00:09:01,587 --> 00:09:03,447
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking at the application.

163
00:09:04,868 --> 00:09:10,710
[SPEAKER_06]: The 356 square foot patio outside, I didn't even know there was an outside in the back there.

164
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody does.

165
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,211
[SPEAKER_06]: I've lived in Medford all my life.

166
00:09:13,631 --> 00:09:14,071
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

167
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:17,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby, did you know anything was in the middle there in the back?

168
00:09:17,512 --> 00:09:18,433
[SPEAKER_06]: I had no clue.

169
00:09:18,973 --> 00:09:20,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I knew there was an alley there.

170
00:09:21,814 --> 00:09:24,495
[SPEAKER_05]: I think something might have came up with Takuba about,

171
00:09:26,296 --> 00:09:33,259
[SPEAKER_05]: They wouldn't allow them to transport food between the two restaurants, that and the one on the Riverside Ave, you know?

172
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:34,179
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes sense.

173
00:09:34,219 --> 00:09:34,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

174
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:35,820
[SPEAKER_05]: So I see.

175
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,721
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't think there was that much room though.

176
00:09:37,901 --> 00:09:38,461
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't either.

177
00:09:38,481 --> 00:09:39,422
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't either.

178
00:09:39,442 --> 00:09:46,325
[SPEAKER_06]: And so two stories from what I see, seating capacity 85, is that still the number you're shooting for?

179
00:09:46,365 --> 00:09:50,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I think you'd sell a little less or you would just, you know, just a small patio.

180
00:09:52,182 --> 00:09:55,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Including the patio, 85 would be very close.

181
00:09:55,705 --> 00:09:56,085
[SPEAKER_07]: I see.

182
00:09:57,686 --> 00:09:59,388
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's really just one story, right?

183
00:09:59,448 --> 00:10:01,349
[SPEAKER_07]: And just the basement is the storage, right?

184
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,972
[SPEAKER_02]: And the prep kitchen downstairs, yes.

185
00:10:05,532 --> 00:10:06,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

186
00:10:06,753 --> 00:10:07,273
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah.

187
00:10:07,914 --> 00:10:08,314
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

188
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:08,915
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

189
00:10:08,955 --> 00:10:09,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

190
00:10:09,315 --> 00:10:09,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

191
00:10:09,935 --> 00:10:15,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm looking at the plans.

192
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:15,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

193
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:24,326
[SPEAKER_05]: The downstairs storage would have alcohol refrigeration or alcohol storage.

194
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,368
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be one of the rooms that are listed?

195
00:10:28,449 --> 00:10:28,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

196
00:10:28,609 --> 00:10:28,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

197
00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:32,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's a walk-in refrigeration downstairs for that.

198
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, got it.

199
00:10:35,111 --> 00:10:46,493
[SPEAKER_06]: And just to remind my two fellow commissioners, not only is this an application for a license, a new license, but pledge of collateral, right?

200
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,833
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's also a pledge in there.

201
00:10:49,093 --> 00:10:55,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we do need to pledge where the whole build out, as you can imagine, is a significant investment.

202
00:10:56,375 --> 00:11:00,778
[SPEAKER_08]: And so Northern Bank and Trust have agreed to do that loan.

203
00:11:00,918 --> 00:11:05,180
[SPEAKER_08]: But obviously, the requirement is that the license is pledged to them.

204
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

205
00:11:06,321 --> 00:11:10,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Being a banker for 42 years with 20 fines worth, I get it.

206
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:11,544
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes sense.

207
00:11:11,664 --> 00:11:13,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it does make sense.

208
00:11:13,245 --> 00:11:14,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I ask a question?

209
00:11:14,366 --> 00:11:15,866
[SPEAKER_07]: So where is this in?

210
00:11:15,946 --> 00:11:16,767
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, this is great.

211
00:11:17,307 --> 00:11:18,568
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very exciting, by the way.

212
00:11:18,648 --> 00:11:20,109
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think it's awesome.

213
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:21,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

214
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:24,772
[SPEAKER_07]: And does this mean the Ford has been a success for you?

215
00:11:25,512 --> 00:11:25,852
[SPEAKER_07]: so far?

216
00:11:26,612 --> 00:11:53,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the forge has gotten busier and busier as the longer it's there in truth and you know I had focused, I began to focus my attention on the Irish bar about nine months ago but we still had some work to do so I continued my focus on the forge and we're in a good place there and I feel that Medford Square in particular is ready for something new and something a little bit more, a little simpler so to speak and

217
00:11:55,459 --> 00:12:00,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, my attention won't be ever taken away from the board, that's to be very clear.

218
00:12:00,643 --> 00:12:09,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, just more curious and I have to say, I don't look at it, but I'm actually really excited.

219
00:12:10,049 --> 00:12:19,316
[SPEAKER_07]: I was really happy to see this come in because I'm a resident and I complain to my wife all the time, there's nothing to eat in the square.

220
00:12:19,856 --> 00:12:23,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Or there's now like a couple of things and how it's to do to go.

221
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:25,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, so I think it's great.

222
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,121
[SPEAKER_07]: But all personal opinion aside.

223
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:31,503
[SPEAKER_07]: So is this is this as far as like a build a buildout?

224
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:36,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this submitted like, you know, for a building permit yet?

225
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:38,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is that is that sort of in the works?

226
00:12:38,248 --> 00:12:38,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

227
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:40,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's already been granted.

228
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,331
[SPEAKER_02]: In truth, they've started demolition.

229
00:12:43,631 --> 00:12:45,412
[SPEAKER_02]: They started it about six months ago.

230
00:12:46,773 --> 00:12:49,535
[SPEAKER_02]: They've done first fix on plumbing and electrics.

231
00:12:50,758 --> 00:12:58,781
[SPEAKER_02]: and a few other bits and pieces, but until I get the funding released by the bank, I can't do any further work.

232
00:12:59,282 --> 00:13:08,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, but it's already in progress, so you just need your funds in place and this project can continue.

233
00:13:08,065 --> 00:13:09,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, my contractor is ready to go.

234
00:13:09,926 --> 00:13:15,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Trish Farnsworth has done what she needs to do in relation to the ABCC.

235
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:22,231
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, once the ABCC comes through, my builders will do what they're supposed to do.

236
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:27,372
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why when I say I'd hope to open it in August sometime, I think it's realistic.

237
00:13:29,033 --> 00:13:29,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

238
00:13:29,773 --> 00:13:30,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

239
00:13:31,573 --> 00:13:32,753
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm scanning through, Bobby.

240
00:13:32,793 --> 00:13:35,054
[SPEAKER_06]: You scan through the package.

241
00:13:35,074 --> 00:13:36,554
[SPEAKER_06]: I see the note.

242
00:13:36,594 --> 00:13:37,534
[SPEAKER_06]: I see Corey.

243
00:13:37,614 --> 00:13:40,095
[SPEAKER_06]: I see passports.

244
00:13:43,042 --> 00:13:43,662
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see any.

245
00:13:43,682 --> 00:13:45,023
[SPEAKER_08]: Sage is on the call too.

246
00:13:45,123 --> 00:13:46,663
[SPEAKER_08]: So she's going to be the manager.

247
00:13:46,823 --> 00:13:47,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

248
00:13:47,783 --> 00:13:50,004
[SPEAKER_06]: I do want to hear from Ms.

249
00:13:50,024 --> 00:13:50,984
[SPEAKER_06]: McCoy also.

250
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:55,125
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just kind of going through the, I'm going through the package here.

251
00:13:55,545 --> 00:13:57,266
[SPEAKER_06]: I see a note with Northern Bank.

252
00:13:59,786 --> 00:14:01,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Is she a minority owner?

253
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:03,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Is Sage one of them?

254
00:14:04,348 --> 00:14:04,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

255
00:14:05,128 --> 00:14:05,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Not yet.

256
00:14:06,668 --> 00:14:06,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

257
00:14:07,569 --> 00:14:08,769
[SPEAKER_07]: But there are a few, right?

258
00:14:08,989 --> 00:14:11,490
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a few.

259
00:14:14,483 --> 00:14:16,444
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some investors.

260
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:17,465
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.

261
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:18,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

262
00:14:18,745 --> 00:14:18,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

263
00:14:19,446 --> 00:14:19,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

264
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:20,286
[SPEAKER_06]: It's okay.

265
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:20,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

266
00:14:20,686 --> 00:14:20,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

267
00:14:21,087 --> 00:14:21,487
[SPEAKER_06]: I see that.

268
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:23,708
[SPEAKER_06]: I see the lease with Mr. Costa.

269
00:14:31,172 --> 00:14:33,513
[SPEAKER_05]: I have some questions, Mr. Chairman.

270
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:34,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

271
00:14:34,314 --> 00:14:34,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

272
00:14:34,554 --> 00:14:35,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Go right ahead.

273
00:14:35,514 --> 00:14:37,415
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still scanning through the package.

274
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:38,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

275
00:14:39,036 --> 00:14:40,557
[SPEAKER_05]: We're with, um,

276
00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:47,056
[SPEAKER_05]: I spent some time on it and I had a few questions.

277
00:14:49,397 --> 00:14:55,361
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them being, well, you already spoke about the pledge.

278
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:58,843
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no pledge paperwork here.

279
00:15:00,323 --> 00:15:06,207
[SPEAKER_05]: There should be, let's see, application for amendment pledge of collateral.

280
00:15:08,153 --> 00:15:09,714
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all in the application.

281
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:11,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

282
00:15:11,215 --> 00:15:16,660
[SPEAKER_08]: It's question on the new license application, it's question I can tell you.

283
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:21,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Question number nine on page four of the application, that's where it is.

284
00:15:22,524 --> 00:15:26,547
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you also check off pledge, I think on the monetary transmittal form.

285
00:15:26,827 --> 00:15:27,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, you do.

286
00:15:27,868 --> 00:15:29,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Pledge of collateral and new license.

287
00:15:30,612 --> 00:15:31,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I saw you.

288
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:32,853
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

289
00:15:33,313 --> 00:15:36,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think I saw the pledge in the second.

290
00:15:36,134 --> 00:15:41,276
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how the package was pretty large and Daria broke it into two packages?

291
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:45,357
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that's in the second package, at least with mine.

292
00:15:46,597 --> 00:15:48,538
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't see any pledge paperwork at all.

293
00:15:50,076 --> 00:15:55,060
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see number nine, pledge information.

294
00:15:55,621 --> 00:16:04,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, yeah, there's a $711,000 promissory note and there's also a license pledge agreement, both Northern Bank.

295
00:16:05,904 --> 00:16:07,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, I saw that as well.

296
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:15,650
[SPEAKER_05]: But the actual paperwork from the ABCC, it's four pages that you're supposed to apply for a pledge.

297
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,691
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not filled out.

298
00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:20,473
[SPEAKER_05]: None of those four pages are with this application.

299
00:16:21,493 --> 00:16:22,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's separate.

300
00:16:22,354 --> 00:16:26,676
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's if you're just applying for a pledge separately.

301
00:16:26,836 --> 00:16:30,018
[SPEAKER_05]: This is well, you can do that.

302
00:16:30,939 --> 00:16:31,099
[SPEAKER_05]: But

303
00:16:32,352 --> 00:16:35,035
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to it's going to cost you another 200 dollars.

304
00:16:35,596 --> 00:16:39,241
[SPEAKER_05]: If you do it all on this application, it doesn't cost any more.

305
00:16:40,102 --> 00:16:41,423
[SPEAKER_05]: You only pay 1 fee of 200 dollars.

306
00:16:43,471 --> 00:16:52,857
[SPEAKER_05]: And the documents that I'm looking for is the monetary transmittal form, which is the cover page for the application for amendment pledge of collateral.

307
00:16:52,877 --> 00:17:02,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Then there's a second page, which is also state application for amendment pledge of collateral.

308
00:17:02,082 --> 00:17:06,725
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where you select either the pledge, the license, the stock or the inventory.

309
00:17:07,785 --> 00:17:17,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you need to fill out an applicant statement again, which you already have when filled out with this new license.

310
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:24,670
[SPEAKER_05]: You will also have to have an entity vote, which has the following transactions need to be checked off.

311
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:30,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Pledge of license, pledge of insurance, pledge of inventory rather, and pledge of stock.

312
00:17:30,952 --> 00:17:33,173
[SPEAKER_05]: None of those documents are attached to this.

313
00:17:33,985 --> 00:17:42,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because they're all part of the application for new license commissioner that amendment application that's amending an existing license.

314
00:17:44,052 --> 00:17:50,816
[SPEAKER_08]: So, if I was if I was going in now separately for for an amendment of an existing, but there's no existing license.

315
00:17:50,856 --> 00:17:57,061
[SPEAKER_08]: So, this is all encompassed in the 1 license new license application and you check off.

316
00:17:58,181 --> 00:17:59,681
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, that question nine.

317
00:17:59,861 --> 00:18:05,163
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you look at the vote, I have it checked off both new license and pledge.

318
00:18:05,443 --> 00:18:08,843
[SPEAKER_08]: The monetary transmittal form has both checked off.

319
00:18:10,944 --> 00:18:12,284
[SPEAKER_05]: That has both checked off.

320
00:18:12,344 --> 00:18:14,825
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did see the, the bank paperwork.

321
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:24,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I saw language in the bank paperwork for the pledge as well, but the, there's, there's two important documents and actually she's got them right here.

322
00:18:27,245 --> 00:18:27,946
[SPEAKER_05]: This is 1.

323
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:31,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know, but that's the amendment application.

324
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:32,770
[SPEAKER_08]: The amendment application.

325
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:37,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the state, but we already have an applicant statement is an entity vote.

326
00:18:37,994 --> 00:18:42,959
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you want to look at that, but it also specific for pledge.

327
00:18:43,099 --> 00:18:46,141
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the same as the entity vote in a new application.

328
00:18:47,623 --> 00:18:47,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Well.

329
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:51,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no, the entity vote.

330
00:18:52,435 --> 00:18:54,437
[SPEAKER_05]: I respectfully disagree with you.

331
00:18:54,657 --> 00:19:08,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, attorney funds with, because the only reason why is I spoke with, um, Ralph, uh, from these, the ABCC director, Mr. Sacramonio, and he said that you need this.

332
00:19:08,807 --> 00:19:11,429
[SPEAKER_05]: I spoke with him yesterday because I wasn't sure.

333
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:16,853
[SPEAKER_05]: And he says this package has got to be in with the new application package.

334
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, we're happy to put that together.

335
00:19:20,288 --> 00:19:22,433
[SPEAKER_08]: I can have Barry sign it right away.

336
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's got to be done.

337
00:19:24,719 --> 00:19:25,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely got to be done.

338
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:32,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we can't pass it with the pledge checked off unless the pledge paperwork is in it.

339
00:19:32,783 --> 00:19:35,164
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know what you're saying, application for amendment.

340
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,306
[SPEAKER_05]: That was my question.

341
00:19:37,706 --> 00:19:39,608
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why I spoke with Ralph about it.

342
00:19:39,808 --> 00:19:41,729
[SPEAKER_05]: And he says, no, you have to have that.

343
00:19:41,949 --> 00:19:44,952
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, you can do it separate, but it's going to cost another $200.

344
00:19:45,172 --> 00:19:48,034
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, this way, it's just $200.

345
00:19:48,114 --> 00:19:53,358
[SPEAKER_05]: And they can check off as many boxes as they want on the monetary transmission form.

346
00:19:53,918 --> 00:19:54,839
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just that one $200 fee.

347
00:19:57,294 --> 00:20:02,257
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, that's something that needs to get done.

348
00:20:04,378 --> 00:20:09,761
[SPEAKER_05]: The only reason being is the ABCC, as soon as they see it come through without that, they're gonna kick it back.

349
00:20:10,302 --> 00:20:20,128
[SPEAKER_05]: And they just did kick it back with, who was it, Daria, we just got one kicked back because the pledge amendment wasn't on there.

350
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:24,430
[SPEAKER_05]: I forget which one.

351
00:20:26,704 --> 00:20:35,171
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, well, that that had some that had some other issues going on too.

352
00:20:35,992 --> 00:20:40,235
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I mean, I have the, I can get, you know, I have that application paperwork.

353
00:20:40,555 --> 00:20:43,378
[SPEAKER_08]: We can submit that right away to Daria.

354
00:20:44,318 --> 00:20:45,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.

355
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,597
[SPEAKER_05]: That that you need to do.

356
00:20:47,617 --> 00:20:49,880
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's just a matter of filling up a couple of times.

357
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

358
00:20:50,821 --> 00:20:55,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Then why don't we do that to save you?

359
00:20:55,428 --> 00:21:00,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Because not only that is we'd have to have another quick hearing for to vote on the pledge.

360
00:21:00,937 --> 00:21:05,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, and it was no, the public notice clearly everything said was in there.

361
00:21:05,621 --> 00:21:07,763
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, we're covered.

362
00:21:07,783 --> 00:21:12,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well, there's a few more questions I had to go ahead.

363
00:21:12,547 --> 00:21:12,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

364
00:21:12,967 --> 00:21:22,294
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't want to move forward on them until we know now we can make a condition upon seeing the paperwork for the plants, but continue on.

365
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:24,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

366
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:25,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

367
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:33,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Collateral, okay.

368
00:21:36,488 --> 00:21:40,809
[SPEAKER_05]: I highlighted everything on it so it'd be a little easier to find.

369
00:21:40,829 --> 00:21:53,912
[SPEAKER_05]: I see all the notifications are done, the ad is done.

370
00:21:55,852 --> 00:21:57,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Application for a new license.

371
00:21:59,098 --> 00:22:13,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two, on the page one of the application for a new license, the DBA, I noticed you had it on the drawings, but there's nothing in the box here.

372
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:19,614
[SPEAKER_08]: I wasn't, yeah, I don't know if we were 100% sure on the DBA name.

373
00:22:20,254 --> 00:22:22,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Barry, you weren't sure yet, right, on the name?

374
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,551
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't, I am now.

375
00:22:25,932 --> 00:22:30,836
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm free to release that, and it's going to be called Mrs. Murphys.

376
00:22:32,717 --> 00:22:34,118
[SPEAKER_08]: MRS Murphys?

377
00:22:34,639 --> 00:22:34,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

378
00:22:35,459 --> 00:22:45,347
[SPEAKER_08]: H-Y apostrophe S. I can send Daria a new page one of that application that will have the DBA inserted.

379
00:22:45,367 --> 00:22:47,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

380
00:22:48,781 --> 00:22:52,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you'll get the four pages for the pledge.

381
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:53,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

382
00:22:55,647 --> 00:23:05,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Then as we go down a little further, let's see, page 2.

383
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,562
[SPEAKER_05]: On page 2,

384
00:23:17,224 --> 00:23:20,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, hang on a second.

385
00:23:24,189 --> 00:23:26,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Aquino, Doro Aquino?

386
00:23:28,013 --> 00:23:30,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I know, yep.

387
00:23:30,274 --> 00:23:34,658
[SPEAKER_05]: This is on the number six, Postal Office of Stock and Ownership and Interest.

388
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:38,862
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no social security numbers, no date of birth.

389
00:23:39,382 --> 00:23:41,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Same for Barry Rafferty.

390
00:23:41,404 --> 00:23:42,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there any reason why?

391
00:23:44,163 --> 00:23:49,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, yeah, I had the day the 1st, so maybe that for some reason that isn't on your copy.

392
00:23:49,405 --> 00:23:51,766
[SPEAKER_08]: There are no social security numbers though.

393
00:23:51,966 --> 00:23:52,547
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe.

394
00:23:53,887 --> 00:23:56,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Those have to be filled in.

395
00:23:57,389 --> 00:24:01,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, if there's no Barry doesn't have there, you don't have a social security number.

396
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:02,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

397
00:24:03,351 --> 00:24:03,731
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I do.

398
00:24:03,831 --> 00:24:03,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

399
00:24:04,211 --> 00:24:04,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you do.

400
00:24:04,972 --> 00:24:05,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

401
00:24:05,982 --> 00:24:07,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, just look at these queries.

402
00:24:07,783 --> 00:24:09,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I have them on the other folks?

403
00:24:09,143 --> 00:24:09,623
[SPEAKER_08]: I have.

404
00:24:09,864 --> 00:24:11,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

405
00:24:11,664 --> 00:24:12,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I have.

406
00:24:12,304 --> 00:24:15,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Caitlin, Frederick, you have data breadth, social security.

407
00:24:15,706 --> 00:24:17,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, I have them on everyone.

408
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:18,747
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can.

409
00:24:19,267 --> 00:24:22,628
[SPEAKER_03]: No, so you're missing Daro as well as Musio.

410
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:24,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Martin.

411
00:24:25,049 --> 00:24:27,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I have them on their query forms though.

412
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:31,372
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know why it's missing on that page too, but I can fill all of this in.

413
00:24:34,357 --> 00:24:35,637
[SPEAKER_05]: And so those are.

414
00:24:35,657 --> 00:24:37,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Dataverse and social security numbers.

415
00:24:37,498 --> 00:24:37,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

416
00:24:37,858 --> 00:24:38,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for that.

417
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:39,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

418
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:40,219
[SPEAKER_08]: That was not.

419
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:46,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you don't want ABCC to see that and kick it out because of that.

420
00:24:47,781 --> 00:24:49,302
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, another thing.

421
00:24:51,362 --> 00:25:02,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Barry, well, Barry, through the chair, is the Ford the only other license in the state of Massachusetts that you are affiliated with in any way?

422
00:25:02,726 --> 00:25:02,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

423
00:25:05,297 --> 00:25:06,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

424
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:12,763
[SPEAKER_05]: On page 3, number 7, occupancy of premise.

425
00:25:14,664 --> 00:25:16,846
[SPEAKER_05]: You see John Costas is the landlord.

426
00:25:17,086 --> 00:25:19,588
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lease.

427
00:25:20,689 --> 00:25:22,791
[SPEAKER_05]: The landlord's phone number is blank.

428
00:25:23,611 --> 00:25:25,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Landlord email is blank.

429
00:25:26,013 --> 00:25:27,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Landlord address is blank.

430
00:25:28,977 --> 00:25:30,698
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, God forbid there's a fire there.

431
00:25:30,778 --> 00:25:32,099
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't get a hold of Barry.

432
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:34,220
[SPEAKER_05]: We got to call the landlord, whatever.

433
00:25:35,021 --> 00:25:39,864
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what reasons they'd need it for, but the boxes are there and they're all blank.

434
00:25:40,144 --> 00:25:41,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Could they be filled in?

435
00:25:42,425 --> 00:25:43,126
[SPEAKER_08]: I can get that.

436
00:25:43,206 --> 00:25:45,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Barry, do you have his contact info?

437
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:47,569
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see it in the lease.

438
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:48,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.

439
00:25:48,769 --> 00:25:50,490
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have his address, but I'll text him.

440
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:50,871
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get us.

441
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:51,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

442
00:25:51,391 --> 00:25:51,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

443
00:25:51,811 --> 00:25:51,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

444
00:25:53,492 --> 00:25:53,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

445
00:25:53,933 --> 00:25:55,273
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's landline.

446
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:55,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

447
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:10,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we go to page 4, financial disclosure.

448
00:26:10,662 --> 00:26:16,084
[SPEAKER_05]: We go to source of cash contribution.

449
00:26:19,646 --> 00:26:28,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Other officers, stock or ownership interests are not listed in name of contributor in the amount that they're contributing.

450
00:26:29,237 --> 00:26:39,304
[SPEAKER_05]: You have three or four investors listed here that are supposed to be there with the amount they're contributing along with pictures of their accounts or where the money's coming from.

451
00:26:40,244 --> 00:26:41,245
[SPEAKER_05]: None of that's listed.

452
00:26:41,445 --> 00:26:44,307
[SPEAKER_05]: We never received any bank statements or anything as well.

453
00:26:47,149 --> 00:26:52,513
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have Northern Bank and Trust for $711 for the term.

454
00:26:53,353 --> 00:26:58,817
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's no other, the other financial interest parties are not even listed.

455
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:09,552
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess Attorney Farnsworth, are there other parties with a financial interest in the new restaurant?

456
00:27:11,653 --> 00:27:14,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Barry has these other folks.

457
00:27:14,353 --> 00:27:16,974
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the Molloy's.

458
00:27:19,015 --> 00:27:20,175
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just jump in there.

459
00:27:20,635 --> 00:27:22,195
[SPEAKER_02]: The Molloy's are the only investors.

460
00:27:22,255 --> 00:27:29,197
[SPEAKER_02]: The two Aquino brothers are my contractors and they want to work with me going forward.

461
00:27:29,962 --> 00:27:32,024
[SPEAKER_02]: and there is no financial contribution from them.

462
00:27:32,044 --> 00:27:40,893
[SPEAKER_02]: So the financial contribution was from the Malloy, Caitlin and Ricky Malloy for 250,000.

463
00:27:41,373 --> 00:27:45,578
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know what paperwork.

464
00:27:45,598 --> 00:27:52,485
[SPEAKER_06]: So we should, we should, you should disclose that on the application and provide supporting documents for ABCC.

465
00:27:53,818 --> 00:28:03,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Barry will need to show with the 2250,000 a copy of the check or deposit or, you know, from the financials.

466
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:04,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine, fine.

467
00:28:06,311 --> 00:28:12,378
[SPEAKER_05]: And my suggestion, I don't know if the other commissioners would agree.

468
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:29,172
[SPEAKER_05]: but the two Aquino's that are five percent of ownership, according to page 2 of proposed offices stock or ownership interest, the five percent each, whatever that,

469
00:28:30,048 --> 00:28:52,676
[SPEAKER_05]: dollar volume is, it should be located or documented under financial disclosures with their name and what the amount of contracting bothering or how much contracting worth they're giving to the establishment.

470
00:28:53,457 --> 00:28:58,780
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you're making them a 5% partner because of doing the contracting work.

471
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,062
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there should be a number in there somewhere.

472
00:29:01,582 --> 00:29:07,586
[SPEAKER_05]: And even if you say a partner for contracting X number of dollars worth of work, I don't know.

473
00:29:07,646 --> 00:29:08,686
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how that would work.

474
00:29:08,766 --> 00:29:09,627
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not a lawyer.

475
00:29:10,227 --> 00:29:11,408
[SPEAKER_05]: That's attorney Farnsworth.

476
00:29:11,788 --> 00:29:13,069
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I don't know.

477
00:29:13,389 --> 00:29:17,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we could just say that they're, you know, sweat equity partners.

478
00:29:18,352 --> 00:29:18,952
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

479
00:29:18,972 --> 00:29:23,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I don't want to confuse the ABCC because that's really source of cash

480
00:29:23,415 --> 00:29:27,978
[SPEAKER_08]: cash contribution because they're always just trying to track the money.

481
00:29:28,719 --> 00:29:30,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you can wordsmith that.

482
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:30,740
[SPEAKER_06]: You're right.

483
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweat equity or builders equity, something like that.

484
00:29:34,463 --> 00:29:40,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, something's got to be in there because they are listed as ownership interest.

485
00:29:40,567 --> 00:29:41,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

486
00:29:41,428 --> 00:29:44,670
[SPEAKER_08]: We were disclosing them because they are in fact owners.

487
00:29:58,102 --> 00:29:59,982
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems to be a lot there, Bobby.

488
00:30:00,042 --> 00:30:00,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Good catch.

489
00:30:02,023 --> 00:30:03,763
[SPEAKER_05]: I still got more, Mr. Chairman.

490
00:30:04,143 --> 00:30:05,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

491
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:14,565
[SPEAKER_06]: With what we've seen now, I would surmise that they would kick this back to you and then you go back and forth and you come back to us.

492
00:30:14,645 --> 00:30:16,305
[SPEAKER_06]: But go ahead, Bobby.

493
00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:19,346
[SPEAKER_06]: You have some more items that caught your attention?

494
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:22,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I did actually.

495
00:30:23,146 --> 00:30:25,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Next was the pledge, but we already discussed that.

496
00:30:28,416 --> 00:30:29,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

497
00:30:44,049 --> 00:30:44,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

498
00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:52,215
[SPEAKER_05]: I got on the entity vote.

499
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:57,066
[SPEAKER_05]: It's page 18 of the PDF1.

500
00:30:57,667 --> 00:31:00,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I have that.

501
00:31:06,691 --> 00:31:07,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

502
00:31:09,872 --> 00:31:11,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, entity vote.

503
00:31:13,133 --> 00:31:18,476
[SPEAKER_05]: At the very top, the third line down, I think you're meant to put in March 1st instead of March 1st.

504
00:31:20,529 --> 00:31:23,570
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, yeah, okay, we can fix that.

505
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Small error, nothing big.

506
00:31:26,411 --> 00:31:28,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Voted to a point, you left it blank.

507
00:31:29,051 --> 00:31:31,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, saves needs to be put in there.

508
00:31:31,872 --> 00:31:32,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

509
00:31:33,453 --> 00:31:41,195
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's an awful lot of blank things and, you know, I was going to make a motion just to table this till next month because a lot of it's not even here.

510
00:31:41,575 --> 00:31:45,336
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, especially the pledge.

511
00:31:45,376 --> 00:31:46,456
[SPEAKER_05]: The pledge is a big deal.

512
00:31:48,879 --> 00:31:54,083
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can't vote to put it through without this thing being completed.

513
00:31:54,283 --> 00:31:55,785
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not completed the way it should be.

514
00:31:58,187 --> 00:32:00,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't know about you other fellows.

515
00:32:00,969 --> 00:32:05,873
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, believe me, I just want to see it do it right so you don't have any issues.

516
00:32:06,937 --> 00:32:08,377
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to see you have any issues.

517
00:32:08,417 --> 00:32:11,078
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to come back to us from the ABCC.

518
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:11,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Why didn't you pick up this?

519
00:32:11,918 --> 00:32:14,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Why didn't you pick up that?

520
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:19,059
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of these things, it's just minor, but it's got to be done.

521
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:25,001
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see this project continue moving forward.

522
00:32:26,221 --> 00:32:28,241
[SPEAKER_06]: But you're right, there's quite a few omissions.

523
00:32:28,961 --> 00:32:32,002
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Attorney Farnsworth has been taking notes.

524
00:32:32,042 --> 00:32:32,842
[SPEAKER_06]: I see her hands up.

525
00:32:33,102 --> 00:32:33,782
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

526
00:32:33,802 --> 00:32:36,063
[SPEAKER_08]: We can turn this around today.

527
00:32:36,423 --> 00:32:38,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's kind of what I was hoping you'd say.

528
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:50,351
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm thinking that if the other two commissioners are agreeable, that let Attorney Farnsworth rework the package, get it to Daria.

529
00:32:50,411 --> 00:32:55,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Daria, if you don't mind, send it to the three of us, and we can kind of review it.

530
00:32:55,694 --> 00:32:58,776
[SPEAKER_06]: We could put something in the notes that we've looked at it.

531
00:32:58,836 --> 00:33:00,177
[SPEAKER_06]: We've seen some omissions.

532
00:33:00,197 --> 00:33:01,398
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to get addressed.

533
00:33:02,078 --> 00:33:06,119
[SPEAKER_06]: and we'll revisit it as soon as possible.

534
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,480
[SPEAKER_06]: That way we don't have to delay this another month.

535
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:10,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Daria, what do you think?

536
00:33:13,502 --> 00:33:14,282
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine with me.

537
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:15,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

538
00:33:15,763 --> 00:33:16,603
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fine with you guys.

539
00:33:16,683 --> 00:33:17,804
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fine with whatever.

540
00:33:18,444 --> 00:33:18,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

541
00:33:18,704 --> 00:33:20,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm good with that as well.

542
00:33:20,385 --> 00:33:30,008
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, these are all points, you know, Commissioner Delfano is bringing up and, you know, he also went to the trouble of talking to the ABCC kind of like,

543
00:33:30,578 --> 00:33:38,461
[SPEAKER_07]: for, you know, on behalf of you, in a way, to make sure that, like, it was gonna go through and, you know, and it looks like it would have been kicked back.

544
00:33:38,521 --> 00:33:43,123
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do think he saved you a step in bringing all these things up, too.

545
00:33:44,403 --> 00:33:52,546
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think it is, you know, if it can be turned around quickly and back to us while everything is still fresh in our, you know, memory, I think it's reasonable.

546
00:33:53,567 --> 00:33:58,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I would like to see it proceed as well, you know, assuming all these boxes get checked.

547
00:33:58,168 --> 00:33:59,389
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's how I feel about it.

548
00:34:00,458 --> 00:34:03,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I really don't want to tie it up for another month as well.

549
00:34:03,642 --> 00:34:05,865
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the forward.

550
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:07,026
[SPEAKER_05]: I dine in there.

551
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:10,450
[SPEAKER_05]: I patronize the place and it's a great place.

552
00:34:10,831 --> 00:34:17,178
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think this place in Medford square is going to be just as good with the management and everything that.

553
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:23,902
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, everything about it, it seems to work, but that's why I just want to make sure we've got it all.

554
00:34:24,242 --> 00:34:29,905
[SPEAKER_05]: I, you know, I started T's cross to just just get it done in 1 thing.

555
00:34:29,965 --> 00:34:43,630
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, yeah, attorney found where they like, like the chairman and the other commissioners stated is as long as it's all corrected, you get it back to Gary or she can email it to us individually.

556
00:34:44,071 --> 00:34:47,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, we can't me, um,

557
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:51,451
[SPEAKER_05]: together or converse together versus emails.

558
00:34:52,271 --> 00:35:03,093
[SPEAKER_05]: So if any of us has any issues, we have to just go back and forth one-on-one to Darrier and then until it gets resolved.

559
00:35:04,034 --> 00:35:05,274
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, in the meeting, it's great.

560
00:35:05,314 --> 00:35:09,575
[SPEAKER_05]: We can all talk openly like this, but outside the meeting, as you know, we can't.

561
00:35:10,915 --> 00:35:17,302
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we do find anything odd or strange, we'll go through Daria.

562
00:35:17,322 --> 00:35:21,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Daria will reach out to you, Attorney Farnsworth, and that's kind of how it would work.

563
00:35:21,205 --> 00:35:24,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully, you'll make sure everything is— Oh, yeah.

564
00:35:24,749 --> 00:35:27,392
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to go through it now with a fine-tooth comb.

565
00:35:27,572 --> 00:35:27,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

566
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:28,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

567
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:29,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Good, good, good.

568
00:35:30,412 --> 00:35:48,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so let's- Mr. Chairman, I just want to let you know that I can, and Daria and Ben, on this page, on this PDF1, I kind of highlighted everything and I'll send a copy to Daria and she can send it out to you guys.

569
00:35:48,342 --> 00:35:55,566
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we get the new paperwork, it'll be easy for you just to reference what we're looking for and make sure it was taken care of.

570
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:57,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

571
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,561
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a great idea.

572
00:35:59,601 --> 00:36:09,547
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you should definitely do that, because Bobby's very thorough, so I'm sure that'll point to everything that needs to be updated, and hopefully we don't have to do all that email circle, because that's always tough.

573
00:36:09,828 --> 00:36:11,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, it's a pain.

574
00:36:12,209 --> 00:36:15,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, great.

575
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:16,172
[SPEAKER_02]: I beg your pardon.

576
00:36:16,792 --> 00:36:18,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I just have one thing to say, if that's okay?

577
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:23,397
[SPEAKER_02]: So, first of all, I serve beer for a living, and unfortunately,

578
00:36:25,032 --> 00:36:31,158
[SPEAKER_02]: few clerical errors that are there, you know, to Tricia's word, she said she'll have it all back to Daria today.

579
00:36:31,178 --> 00:36:37,444
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's any concerns in relation to my work or what we're doing, I'd love to know now.

580
00:36:37,464 --> 00:36:38,405
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope there's not.

581
00:36:39,386 --> 00:36:45,412
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do feel sure that whatever information that was requested there would be provided within the next two hours.

582
00:36:47,841 --> 00:36:49,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, that's fine with me.

583
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:58,347
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have any issues with the, I mean, Alan, the financing stuff is your forte, banking stuff rather.

584
00:36:58,407 --> 00:37:00,228
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's not my forte.

585
00:37:00,248 --> 00:37:06,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Ben, the building stuff, that's your forte.

586
00:37:06,532 --> 00:37:13,616
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just a retired old guy that's got nothing better to do than read this thing and try and pull it apart, but, you know.

587
00:37:13,696 --> 00:37:14,237
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm grateful.

588
00:37:14,912 --> 00:37:18,634
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I am too, because I, you know, I do these applications.

589
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:23,676
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why some of these things missing, but the pledge separate paperwork is news to me.

590
00:37:23,816 --> 00:37:25,377
[SPEAKER_08]: So, but that's fine.

591
00:37:25,517 --> 00:37:26,837
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll, you know, we'll do that.

592
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:36,762
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to do any funds with, I can, I can send a link to Daria with the paperwork I'm talking about.

593
00:37:37,242 --> 00:38:00,597
[SPEAKER_05]: I have it I do have the pledge amendment application okay it's just four pages you know it's it's that's all that's required with it and yeah that's that's basically about it I mean I don't think it's anything it'll be resolved by the time we finish our meeting we we got a few minutes at the end of this then a couple of matters that we have to go over with the

594
00:38:02,098 --> 00:38:08,985
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, posting of, uh, of, of, uh, the deadlines and stuff for the 48 hour ramp, the 48 hour rule.

595
00:38:09,085 --> 00:38:21,156
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I don't think you're going to get your stuff that quick, but just send it to Daria and we'll review it and get it back to you or back to Daria as soon as ASAP.

596
00:38:23,059 --> 00:38:23,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

597
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Makes sense.

598
00:38:27,564 --> 00:38:27,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

599
00:38:27,784 --> 00:38:32,428
[SPEAKER_06]: McCoy, we'd like to hear from you a little background.

600
00:38:32,468 --> 00:38:36,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell us a little history if you're still there.

601
00:38:36,973 --> 00:38:40,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I'm here.

602
00:38:40,977 --> 00:38:43,079
[SPEAKER_00]: So background about myself or?

603
00:38:43,099 --> 00:38:46,623
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a little about yourself, your experience in the industry.

604
00:38:47,288 --> 00:38:51,492
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so I've been working with Barry at the Ford since before it opened.

605
00:38:52,033 --> 00:39:01,242
[SPEAKER_00]: Previous to that, I was running River Bar in Somerville, but been taking hold of the Ford, getting it, you know, operational and functioning and profitable.

606
00:39:01,262 --> 00:39:02,643
[SPEAKER_00]: So is always the goal.

607
00:39:02,703 --> 00:39:06,007
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll be doing the same for the pub when that opens, hopefully in August.

608
00:39:08,936 --> 00:39:10,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

609
00:39:10,817 --> 00:39:14,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, we just wanted to get you on record some of your information.

610
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,840
[SPEAKER_06]: I thank you.

611
00:39:20,482 --> 00:39:35,651
[SPEAKER_06]: We can make a motion to table 25 Salem Street LLC until the package with all the tweaks are taken care of and then we can review it again.

612
00:39:37,464 --> 00:40:02,711
[SPEAKER_08]: okay i mean i guess because do you have to vote though mr chair because if you don't vote the three of you now right i i don't know how you guys work but do i just don't want to have to wait a whole nother month i mean i guess it would be you would vote to approve pending you know receipt of the proper documentation or something i guess uh i don't know um that's what i thought

613
00:40:03,536 --> 00:40:03,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sorry.

614
00:40:04,677 --> 00:40:09,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, that's I was saying, you know, we could we could approve this conditionally condition on.

615
00:40:09,683 --> 00:40:12,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that was my understanding of it.

616
00:40:12,247 --> 00:40:13,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry for me speak.

617
00:40:13,108 --> 00:40:15,671
[SPEAKER_07]: That was just my understanding of it to that if.

618
00:40:16,827 --> 00:40:19,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Very valid points, very good catch on all of this.

619
00:40:19,849 --> 00:40:40,763
[SPEAKER_07]: But if our hang up is on the paperwork and paperwork does come through, and like Barry asked, if we don't have any other real concerns about granting the license because of him or because of Sage or anybody else, and then I think I would be OK with approving it conditional on that paperwork coming back.

620
00:40:41,597 --> 00:40:48,099
[SPEAKER_07]: But like we said, if it doesn't, for some reason it doesn't come back, there's too many questions, it could get tabled until the next month.

621
00:40:48,419 --> 00:40:49,239
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, for sure.

622
00:40:49,539 --> 00:40:50,279
[SPEAKER_07]: So hopefully it doesn't.

623
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby, your thoughts on that?

624
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:57,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you okay with the conditional approval or no?

625
00:40:57,241 --> 00:41:00,982
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm okay with the conditional approval.

626
00:41:01,002 --> 00:41:07,104
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as, you know, I'm just like attorney Farnsworth says, how do we do this?

627
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we vote again?

628
00:41:11,852 --> 00:41:19,374
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe individually to Daria versus email once we receive everything, review it.

629
00:41:20,054 --> 00:41:23,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Daria will forward us all those papers.

630
00:41:23,654 --> 00:41:25,155
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll read it if I like it.

631
00:41:25,335 --> 00:41:25,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

632
00:41:25,955 --> 00:41:26,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

633
00:41:26,315 --> 00:41:26,775
[SPEAKER_05]: All is good.

634
00:41:27,195 --> 00:41:27,735
[SPEAKER_05]: I approve.

635
00:41:28,015 --> 00:41:29,376
[SPEAKER_05]: I email it back to Daria.

636
00:41:30,376 --> 00:41:31,176
[SPEAKER_05]: You do the same.

637
00:41:31,756 --> 00:41:32,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Ben does the same.

638
00:41:32,936 --> 00:41:36,877
[SPEAKER_05]: But is that legal with all of this open meeting law stuff?

639
00:41:37,017 --> 00:41:37,517
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

640
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:40,118
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what the

641
00:41:42,341 --> 00:41:43,902
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure either.

642
00:41:44,262 --> 00:41:45,242
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure either.

643
00:41:45,262 --> 00:41:53,287
[SPEAKER_06]: But we've done that in the past, and we've never heard from KP law telling us that what we're doing is not

644
00:41:54,392 --> 00:41:54,993
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, right?

645
00:41:55,253 --> 00:41:57,316
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't have a problem with it.

646
00:41:57,556 --> 00:42:02,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I say, you know, where, you know, where Zoom is, you know, is a brave new world.

647
00:42:02,542 --> 00:42:04,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's continue doing it.

648
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:06,407
[SPEAKER_06]: We have been doing it until K.P.

649
00:42:06,447 --> 00:42:12,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Law or we finally get a city solicitor that tells us, no, stop doing it that way.

650
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I don't have an issue with it.

651
00:42:16,521 --> 00:42:16,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

652
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:25,644
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically, it's diarrhea can't turn this paperwork into the ABC anyways, unless all 3 of us approve via email.

653
00:42:25,664 --> 00:42:26,864
[SPEAKER_05]: So correct.

654
00:42:27,164 --> 00:42:31,806
[SPEAKER_05]: If it was conditionally approved, it's, it's basically, I don't see any issues with it.

655
00:42:32,375 --> 00:42:33,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, good.

656
00:42:33,576 --> 00:42:43,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Then one of the two of you make a motion to conditionally approve the new license application and the pledge, and then we'll go from there.

657
00:42:45,745 --> 00:42:46,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby, you or me?

658
00:42:48,427 --> 00:42:48,747
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?

659
00:42:49,207 --> 00:42:49,608
[SPEAKER_05]: You or me?

660
00:42:50,454 --> 00:42:51,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, why don't you do it, Ben?

661
00:42:51,815 --> 00:42:52,096
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

662
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:52,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

663
00:42:53,197 --> 00:42:53,497
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

664
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:54,879
[SPEAKER_07]: So let me see if I can get this right.

665
00:42:54,939 --> 00:43:00,684
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to make a motion to approve the application for the new license.

666
00:43:01,926 --> 00:43:04,428
[SPEAKER_07]: The entity name is 225 Salem Street LLC.

667
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:04,568
[SPEAKER_07]: The

668
00:43:10,232 --> 00:43:14,994
[SPEAKER_07]: The address is, sorry, not 225, 25, sorry.

669
00:43:15,534 --> 00:43:19,276
[SPEAKER_07]: The address, 25 Salem Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

670
00:43:20,157 --> 00:43:34,943
[SPEAKER_07]: This is for a new license per the description and the plans that have been submitted on this application by Barry Rafferty.

671
00:43:37,435 --> 00:43:47,846
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is going to be conditionally based on the completion, the proper completion of this package, which is going to include all of the.

672
00:43:49,645 --> 00:44:04,111
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, the additional owners, uh, financial information we've requested from the additional owners, as well as some additional information we've requested with landlord information, um, and- and so on, as we've, uh, requested.

673
00:44:04,131 --> 00:44:18,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, so- so to summarize that, uh, we're gonna make a motion to approve this on the condition that we, uh, receive in a prompt amount of time, reasonable amount of time, um, all that additional follow-up information.

674
00:44:18,936 --> 00:44:23,799
[SPEAKER_06]: And can we insert the pledge, the pledge four pages for the pledge?

675
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:35,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, sorry, as well as that four page pledge collateral, which is available on the ABCC.

676
00:44:36,046 --> 00:44:43,490
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we could basically just say all of the things we discussed that needed to be, because there's six or seven things here.

677
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:44,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, correct, correct.

678
00:44:45,011 --> 00:44:45,832
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the motion.

679
00:44:45,852 --> 00:44:45,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

680
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:50,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I'll second that motion.

681
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:51,471
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

682
00:44:51,511 --> 00:44:52,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Jerry, did you get all that?

683
00:44:54,594 --> 00:44:54,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

684
00:44:55,254 --> 00:44:55,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

685
00:44:55,595 --> 00:44:55,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

686
00:44:56,355 --> 00:45:01,360
[SPEAKER_06]: All in favor of accepting the motion, say aye.

687
00:45:02,541 --> 00:45:02,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

688
00:45:03,122 --> 00:45:03,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

689
00:45:03,622 --> 00:45:04,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

690
00:45:04,812 --> 00:45:08,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so, Attorney Farnsworth, you have a big homework assignment.

691
00:45:08,513 --> 00:45:10,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we have it.

692
00:45:10,153 --> 00:45:12,334
[SPEAKER_06]: And to get it back to us as quickly as possible.

693
00:45:13,054 --> 00:45:24,337
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, as Commissioner Delafarno said, we'll each look at it, and if we have any questions or concerns, we'll send them through Daria, and Daria will reach out to you.

694
00:45:24,357 --> 00:45:25,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, perfect.

695
00:45:26,818 --> 00:45:27,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, very good.

696
00:45:28,579 --> 00:45:28,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

697
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:30,079
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, thank you, thank you.

698
00:45:30,619 --> 00:45:31,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you all.

699
00:45:31,239 --> 00:45:31,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

700
00:45:38,765 --> 00:45:39,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry about that, everybody.

701
00:45:40,085 --> 00:45:40,626
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.

702
00:45:40,866 --> 00:45:43,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are good catches.

703
00:45:46,107 --> 00:45:58,131
[SPEAKER_06]: If we didn't head that off now and ABCC got it, do you think ABCC would just kick it back to them with highlight or notes saying this is incomplete, take another crack at it?

704
00:46:00,368 --> 00:46:05,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they kick it back, you know, saying that, what do they call it?

705
00:46:05,753 --> 00:46:09,957
[SPEAKER_05]: No action.

706
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:13,180
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's only going to delay it a lot longer.

707
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:16,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because they will have to come back to us.

708
00:46:16,423 --> 00:46:16,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

709
00:46:17,644 --> 00:46:20,886
[SPEAKER_06]: I thank you for your eagle eyes.

710
00:46:21,227 --> 00:46:22,908
[SPEAKER_06]: You caught a lot of things.

711
00:46:24,209 --> 00:46:29,473
[SPEAKER_06]: It is interesting that some things on the application auto-populate and some don't.

712
00:46:29,533 --> 00:46:36,478
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, like why would some of the social securities and data birds carry over from the other sections, but some of them don't?

713
00:46:36,598 --> 00:46:38,319
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, I don't know.

714
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,622
[SPEAKER_05]: I think she just forgot to put them in the application.

715
00:46:42,042 --> 00:46:43,363
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they were on the quipping.

716
00:46:44,423 --> 00:46:48,386
[SPEAKER_05]: And all she needed to do is just log them in.

717
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:52,208
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what a lot of this stuff was.

718
00:46:52,629 --> 00:46:58,092
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the date of the, I forgot to tell them too, on the entity vote, the date of the meeting.

719
00:46:58,813 --> 00:47:04,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe, Darry, you can make a note on that, the entity vote on page,

720
00:47:07,197 --> 00:47:09,360
[SPEAKER_05]: 18, what was that?

721
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:09,901
[SPEAKER_05]: 18, yeah.

722
00:47:10,362 --> 00:47:11,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Third line down, it says come.

723
00:47:11,904 --> 00:47:12,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, voted to appoint.

724
00:47:13,567 --> 00:47:14,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the date of their meeting.

725
00:47:14,829 --> 00:47:19,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, yeah, what it says on March, March, start of March.

726
00:47:20,352 --> 00:47:21,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Notch for us.

727
00:47:21,573 --> 00:47:22,313
[SPEAKER_05]: I did bring that up.

728
00:47:22,393 --> 00:47:23,254
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Notch.

729
00:47:23,414 --> 00:47:25,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you did say that.

730
00:47:27,356 --> 00:47:32,239
[SPEAKER_06]: That form, is that an interactive PDF?

731
00:47:32,479 --> 00:47:38,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Or is it a dummy thing where you just print it down and then you enter the information in there?

732
00:47:38,503 --> 00:47:41,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Jerry, do you know if that's interactive on ABCC?

733
00:47:44,306 --> 00:47:46,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Some yes and some are no.

734
00:47:46,167 --> 00:47:46,287
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

735
00:47:48,548 --> 00:47:53,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the one that I'm looking at, a Pledge of Collateral, you can definitely.

736
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:55,291
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interactive.

737
00:47:55,411 --> 00:47:57,531
[SPEAKER_03]: You can just open it up and type right into it.

738
00:47:58,012 --> 00:47:58,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

739
00:47:58,752 --> 00:47:59,052
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

740
00:47:59,772 --> 00:48:01,213
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know some are not.

741
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:01,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

742
00:48:01,853 --> 00:48:02,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

743
00:48:02,693 --> 00:48:03,034
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

744
00:48:03,854 --> 00:48:04,874
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

745
00:48:04,894 --> 00:48:05,435
[SPEAKER_06]: This was good.

746
00:48:05,475 --> 00:48:07,735
[SPEAKER_06]: This was a good exercise.

747
00:48:07,815 --> 00:48:13,057
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope Attorney Farnsworth completes it and gets it back to us as quickly as possible.

748
00:48:15,186 --> 00:48:19,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby, I wanted to come back to that item on the agenda.

749
00:48:20,387 --> 00:48:23,508
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't quite following the spirit of it.

750
00:48:24,228 --> 00:48:26,768
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we had talked about it some time back.

751
00:48:27,008 --> 00:48:38,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it more so that people aren't just dropping things off at the last second, like Monday at 2 o'clock and they're dropping something off for the Tuesday hearing?

752
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:41,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that the spirit of that whole item?

753
00:48:46,351 --> 00:48:47,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Hang on one second, Al.

754
00:48:47,412 --> 00:48:48,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

755
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:03,066
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman, I know you had to answer something.

756
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:04,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry.

757
00:49:05,329 --> 00:49:11,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, basically what's happening is it seems like every month that

758
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:26,408
[SPEAKER_05]: That we're having a meeting the morning of the meeting, we're getting 2, 3 applications for 1 day licenses and, um, you know, not only is it against the 48 hour meeting open meeting law.

759
00:49:27,567 --> 00:49:34,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, all that has to be in 48 hours before the meeting takes place, excluding weekends and holidays.

760
00:49:34,989 --> 00:49:37,749
[SPEAKER_05]: So poor Daria's getting hammered left and right.

761
00:49:37,929 --> 00:49:39,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Then she's sending them out to us.

762
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:45,411
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying to read them, uh, 10 minutes before the meeting.

763
00:49:45,491 --> 00:49:50,092
[SPEAKER_05]: And it seemed to be the same people kind of doing it all the time.

764
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:53,293
[SPEAKER_05]: So we, we, we left it as a, uh,

765
00:49:54,256 --> 00:49:54,796
[SPEAKER_05]: I got Ralph.

766
00:49:54,957 --> 00:49:56,878
[SPEAKER_05]: I got Ralph Sacramone calling me.

767
00:49:56,938 --> 00:49:58,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want me to take it?

768
00:50:01,762 --> 00:50:02,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Just mute everything.

769
00:50:04,464 --> 00:50:06,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Daria, do you like this idea?

770
00:50:07,006 --> 00:50:12,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think this would help you be more efficient with the hearings?

771
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:15,572
[SPEAKER_06]: If we said, look, it's got to be Friday before the Tuesday?

772
00:50:15,592 --> 00:50:16,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

773
00:50:18,745 --> 00:50:22,488
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Friday would be ideal by like 11 a.m.

774
00:50:22,668 --> 00:50:24,869
[SPEAKER_03]: So this way, because I want to get it to you.

775
00:50:24,889 --> 00:50:32,915
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to have the agenda sent to you guys plus the documents because I know it's a lot sometimes and I don't want to send it to you on Tuesday or Monday.

776
00:50:33,055 --> 00:50:35,576
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to have it ready for Friday like I did this Friday.

777
00:50:36,517 --> 00:50:43,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes when I get things last minute, it prevents me from sending it all at the same time because I'm getting it all at different times.

778
00:50:44,735 --> 00:50:49,297
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's better off have a deadline, which is Friday, let's say 11am.

779
00:50:49,317 --> 00:50:55,679
[SPEAKER_03]: So it gives me till 1230 to scan everything in and to get it to you guys before the end of the day here.

780
00:50:56,159 --> 00:50:56,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

781
00:50:56,980 --> 00:51:02,942
[SPEAKER_06]: So then you have the weekend and then yeah, I know I like I like that idea because sometimes Monday's a holiday.

782
00:51:03,882 --> 00:51:05,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like this Monday was a holiday.

783
00:51:05,503 --> 00:51:14,648
[SPEAKER_03]: So I didn't, you know, if I come back on Tuesday, I get bombarded with, I mean, this Tuesday didn't happen, but a couple of Tuesdays I'll be getting everything.

784
00:51:14,708 --> 00:51:18,410
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, I'm trying to catch up from my work plus places.

785
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:22,152
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't wanna, I don't think it's fair for me to send you guys last minute items either.

786
00:51:22,492 --> 00:51:24,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, no, I like the idea.

787
00:51:25,273 --> 00:51:26,393
[SPEAKER_06]: I only wish I thought of it.

788
00:51:26,913 --> 00:51:30,694
[SPEAKER_06]: So I say that's fine.

789
00:51:31,674 --> 00:51:40,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's use that as long as we all are on the same page so nobody's calling us on a Monday or a Tuesday morning saying, oh, I forgot.

790
00:51:41,436 --> 00:51:47,277
[SPEAKER_06]: And the event's going to be before the next meeting, your next licensed meeting.

791
00:51:49,338 --> 00:51:49,918
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.

792
00:51:50,278 --> 00:52:02,025
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll stick with that protocol and we'll do our best to get the repeat offenders in a routine so they know not to pull any last minute items.

793
00:52:02,606 --> 00:52:06,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Dara, I haven't been tracking this.

794
00:52:06,188 --> 00:52:14,653
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's only April, but event them, Brian seems to be, his business, his entity keeps

795
00:52:15,313 --> 00:52:28,592
[SPEAKER_06]: growing and involving and he has so many different events do we do we track because it's my understanding we will only issue up to 31 day licenses for any entity do we do we keep track of event them

796
00:52:30,212 --> 00:52:31,672
[SPEAKER_03]: He knows per calendar year.

797
00:52:31,692 --> 00:52:33,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Him and I are actually going to talk tomorrow.

798
00:52:33,973 --> 00:52:41,314
[SPEAKER_03]: We're supposed to talk beginning of the year, but then he got sick and then it got all delayed because sometimes it's under him.

799
00:52:41,394 --> 00:52:44,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it's under JJ Cuisine.

800
00:52:45,015 --> 00:52:45,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

801
00:52:45,235 --> 00:52:49,416
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to explain to him how that works plus non-profit and profit.

802
00:52:49,636 --> 00:52:51,276
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's clear on that.

803
00:52:51,656 --> 00:52:51,896
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

804
00:52:51,916 --> 00:52:53,676
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to talk about it tomorrow.

805
00:52:54,016 --> 00:52:56,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Good, because I saw that on the agenda items

806
00:52:58,218 --> 00:53:01,200
[SPEAKER_06]: He had one on April 14th.

807
00:53:02,321 --> 00:53:04,702
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, okay, so it sounds like you're way ahead of us.

808
00:53:04,763 --> 00:53:14,310
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as he's aware that we can't issue more than 31 day licenses for an entity, as long as, like I said, as long as he's aware of that, we'll be fine.

809
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:15,691
[SPEAKER_03]: He is aware of that, yeah.

810
00:53:16,111 --> 00:53:17,372
[SPEAKER_03]: He was actually on top of it.

811
00:53:19,033 --> 00:53:20,935
[SPEAKER_03]: whenever he started actually coming in front of us.

812
00:53:21,255 --> 00:53:23,156
[SPEAKER_03]: So he asked a great deal about it.

813
00:53:23,296 --> 00:53:32,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I remember at one point, I remember a few years, Springstep and Tufts were getting very close to, you know, the 30 mark.

814
00:53:32,343 --> 00:53:39,568
[SPEAKER_06]: So we, you know, that's when we started saying, hey, we should pay attention to this because, you know, you think, well, geez, 30, you know, that's a boatload.

815
00:53:39,628 --> 00:53:45,913
[SPEAKER_06]: But some of the establishments do get close to that number.

816
00:53:46,393 --> 00:53:46,653
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

817
00:53:47,114 --> 00:53:47,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

818
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:49,228
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm back.

819
00:53:49,829 --> 00:53:54,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby, anything new, or was he watching?

820
00:53:55,831 --> 00:53:56,872
[SPEAKER_05]: We got exciting news.

821
00:53:56,952 --> 00:53:58,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Attorney Farnsworth, I already got to him.

822
00:54:00,754 --> 00:54:06,837
[SPEAKER_05]: He says he just spoke with her, and he said that we don't need the pledge application.

823
00:54:06,877 --> 00:54:07,357
[SPEAKER_05]: She was right.

824
00:54:08,307 --> 00:54:09,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, okay.

825
00:54:09,107 --> 00:54:16,189
[SPEAKER_05]: And Ralph had said, um, he says, yeah, he says, I didn't know that it was a new license, which I did tell him it was a new license.

826
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:23,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but he said, I said, well, what about the entity vote where they have to, you know, vote on the, uh, on the pledge?

827
00:54:23,731 --> 00:54:30,332
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, no, that page March 1st, 2024, that's got pledged checked off.

828
00:54:30,572 --> 00:54:32,453
[SPEAKER_05]: So that covers the entity vote.

829
00:54:33,333 --> 00:54:36,934
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, he says, and all, they also have the, uh,

830
00:54:39,503 --> 00:54:47,205
[SPEAKER_05]: applicant statement that they vote on, which he says is in the main application, which it is.

831
00:54:48,065 --> 00:54:56,266
[SPEAKER_05]: And I asked him about the amendment pledge information sheet, which is the first one, and he said they didn't need it.

832
00:54:56,947 --> 00:54:59,107
[SPEAKER_05]: So he said, don't worry about the pledge.

833
00:54:59,287 --> 00:55:01,668
[SPEAKER_05]: I just touched base with him on all of the other things.

834
00:55:01,848 --> 00:55:05,028
[SPEAKER_05]: And he says, yeah, they've got to do all that other stuff, but the pledge, forget about it.

835
00:55:05,508 --> 00:55:05,728
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

836
00:55:06,028 --> 00:55:08,169
[SPEAKER_06]: So Bobby, help me understand this.

837
00:55:09,478 --> 00:55:13,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's a new license, it can be piggybacked.

838
00:55:13,824 --> 00:55:17,749
[SPEAKER_06]: But having an existing license and they were pledging, that would be different?

839
00:55:18,691 --> 00:55:18,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

840
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:26,491
[SPEAKER_05]: With the brand new license, it's in the brand new license application.

841
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:32,813
[SPEAKER_05]: On the first page, the monetary transmittal form, which has got all the boxes to check.

842
00:55:33,473 --> 00:55:33,933
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw that.

843
00:55:34,033 --> 00:55:35,253
[SPEAKER_05]: It says it's checked there.

844
00:55:35,473 --> 00:55:37,474
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, yes, I realized that.

845
00:55:38,054 --> 00:55:50,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Then the second thing that I had a question on was the application for amendment pledge of collateral, which is one of three sheets.

846
00:55:51,597 --> 00:56:01,359
[SPEAKER_05]: in the pledge, but it's got the same information in a new application than it does in an amendment.

847
00:56:01,939 --> 00:56:05,620
[SPEAKER_05]: And the applicant statement, that's filled out in the new application.

848
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:11,962
[SPEAKER_05]: And the entity vote, it's as long as pledge is checked off, you don't need to use this form.

849
00:56:13,873 --> 00:56:22,242
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, this is good because so I think I understand if it's a new application, then it's all can be piggyback.

850
00:56:22,302 --> 00:56:31,471
[SPEAKER_06]: But if it's an existing application and they're looking to pledge the licenses collateral, then that's a that's another application and another fee for ABCC.

851
00:56:31,871 --> 00:56:33,033
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's not correct.

852
00:56:33,373 --> 00:56:33,653
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

853
00:56:33,753 --> 00:56:34,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

854
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:36,656
[SPEAKER_05]: And the questions that I

855
00:56:37,537 --> 00:56:43,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of was wondering about too, but it makes sense today where he turned in the drawings with the patio.

856
00:56:44,141 --> 00:56:46,822
[SPEAKER_05]: We're approving the patio for outdoor dining.

857
00:56:46,922 --> 00:56:52,525
[SPEAKER_05]: I would imagine we don't have to do a separate thing for an alteration of premise or anything like that.

858
00:56:52,745 --> 00:56:53,626
[SPEAKER_05]: No, because that's all.

859
00:56:54,281 --> 00:56:54,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

860
00:56:55,102 --> 00:56:58,704
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what you guys did at the porch, you know, or the Ford.

861
00:56:58,784 --> 00:57:01,005
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't there when you approved all of that.

862
00:57:01,165 --> 00:57:02,186
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just all approved.

863
00:57:02,266 --> 00:57:03,687
[SPEAKER_07]: It is approved all up front.

864
00:57:04,047 --> 00:57:04,688
[SPEAKER_07]: All up front.

865
00:57:04,728 --> 00:57:06,048
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how we did it at the Ford.

866
00:57:06,449 --> 00:57:06,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

867
00:57:06,789 --> 00:57:07,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

868
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:08,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

869
00:57:09,564 --> 00:57:12,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I know where you're going with that.

870
00:57:12,627 --> 00:57:23,216
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like an existing license holder and then they want an alteration of footprint because they're going to push through into the back or to the side to add more seats.

871
00:57:23,656 --> 00:57:26,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Then that's an alteration of premises.

872
00:57:26,038 --> 00:57:26,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

873
00:57:27,139 --> 00:57:28,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but it's already in.

874
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:31,723
[SPEAKER_06]: In this, it's already in the original, correct?

875
00:57:32,477 --> 00:57:38,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I also asked Ralph, I says, before you hang up, any news on outdoor dining?

876
00:57:38,498 --> 00:57:40,179
[SPEAKER_05]: He says they still haven't decided.

877
00:57:40,219 --> 00:57:41,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

878
00:57:41,319 --> 00:57:48,920
[SPEAKER_05]: So nobody can have any outdoor dining that's was getting it through this whole COVID thing.

879
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:58,962
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, places like the Ford, places like the porch that already have it, you know, was part in Medford Brewing.

880
00:57:59,182 --> 00:58:00,803
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's licensed.

881
00:58:00,883 --> 00:58:02,163
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't need to worry about it.

882
00:58:02,883 --> 00:58:04,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they can so.

883
00:58:04,304 --> 00:58:09,566
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I just had something I had to just attend to something.

884
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:15,748
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if we're wrapping up or I can just for I need to be off for a 2nd, but if I'm not back on.

885
00:58:16,508 --> 00:58:16,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

886
00:58:17,408 --> 00:58:17,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

887
00:58:17,848 --> 00:58:19,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we are we concluding?

888
00:58:21,088 --> 00:58:26,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, do we have to vote on that 48 hour thing or no, it's it's the law or anyways, right?

889
00:58:26,351 --> 00:58:26,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

890
00:58:26,591 --> 00:58:27,132
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the law.

891
00:58:27,292 --> 00:58:27,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

892
00:58:27,832 --> 00:58:28,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

893
00:58:28,753 --> 00:58:30,874
[SPEAKER_05]: We're on Friday at 11.

894
00:58:30,994 --> 00:58:31,654
[SPEAKER_05]: We're good.

895
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:32,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

896
00:58:32,775 --> 00:58:32,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

897
00:58:33,115 --> 00:58:34,736
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to thank you.

898
00:58:34,996 --> 00:58:35,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Ben.

899
00:58:35,557 --> 00:58:36,377
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

900
00:58:36,397 --> 00:58:36,837
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

901
00:58:37,018 --> 00:58:37,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, everybody.

902
00:58:37,678 --> 00:58:38,538
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

903
00:58:38,699 --> 00:58:39,299
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

904
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:41,420
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

905
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:43,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for digging into that, Bobby.

906
00:58:45,217 --> 00:58:54,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Daria, she'll get that to us and it makes it a lot easier now because we don't have to review and digest that four-page pledge.

907
00:58:55,059 --> 00:58:57,880
[SPEAKER_06]: The other items are just, it's fill in the missing items.

908
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:06,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I just find it odd that it's not an interactive PDF where it just auto-populate from one area to the other, but she'll get it to us.

909
00:59:06,802 --> 00:59:10,342
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like she immediately picked up the phone and called ABCC.

910
00:59:11,003 --> 00:59:11,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

911
00:59:11,483 --> 00:59:12,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like she'll get it to us quickly.

912
00:59:14,185 --> 00:59:14,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, cool.

913
00:59:15,806 --> 00:59:23,430
[SPEAKER_03]: For outdoor dining, I just want to mention that we're still able to do outdoor dining, we're just not able to serve liquor.

914
00:59:24,975 --> 00:59:27,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, I believe so.

915
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:27,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

916
00:59:28,017 --> 00:59:30,758
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about outdoor dining, just the liquor we can't.

917
00:59:31,238 --> 00:59:31,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

918
00:59:31,538 --> 00:59:31,899
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

919
00:59:31,939 --> 00:59:32,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

920
00:59:32,299 --> 00:59:40,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Outdoor dining is all set because I know Planned Development and Sustainability work on that with KP law and the previous city solicitor that was here.

921
00:59:40,323 --> 00:59:41,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

922
00:59:41,884 --> 00:59:45,606
[SPEAKER_03]: We just can't serve liquor unless that emergency order gets approved.

923
00:59:45,846 --> 00:59:46,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Gets approved.

924
00:59:46,786 --> 00:59:47,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

925
00:59:47,286 --> 00:59:47,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

926
00:59:47,627 --> 00:59:48,987
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to clarify that.

927
00:59:49,087 --> 00:59:49,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

928
00:59:49,588 --> 00:59:49,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

929
00:59:49,788 --> 00:59:50,248
[SPEAKER_03]: No, thank you.

930
00:59:51,148 --> 00:59:51,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, good.

931
00:59:52,149 --> 00:59:52,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

932
00:59:53,470 --> 00:59:54,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, okay.

933
00:59:54,592 --> 00:59:57,675
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I said, we don't have to vote on the 48 hour thing, right?

934
00:59:57,695 --> 00:59:58,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's a wire anyway.

935
00:59:58,956 --> 01:00:00,898
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just we're gonna enforce it.

936
01:00:01,178 --> 01:00:03,421
[SPEAKER_05]: We we wanted to make sure that we, uh,

937
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:07,541
[SPEAKER_05]: In the area, I mean, if something comes up.

938
01:00:08,202 --> 01:00:19,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, the day before the meeting, and it's the city hall is having an event next week and we completely forgot all about it and oh, my God and blah, blah, blah.

939
01:00:20,088 --> 01:00:21,689
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, something like that's okay.

940
01:00:22,089 --> 01:00:32,133
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you actually read the 48 hour rule for Massachusetts, there are exceptions for emergency type of things like that.

941
01:00:32,773 --> 01:00:40,256
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, it's, it's, you know, if it's 1 of our regulars calling up with a sob story, then it's like, hey, listen.

942
01:00:41,456 --> 01:00:46,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, you can give him Jim's famous saying, this is your 1 bite of the apple after that.

943
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:48,178
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to happen anymore.

944
01:00:48,198 --> 01:00:53,500
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, just in a nice way, kind of like, hey, this is the rule.

945
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:57,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, we got to follow it because it's not everybody, especially Daria.

946
01:00:58,482 --> 01:00:59,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, right.

947
01:00:59,242 --> 01:01:02,024
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think, Daria, you'd be the one to make that call.

948
01:01:02,044 --> 01:01:06,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if you look at it, go, oh, boy, this is so complicated.

949
01:01:06,126 --> 01:01:09,008
[SPEAKER_06]: But if it's something you're, Bobby's right.

950
01:01:09,048 --> 01:01:15,391
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's something the city's going to do at the last minute, then we'd be more than happy to take a look at it.

951
01:01:16,912 --> 01:01:18,013
[SPEAKER_06]: But let's stick to the rule.

952
01:01:18,053 --> 01:01:18,813
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the rule.

953
01:01:19,774 --> 01:01:26,697
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's good to get all the patrons in a routine so they know what to expect and they know what the protocol is.

954
01:01:26,777 --> 01:01:27,678
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's smart.

955
01:01:29,466 --> 01:01:29,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

956
01:01:29,606 --> 01:01:31,207
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

957
01:01:31,667 --> 01:01:34,909
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's, uh, I guess, uh, make a motion to adjourn.

958
01:01:34,969 --> 01:01:37,731
[SPEAKER_06]: It's two Oh seven Bobby.

959
01:01:38,972 --> 01:01:41,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's, uh, let's, uh, a motion to adjourn.

960
01:01:42,394 --> 01:01:43,515
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll second the motion.

961
01:01:43,575 --> 01:01:44,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

962
01:01:44,095 --> 01:01:45,096
[SPEAKER_06]: All in favor.

963
01:01:45,356 --> 01:01:45,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

964
01:01:45,876 --> 01:01:46,416
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

965
01:01:46,817 --> 01:01:48,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Adjourned diarrhea.

966
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:49,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much, Bobby.

967
01:01:49,298 --> 01:01:49,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Good to see you.

968
01:01:50,699 --> 01:01:52,200
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

969
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:52,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care.

970
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:53,361
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye bye bye.
