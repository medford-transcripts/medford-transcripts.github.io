    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=0.251">Good</a>  afternoon, everyone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3.332">Bob</a>  and Ben, I just want to thank you for helping me out last month while I was in sunny Florida. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=8.072">So</a>  I couldn't make the meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=10.213">I</a>  just couldn't do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=11.913">Even</a>  by Zoom, I couldn't do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=13.353">So</a>  if everyone else will just indulge us, we need to do a little housekeeping first. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=19.894">We</a>  need to review the minutes of last month's meeting and just kind of give them the once over. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=29.456">I</a>  need a motion to approve them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=31.277">So</a>  I have looked at them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=34.059">There</a>  was only one item on it that I had a question on, and it's probably because. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=41.502">I</a>  wasn't here to hear the nuances of it, but I noticed that it's on the agenda again. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=47.023">It's</a>  about hearings information being submitted to Daria on the Friday before, so she's not under the gun putting things in the last minute. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=58.965">So</a>  I guess we can talk about that after we handle our two items on the agenda. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=68.447">Bobby,</a>  Ben, one of you, since I wasn't here, one of you want to make a motion to approve the minutes and we can get that off the table?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=78.074">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=78.354">Bob,</a>  do you want to? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=79.715">I've</a>  read it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=80.176">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=81.377">I'll</a>  make a motion to approve the minutes of the 20th License Commission meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=87.701">Everything</a>  looks fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=89.462">Make</a>  the motion to approve.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=91.023">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=91.464">Thank</a>  you, Bobby.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=93.948">Yeah,</a>  I read it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=94.628">I'll</a>  second it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=95.209">Ben,</a>  you want to second it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=96.409">Yeah,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=96.89">And</a>  also, Daria, thanks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=98.41">It's</a>  actually kind of a tedious one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=100.291">There's</a>  a lot of information there, all those dates. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=104.393">And</a>  thanks for doing that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=106.254">It</a>  looks good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=107.315">Very</a>  accurate.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=108.315">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=109.716">Daria,</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=110.916">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=111.997">Thank</a>  you for the second. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=113.157">Ben,</a>  all in favor of approving the minutes, say aye. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=117.52">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=118.9">Done.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=119.561">So</a>  we'll take that off the table. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=123.147">As</a>  I was saying, what I wanted to do when I was looking at the agenda, let me see here, I'm sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=134.615">I</a>  got them on my other screen. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=135.775">So</a>  we'll, we've taken, we've knocked off the minutes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=138.656">And</a>  then the second item says to discuss and vote on the deadline proposal brought forth by, let's shove that to the end. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=145.638">Let's</a>  take care of the two, you know, event them and 25 Salem Street LLC. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=152.78">Let's</a>  take care of that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=156.101">Brian,</a>  we're gonna start with you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=158.001">You</a>  always seem to have all your ducks in a row. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=160.122">I</a>  looked at the package. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=162.122">Again,</a>  we're very familiar with you and your events, your establishment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=169.086">You've</a>  been doing great since the day you opened. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=171.367">No</a>  incidents, no problems. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=173.948">Keep</a>  up the good work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=174.969">But</a>  tell us about what this event's all about, please.</p>

    <p>[Bryan MacAuslan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=179.651">So</a>  Myth, in 2023, we are hosting the Friends of Bedford Family Network here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=185.814">It'll</a>  be, I think, the third time that they've been here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=188.656">And</a>  essentially, it's <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=192.203">It's</a>  an opportunity for local families to get together and raising opportunities as well for that organization, which supports the family network here in the area. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=203.528">So</a>  yeah, we love having them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=206.849">People</a>  play games. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=208.41">They</a>  kind of hang out, do music. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=210.451">There's</a>  a lot of people involved, and also kids and family and adults. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=215.433">And</a>  the adults have a few benefits if it's available. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=221.571">offer</a>  to apply for the application for it.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=224.892">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=225.432">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=225.852">I</a>  see beer and wine, your estimated number of guests of 50, three to seven. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=232.995">I</a>  don't know if anything else, Bobby, Ben, anything in there that caught your eye? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=240.817">Brian's</a>  always been good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=241.878">He</a>  provides us with a diagram so we know where the beer and wine will be stored. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=250.705">I</a>  don't know, I don't have any questions.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=256.051">Everything</a>  looked fine to me, Mr. Chairman. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=259.794">Brian</a>  always does a great job. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=262.597">Nice</a>  diagram and layout. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=265.36">We</a>  know he's got insurance on file and never any issues there, so I don't have a problem with it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=271.927">Yeah,</a>  yeah, no.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=273.788">I</a>  agree. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=275.549">Is</a>  it open to the public or is it a private event?</p>

    <p>[Bryan MacAuslan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=279.732">It</a>  is, but they do sell some tickets in advance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=286.796">They</a>  don't want to necessarily turn people away, but they want to give people the opportunity to be able to lock in a spot.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=293.299">Yeah,</a>  cool, cool. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=295.451">Yeah,</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=297.112">No,</a>  just curious about how that worked. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=299.574">And</a>  no, everything looks good to me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=302.257">And</a>  so I would approve this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=306.32">We're</a>  good with this.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=445.048">Sure,</a>  Trish, I can take that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=446.89">Yeah,</a>  I was going to say, go ahead. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=449.512">Yeah,</a>  so it's roughly a 65 seater, I'm not sure exactly what it is, but it's circa that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=458.239">Restaurant,</a>  I would say, that has about, I think it's a 15 person bar. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=465.786">There</a>  is a little outdoor patio area at the back that we hope to get open at the same time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=476.584">It</a>  would be a traditional Irish bar, but as far as an Irish bar is in America, it's somewhat different in Ireland. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=484.688">And</a>  that's exactly where I am now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=485.889">And</a>  as Trish said, I'm doing some research. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=489.01">I</a>  want to make it as authentic as possible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=491.311">And</a>  I hope for an opening date circa August, I hope.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=499.856">August</a>  of this year, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=501.497">August</a>  of this year? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=502.297">Yes,</a>  sir. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=502.958">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=503.518">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=504.775">That</a>  would be great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=507.877">Yeah,</a>  that would be great.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=510.659">Yeah,</a>  I think, you know, when I looked at that site, I liked its visibility. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=517.323">I</a>  liked the size of it because I swore I wasn't going to do another big one and I won't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=523.427">On</a>  top of which, you know, I knew Tacuba and the owner managers of that property and I knew they were going to do something great beside me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=531.253">So</a>  I think <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=532.233">I</a>  think they'll be a good fit for each other. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=533.875">I</a>  know he's very much looking forward to it opening as well.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=537.185">Yeah,</a>  yeah, a little diversity in the square. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=540.606">It's</a>  all good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=541.587">I'm</a>  looking at the application. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=544.868">The</a>  356 square foot patio outside, I didn't even know there was an outside in the back there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=550.75">Nobody</a>  does. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=551.77">I've</a>  lived in Medford all my life. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=553.631">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=554.431">Bobby,</a>  did you know anything was in the middle there in the back? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=557.512">I</a>  had no clue.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=558.973">Yeah,</a>  I knew there was an alley there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=561.814">I</a>  think something might have came up with Takuba about, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=566.296">They</a>  wouldn't allow them to transport food between the two restaurants, that and the one on the Riverside Ave, you know? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=573.419">That</a>  makes sense. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=574.219">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=575.22">So</a>  I see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=575.84">I</a>  didn't think there was that much room though.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=577.901">I</a>  didn't either. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=578.481">I</a>  didn't either. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=579.442">And</a>  so two stories from what I see, seating capacity 85, is that still the number you're shooting for? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=586.365">Because</a>  I think you'd sell a little less or you would just, you know, just a small patio.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=592.182">Including</a>  the patio, 85 would be very close.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=595.705">I</a>  see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=597.686">But</a>  it's really just one story, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=599.448">And</a>  just the basement is the storage, right?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=603.03">And</a>  the prep kitchen downstairs, yes.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=605.532">Yeah,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=606.753">But</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=607.914">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=608.374">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=608.955">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=609.315">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=609.935">Yeah,</a>  I'm looking at the plans. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=615.68">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=617.22">The</a>  downstairs storage would have alcohol refrigeration or alcohol storage. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=624.666">That</a>  would be one of the rooms that are listed?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=628.449">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=628.609">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=629.089">Yeah,</a>  there's a walk-in refrigeration downstairs for that.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=632.67">Yeah,</a>  got it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=635.111">And</a>  just to remind my two fellow commissioners, not only is this an application for a license, a new license, but pledge of collateral, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=647.113">So</a>  it's also a pledge in there.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=649.093">Yeah,</a>  we do need to pledge where the whole build out, as you can imagine, is a significant investment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=656.375">And</a>  so Northern Bank and Trust have agreed to do that loan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=660.918">But</a>  obviously, the requirement is that the license is pledged to them.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=665.58">Oh,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=666.321">Being</a>  a banker for 42 years with 20 fines worth, I get it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=670.904">It</a>  makes sense. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=671.664">Yeah,</a>  it does make sense.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=673.245">Can</a>  I ask a question? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=674.366">So</a>  where is this in? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=675.946">You</a>  know, this is great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=677.307">It's</a>  very exciting, by the way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=678.648">I</a>  just think it's awesome. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=680.129">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=682.01">And</a>  does this mean the Ford has been a success for you? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=685.512">so</a>  far?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=686.612">Yes,</a>  the forge has gotten busier and busier as the longer it's there in truth and you know I had focused, I began to focus my attention on the Irish bar about nine months ago but we still had some work to do so I continued my focus on the forge and we're in a good place there and I feel that Medford Square in particular is ready for something new and something a little bit more, a little simpler so to speak and <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=715.459">Yeah,</a>  my attention won't be ever taken away from the board, that's to be very clear.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=720.643">Yeah,</a>  just more curious and I have to say, I don't look at it, but I'm actually really excited. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=730.049">I</a>  was really happy to see this come in because I'm a resident and I complain to my wife all the time, there's nothing to eat in the square. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=739.856">Or</a>  there's now like a couple of things and how it's to do to go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=744.119">Anyway,</a>  so I think it's great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=745.24">But</a>  all personal opinion aside. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=748.281">So</a>  is this is this as far as like a build a buildout? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=751.884">Is</a>  this submitted like, you know, for a building permit yet? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=756.407">Or</a>  is that is that sort of in the works? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=758.248">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=759.589">Yeah,</a>  it's already been granted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=761.73">In</a>  truth, they've started demolition. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=763.631">They</a>  started it about six months ago. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=766.773">They've</a>  done first fix on plumbing and electrics. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=770.758">and</a>  a few other bits and pieces, but until I get the funding released by the bank, I can't do any further work.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=779.282">Okay,</a>  but it's already in progress, so you just need your funds in place and this project can continue.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=788.065">Yeah,</a>  my contractor is ready to go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=789.926">Trish</a>  Farnsworth has done what she needs to do in relation to the ABCC. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=796.07">So,</a>  I mean, once the ABCC comes through, my builders will do what they're supposed to do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=802.291">And</a>  that's why when I say I'd hope to open it in August sometime, I think it's realistic.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=809.033">Nice.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=809.773">Nice.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=811.573">I'm</a>  scanning through, Bobby. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=812.793">You</a>  scan through the package. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=815.074">I</a>  see the note. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=816.594">I</a>  see Corey. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=817.614">I</a>  see passports. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=823.042">I</a>  don't see any.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=823.682">Sage</a>  is on the call too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=825.123">So</a>  she's going to be the manager.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=826.823">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=827.783">I</a>  do want to hear from Ms. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=830.024">McCoy</a>  also. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=831.464">We're</a>  just kind of going through the, I'm going through the package here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=835.545">I</a>  see a note with Northern Bank.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=839.786">Is</a>  she a minority owner? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=841.467">Is</a>  Sage one of them?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=844.348">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=845.128">Not</a>  yet.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=846.668">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=847.569">But</a>  there are a few, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=848.989">There</a>  are a few.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=854.483">I</a>  have some investors. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=857.024">So</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=858.065">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=858.745">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=859.446">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=859.826">It's</a>  okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=860.326">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=860.686">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=861.087">I</a>  see that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=861.667">I</a>  see the lease with Mr. Costa.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=871.172">I</a>  have some questions, Mr. Chairman. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=873.773">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=874.314">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=874.554">Go</a>  right ahead. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=875.514">I'm</a>  still scanning through the package.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=878.416">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=879.036">We're</a>  with, um, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=883.014">I</a>  spent some time on it and I had a few questions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=889.397">One</a>  of them being, well, you already spoke about the pledge. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=897.162">There's</a>  no pledge paperwork here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=900.323">There</a>  should be, let's see, application for amendment pledge of collateral.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=908.153">It's</a>  all in the application. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=910.035">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=911.215">It's</a>  question on the new license application, it's question I can tell you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=916.76">Question</a>  number nine on page four of the application, that's where it is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=922.524">And</a>  then you also check off pledge, I think on the monetary transmittal form. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=926.827">Yes,</a>  you do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=927.868">Pledge</a>  of collateral and new license.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=930.612">Yes,</a>  I saw you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=932.433">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=933.313">Yeah,</a>  I think I saw the pledge in the second. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=936.134">You</a>  know how the package was pretty large and Daria broke it into two packages? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=941.916">So</a>  I think that's in the second package, at least with mine.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=946.597">I</a>  didn't see any pledge paperwork at all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=950.076">I</a>  can see number nine, pledge information.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=955.621">Okay,</a>  yeah, there's a $711,000 promissory note and there's also a license pledge agreement, both Northern Bank.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=965.904">Right,</a>  I saw that as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=967.925">But</a>  the actual paperwork from the ABCC, it's four pages that you're supposed to apply for a pledge. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=976.43">And</a>  that's not filled out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=978.051">None</a>  of those four pages are with this application.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=981.493">Yeah,</a>  that's separate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=982.354">I</a>  think that's if you're just applying for a pledge separately.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=986.836">This</a>  is well, you can do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=990.939">But</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=992.352">You're</a>  going to it's going to cost you another 200 dollars. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=995.596">If</a>  you do it all on this application, it doesn't cost any more. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1000.102">You</a>  only pay 1 fee of 200 dollars. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1003.471">And</a>  the documents that I'm looking for is the monetary transmittal form, which is the cover page for the application for amendment pledge of collateral. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1012.877">Then</a>  there's a second page, which is also state application for amendment pledge of collateral. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1022.082">That's</a>  where you select either the pledge, the license, the stock or the inventory. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1027.785">Then</a>  you need to fill out an applicant statement again, which you already have when filled out with this new license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1037.328">You</a>  will also have to have an entity vote, which has the following transactions need to be checked off. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1044.93">Pledge</a>  of license, pledge of insurance, pledge of inventory rather, and pledge of stock. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1050.952">None</a>  of those documents are attached to this.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1053.985">Yeah,</a>  because they're all part of the application for new license commissioner that amendment application that's amending an existing license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1064.052">So,</a>  if I was if I was going in now separately for for an amendment of an existing, but there's no existing license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1070.856">So,</a>  this is all encompassed in the 1 license new license application and you check off. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1078.181">you</a>  know, that question nine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1079.861">And</a>  if you look at the vote, I have it checked off both new license and pledge. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1085.443">The</a>  monetary transmittal form has both checked off.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1090.944">That</a>  has both checked off. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1092.344">And</a>  I did see the, the bank paperwork. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1095.345">Um,</a>  I saw language in the bank paperwork for the pledge as well, but the, there's, there's two important documents and actually she's got them right here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1107.245">This</a>  is 1.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1109.067">Yeah,</a>  I know, but that's the amendment application. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1111.569">The</a>  amendment application. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1112.81">Yeah,</a>  the state, but we already have an applicant statement is an entity vote.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1117.994">I</a>  don't know if you want to look at that, but it also specific for pledge. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1123.099">It's</a>  not the same as the entity vote in a new application.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1127.623">Well.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1129.133">Yeah,</a>  no, the entity vote.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1132.435">I</a>  respectfully disagree with you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1134.657">Um,</a>  attorney funds with, because the only reason why is I spoke with, um, Ralph, uh, from these, the ABCC director, Mr. Sacramonio, and he said that you need this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1148.807">I</a>  spoke with him yesterday because I wasn't sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1152.109">And</a>  he says this package has got to be in with the new application package.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1157.52">Okay,</a>  we're happy to put that together. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1160.288">I</a>  can have Barry sign it right away.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1162.453">Yeah,</a>  that's got to be done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1164.719">Definitely</a>  got to be done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1166.598">Because</a>  we can't pass it with the pledge checked off unless the pledge paperwork is in it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1172.783">And</a>  I know what you're saying, application for amendment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1176.125">That</a>  was my question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1177.706">And</a>  that's why I spoke with Ralph about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1179.808">And</a>  he says, no, you have to have that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1181.949">He</a>  says, you can do it separate, but it's going to cost another $200. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1185.172">He</a>  says, this way, it's just $200. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1188.114">And</a>  they can check off as many boxes as they want on the monetary transmission form. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1193.918">And</a>  it's just that one $200 fee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1197.294">So,</a>  you know, that's something that needs to get done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1204.378">The</a>  only reason being is the ABCC, as soon as they see it come through without that, they're gonna kick it back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1210.302">And</a>  they just did kick it back with, who was it, Daria, we just got one kicked back because the pledge amendment wasn't on there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1221.688">I</a>  forget which one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1226.704">So,</a>  yeah, well, that that had some that had some other issues going on too.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1235.992">No,</a>  I mean, I have the, I can get, you know, I have that application paperwork. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1240.555">We</a>  can submit that right away to Daria.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1244.318">Yeah,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1246.495">That</a>  that you need to do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1247.617">I</a>  mean, it's just a matter of filling up a couple of times. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1249.96">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1250.821">Then</a>  why don't we do that to save you? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1255.428">Because</a>  not only that is we'd have to have another quick hearing for to vote on the pledge.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1260.937">Right,</a>  and it was no, the public notice clearly everything said was in there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1265.621">So,</a>  I mean, we're covered.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1267.783">Okay,</a>  well, there's a few more questions I had to go ahead. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1272.547">Go</a>  ahead. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1272.967">I</a>  just don't want to move forward on them until we know now we can make a condition upon seeing the paperwork for the plants, but continue on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1282.415">Go</a>  ahead. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1284.716">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1290.747">Collateral,</a>  okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1296.488">I</a>  highlighted everything on it so it'd be a little easier to find. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1300.829">I</a>  see all the notifications are done, the ad is done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1315.852">Application</a>  for a new license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1319.098">Number</a>  two, on the page one of the application for a new license, the DBA, I noticed you had it on the drawings, but there's nothing in the box here.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1334.65">I</a>  wasn't, yeah, I don't know if we were 100% sure on the DBA name. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1340.254">Barry,</a>  you weren't sure yet, right, on the name?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1344.27">I</a>  wasn't, I am now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1345.932">I'm</a>  free to release that, and it's going to be called Mrs. Murphys.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1352.717">MRS</a>  Murphys?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1354.639">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1355.459">H-Y</a>  apostrophe S. I can send Daria a new page one of that application that will have the DBA inserted.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1365.367">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1368.781">Then</a>  you'll get the four pages for the pledge. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1372.704">Good.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1375.647">Then</a>  as we go down a little further, let's see, page 2. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1392.16">On</a>  page 2, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1397.224">Let's</a>  see, hang on a second. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1404.189">Mr.</a>  Aquino, Doro Aquino?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1408.013">Yes,</a>  I know, yep.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1410.274">This</a>  is on the number six, Postal Office of Stock and Ownership and Interest. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1416.039">There's</a>  no social security numbers, no date of birth. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1419.382">Same</a>  for Barry Rafferty. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1421.404">Is</a>  there any reason why?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1424.163">Um,</a>  yeah, I had the day the 1st, so maybe that for some reason that isn't on your copy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1429.405">There</a>  are no social security numbers though. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1431.966">I</a>  believe. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1433.887">Those</a>  have to be filled in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1437.389">Yeah,</a>  well, if there's no Barry doesn't have there, you don't have a social security number. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1441.91">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1443.351">No,</a>  I do.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1443.831">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1444.211">Oh,</a>  you do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1444.972">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1445.982">Yeah,</a>  just look at these queries. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1447.783">Do</a>  I have them on the other folks? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1449.143">I</a>  have.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1449.864">Yeah,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1451.664">Yeah,</a>  I have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1452.304">Caitlin,</a>  Frederick, you have data breadth, social security.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1455.706">Yep,</a>  I have them on everyone.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1457.206">So</a>  we can. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1459.267">No,</a>  so you're missing Daro as well as Musio. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1464.129">Martin.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1465.049">Yeah,</a>  I have them on their query forms though. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1467.39">So</a>  I don't know why it's missing on that page too, but I can fill all of this in.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1474.357">And</a>  so those are.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1475.657">Dataverse</a>  and social security numbers. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1477.498">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1477.858">Thank</a>  you for that.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1478.958">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1479.359">That</a>  was not.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1483.06">Yeah,</a>  you don't want ABCC to see that and kick it out because of that.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1487.781">OK,</a>  another thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1491.362">Barry,</a>  well, Barry, through the chair, is the Ford the only other license in the state of Massachusetts that you are affiliated with in any way?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1502.726">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1505.297">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1507.119">On</a>  page 3, number 7, occupancy of premise. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1514.664">You</a>  see John Costas is the landlord. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1517.086">It's</a>  a lease. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1520.689">The</a>  landlord's phone number is blank. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1523.611">Landlord</a>  email is blank. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1526.013">Landlord</a>  address is blank. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1528.977">You</a>  know, God forbid there's a fire there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1530.778">We</a>  can't get a hold of Barry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1532.119">We</a>  got to call the landlord, whatever. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1535.021">I</a>  don't know what reasons they'd need it for, but the boxes are there and they're all blank. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1540.144">Could</a>  they be filled in?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1542.425">I</a>  can get that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1543.206">Barry,</a>  do you have his contact info? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1545.087">I</a>  don't see it in the lease.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1548.129">I</a>  do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1548.769">I</a>  don't have his address, but I'll text him. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1550.51">I'll</a>  get us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1551.051">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1551.391">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1551.811">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1553.492">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1553.933">So</a>  that's landline.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1555.353">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1563.92">Then</a>  we go to page 4, financial disclosure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1570.662">We</a>  go to source of cash contribution. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1579.646">Other</a>  officers, stock or ownership interests are not listed in name of contributor in the amount that they're contributing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1589.237">You</a>  have three or four investors listed here that are supposed to be there with the amount they're contributing along with pictures of their accounts or where the money's coming from. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1600.244">None</a>  of that's listed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1601.445">We</a>  never received any bank statements or anything as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1607.149">We</a>  do have Northern Bank and Trust for $711 for the term. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1613.353">But</a>  there's no other, the other financial interest parties are not even listed.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1620.33">I</a>  guess Attorney Farnsworth, are there other parties with a financial interest in the new restaurant?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1631.653">Well,</a>  Barry has these other folks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1634.353">It's</a>  the Molloy's.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1639.015">I'll</a>  just jump in there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1640.635">The</a>  Molloy's are the only investors. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1642.255">The</a>  two Aquino brothers are my contractors and they want to work with me going forward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1649.962">and</a>  there is no financial contribution from them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1652.044">So</a>  the financial contribution was from the Malloy, Caitlin and Ricky Malloy for 250,000. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1661.373">And</a>  I don't know what paperwork.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1665.598">So</a>  we should, we should, you should disclose that on the application and provide supporting documents for ABCC.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1673.818">Yeah,</a>  Barry will need to show with the 2250,000 a copy of the check or deposit or, you know, from the financials.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1684.029">Fine,</a>  fine.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1686.311">And</a>  my suggestion, I don't know if the other commissioners would agree. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1693.93">but</a>  the two Aquino's that are five percent of ownership, according to page 2 of proposed offices stock or ownership interest, the five percent each, whatever that, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1710.048">dollar</a>  volume is, it should be located or documented under financial disclosures with their name and what the amount of contracting bothering or how much contracting worth they're giving to the establishment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1733.457">I</a>  mean, you're making them a 5% partner because of doing the contracting work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1738.86">I</a>  think there should be a number in there somewhere. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1741.582">And</a>  even if you say a partner for contracting X number of dollars worth of work, I don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1747.646">I</a>  don't know how that would work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1748.766">I'm</a>  not a lawyer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1750.227">That's</a>  attorney Farnsworth. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1751.788">But</a>  yeah, I don't know.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1753.389">Yeah,</a>  we could just say that they're, you know, sweat equity partners. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1758.352">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1758.972">Because</a>  I don't want to confuse the ABCC because that's really source of cash <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1763.415">cash</a>  contribution because they're always just trying to track the money.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1768.719">Yeah,</a>  you can wordsmith that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1770.1">You're</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1770.8">Sweat</a>  equity or builders equity, something like that.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1774.463">Yeah,</a>  something's got to be in there because they are listed as ownership interest.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1780.567">Oh,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1781.428">We</a>  were disclosing them because they are in fact owners.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1798.102">It</a>  seems to be a lot there, Bobby. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1800.042">Good</a>  catch.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1802.023">I</a>  still got more, Mr. Chairman.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1804.143">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1806.263">With</a>  what we've seen now, I would surmise that they would kick this back to you and then you go back and forth and you come back to us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1814.645">But</a>  go ahead, Bobby. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1816.625">You</a>  have some more items that caught your attention?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1820.586">Yeah,</a>  I did actually. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1823.146">Next</a>  was the pledge, but we already discussed that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1828.416">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1844.049">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1844.969">I</a>  got on the entity vote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1854.085">It's</a>  page 18 of the PDF1.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1857.667">Yeah,</a>  I have that.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1866.691">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1869.872">Okay,</a>  entity vote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1873.133">At</a>  the very top, the third line down, I think you're meant to put in March 1st instead of March 1st.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1880.529">Oh,</a>  yeah, yeah, okay, we can fix that.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1883.95">Small</a>  error, nothing big. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1886.411">Voted</a>  to a point, you left it blank.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1889.051">Yeah,</a>  saves needs to be put in there.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1891.872">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1893.453">I</a>  mean, there's an awful lot of blank things and, you know, I was going to make a motion just to table this till next month because a lot of it's not even here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1901.575">I</a>  mean, especially the pledge. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1905.376">The</a>  pledge is a big deal. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1908.879">And</a>  I can't vote to put it through without this thing being completed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1914.283">It's</a>  not completed the way it should be. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1918.187">Yeah,</a>  I don't know about you other fellows. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1920.969">I</a>  mean, believe me, I just want to see it do it right so you don't have any issues. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1926.937">I</a>  don't want to see you have any issues. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1928.417">I</a>  don't want to come back to us from the ABCC. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1931.098">Why</a>  didn't you pick up this? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1931.918">Why</a>  didn't you pick up that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1934.579">A</a>  lot of these things, it's just minor, but it's got to be done.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1939.44">I</a>  want to see this project continue moving forward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1946.221">But</a>  you're right, there's quite a few omissions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1948.961">I</a>  think Attorney Farnsworth has been taking notes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1952.042">I</a>  see her hands up.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1953.102">Oh,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1953.802">We</a>  can turn this around today.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1956.423">Well,</a>  that's kind of what I was hoping you'd say. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1959.625">I'm</a>  thinking that if the other two commissioners are agreeable, that let Attorney Farnsworth rework the package, get it to Daria. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1970.411">Daria,</a>  if you don't mind, send it to the three of us, and we can kind of review it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1975.694">We</a>  could put something in the notes that we've looked at it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1978.836">We've</a>  seen some omissions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1980.197">They're</a>  going to get addressed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1982.078">and</a>  we'll revisit it as soon as possible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1986.2">That</a>  way we don't have to delay this another month. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1990.041">Daria,</a>  what do you think? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1993.502">That's</a>  fine with me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1994.743">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1995.763">It's</a>  fine with you guys. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1996.683">I'm</a>  fine with whatever.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1998.444">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=1998.704">Yeah,</a>  I'm good with that as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2000.385">I</a>  mean, these are all points, you know, Commissioner Delfano is bringing up and, you know, he also went to the trouble of talking to the ABCC kind of like, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2010.578">for,</a>  you know, on behalf of you, in a way, to make sure that, like, it was gonna go through and, you know, and it looks like it would have been kicked back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2018.521">So</a>  I do think he saved you a step in bringing all these things up, too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2024.403">But</a>  I think it is, you know, if it can be turned around quickly and back to us while everything is still fresh in our, you know, memory, I think it's reasonable. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2033.567">Because</a>  I would like to see it proceed as well, you know, assuming all these boxes get checked. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2038.168">So</a>  that's how I feel about it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2040.458">Yeah,</a>  and I really don't want to tie it up for another month as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2043.642">I</a>  like the forward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2046.245">I</a>  dine in there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2047.086">I</a>  patronize the place and it's a great place. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2050.831">And</a>  I think this place in Medford square is going to be just as good with the management and everything that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2058.58">You</a>  know, everything about it, it seems to work, but that's why I just want to make sure we've got it all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2064.242">I,</a>  you know, I started T's cross to just just get it done in 1 thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2069.965">But,</a>  um, yeah, attorney found where they like, like the chairman and the other commissioners stated is as long as it's all corrected, you get it back to Gary or she can email it to us individually. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2084.071">Unfortunately,</a>  we can't me, um, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2087.93">together</a>  or converse together versus emails. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2092.271">So</a>  if any of us has any issues, we have to just go back and forth one-on-one to Darrier and then until it gets resolved. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2104.034">I</a>  mean, in the meeting, it's great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2105.314">We</a>  can all talk openly like this, but outside the meeting, as you know, we can't.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2110.915">So</a>  if we do find anything odd or strange, we'll go through Daria. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2117.322">Daria</a>  will reach out to you, Attorney Farnsworth, and that's kind of how it would work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2121.205">Hopefully,</a>  you'll make sure everything is— Oh, yeah.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2124.749">I'm</a>  going to go through it now with a fine-tooth comb. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2127.572">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2128.292">Good.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2129.291">Good,</a>  good, good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2130.412">Okay,</a>  so let's- Mr. Chairman, I just want to let you know that I can, and Daria and Ben, on this page, on this PDF1, I kind of highlighted everything and I'll send a copy to Daria and she can send it out to you guys. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2148.342">So</a>  when we get the new paperwork, it'll be easy for you just to reference what we're looking for and make sure it was taken care of.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2156.719">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2158.64">That's</a>  a great idea. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2159.601">I</a>  think you should definitely do that, because Bobby's very thorough, so I'm sure that'll point to everything that needs to be updated, and hopefully we don't have to do all that email circle, because that's always tough. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2169.828">Yeah,</a>  yeah, it's a pain. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2172.209">Okay,</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2175.591">I</a>  beg your pardon. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2176.792">Can</a>  I just have one thing to say, if that's okay? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2179.094">So,</a>  first of all, I serve beer for a living, and unfortunately, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2185.032">few</a>  clerical errors that are there, you know, to Tricia's word, she said she'll have it all back to Daria today. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2191.178">If</a>  there's any concerns in relation to my work or what we're doing, I'd love to know now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2197.464">I</a>  hope there's not. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2199.386">But</a>  I do feel sure that whatever information that was requested there would be provided within the next two hours.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2207.841">Yeah,</a>  no, that's fine with me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2211.583">I</a>  don't have any issues with the, I mean, Alan, the financing stuff is your forte, banking stuff rather. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2218.407">I</a>  mean, that's not my forte. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2220.248">Ben,</a>  the building stuff, that's your forte. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2226.532">I'm</a>  just a retired old guy that's got nothing better to do than read this thing and try and pull it apart, but, you know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2233.696">I'm</a>  grateful.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2234.912">No,</a>  I am too, because I, you know, I do these applications. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2238.694">I</a>  don't know why some of these things missing, but the pledge separate paperwork is news to me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2243.816">So,</a>  but that's fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2245.517">I'll,</a>  you know, we'll do that.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2248.458">If</a>  you want to do any funds with, I can, I can send a link to Daria with the paperwork I'm talking about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2257.242">I</a>  have it I do have the pledge amendment application okay it's just four pages you know it's it's that's all that's required with it and yeah that's that's basically about it I mean I don't think it's anything it'll be resolved by the time we finish our meeting we we got a few minutes at the end of this then a couple of matters that we have to go over with the <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2282.098">uh,</a>  posting of, uh, of, of, uh, the deadlines and stuff for the 48 hour ramp, the 48 hour rule. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2289.085">So,</a>  you know, I don't think you're going to get your stuff that quick, but just send it to Daria and we'll review it and get it back to you or back to Daria as soon as ASAP.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2303.059">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2303.88">Makes</a>  sense. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2307.564">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2307.784">McCoy,</a>  we'd like to hear from you a little background. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2312.468">Tell</a>  us a little history if you're still there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2316.973">Yes,</a>  I'm here.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001231_SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2320.977">So</a>  background about myself or? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2323.099">Yeah,</a>  a little about yourself, your experience in the industry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2327.288">Yes,</a>  so I've been working with Barry at the Ford since before it opened. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2332.033">Previous</a>  to that, I was running River Bar in Somerville, but been taking hold of the Ford, getting it, you know, operational and functioning and profitable. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2341.262">So</a>  is always the goal. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2342.703">So</a>  I'll be doing the same for the pub when that opens, hopefully in August.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2348.936">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2350.817">Like</a>  I said, we just wanted to get you on record some of your information. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2355.54">I</a>  thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2360.482">We</a>  can make a motion to table 25 Salem Street LLC until the package with all the tweaks are taken care of and then we can review it again.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2377.464">okay</a>  i mean i guess because do you have to vote though mr chair because if you don't vote the three of you now right i i don't know how you guys work but do i just don't want to have to wait a whole nother month i mean i guess it would be you would vote to approve pending you know receipt of the proper documentation or something i guess uh i don't know um that's what i thought</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2403.536">Oh,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2404.677">Yeah,</a>  well, that's I was saying, you know, we could we could approve this conditionally condition on.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2409.683">Yeah,</a>  that was my understanding of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2412.247">Sorry</a>  for me speak. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2413.108">That</a>  was just my understanding of it to that if. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2416.827">Very</a>  valid points, very good catch on all of this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2419.849">But</a>  if our hang up is on the paperwork and paperwork does come through, and like Barry asked, if we don't have any other real concerns about granting the license because of him or because of Sage or anybody else, and then I think I would be OK with approving it conditional on that paperwork coming back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2441.597">But</a>  like we said, if it doesn't, for some reason it doesn't come back, there's too many questions, it could get tabled until the next month. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2448.419">I</a>  mean, for sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2449.539">So</a>  hopefully it doesn't.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2452.02">Bobby,</a>  your thoughts on that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2454.14">Are</a>  you okay with the conditional approval or no?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2457.241">No,</a>  I'm okay with the conditional approval. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2461.002">As</a>  long as, you know, I'm just like attorney Farnsworth says, how do we do this? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2468.424">Do</a>  we vote again? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2471.852">maybe</a>  individually to Daria versus email once we receive everything, review it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2480.054">Daria</a>  will forward us all those papers. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2483.654">I'll</a>  read it if I like it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2485.335">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2485.955">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2486.315">All</a>  is good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2487.195">I</a>  approve. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2488.015">I</a>  email it back to Daria. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2490.376">You</a>  do the same. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2491.756">Ben</a>  does the same. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2492.936">But</a>  is that legal with all of this open meeting law stuff? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2497.017">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2497.537">I</a>  don't know what the</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2502.341">I'm</a>  not sure either. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2504.262">I'm</a>  not sure either. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2505.262">But</a>  we've done that in the past, and we've never heard from KP law telling us that what we're doing is not <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2514.392">You</a>  know, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2515.253">So</a>  I don't have a problem with it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2517.556">Yeah,</a>  I say, you know, where, you know, where Zoom is, you know, is a brave new world. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2522.542">Let's</a>  continue doing it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2524.104">We</a>  have been doing it until K.P. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2526.447">Law</a>  or we finally get a city solicitor that tells us, no, stop doing it that way.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2533.96">Okay,</a>  I don't have an issue with it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2536.521">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2537.501">And</a>  basically, it's diarrhea can't turn this paperwork into the ABC anyways, unless all 3 of us approve via email. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2545.664">So</a>  correct. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2547.164">If</a>  it was conditionally approved, it's, it's basically, I don't see any issues with it.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2552.375">Okay,</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2553.576">Then</a>  one of the two of you make a motion to conditionally approve the new license application and the pledge, and then we'll go from there.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2565.745">Bobby,</a>  you or me?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2568.427">What's</a>  that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2569.207">You</a>  or me? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2570.454">Yeah,</a>  why don't you do it, Ben?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2571.815">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2572.136">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2573.197">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2573.537">So</a>  let me see if I can get this right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2574.939">So</a>  I'm going to make a motion to approve the application for the new license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2581.926">The</a>  entity name is 225 Salem Street LLC. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2584.448">The</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2590.232">The</a>  address is, sorry, not 225, 25, sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2595.534">The</a>  address, 25 Salem Street, Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2600.157">This</a>  is for a new license per the description and the plans that have been submitted on this application by Barry Rafferty. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2617.435">And</a>  this is going to be conditionally based on the completion, the proper completion of this package, which is going to include all of the. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2629.645">uh,</a>  the additional owners, uh, financial information we've requested from the additional owners, as well as some additional information we've requested with landlord information, um, and- and so on, as we've, uh, requested. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2644.131">Uh,</a>  so- so to summarize that, uh, we're gonna make a motion to approve this on the condition that we, uh, receive in a prompt amount of time, reasonable amount of time, um, all that additional follow-up information.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2658.936">And</a>  can we insert the pledge, the pledge four pages for the pledge?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2664.079">Yeah,</a>  sorry, as well as that four page pledge collateral, which is available on the ABCC.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2676.046">I</a>  think we could basically just say all of the things we discussed that needed to be, because there's six or seven things here.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2683.61">Yeah,</a>  correct, correct. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2685.011">So</a>  that's the motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2685.852">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2688.728">Yes,</a>  I'll second that motion.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2691.09">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2691.511">Jerry,</a>  did you get all that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2694.594">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2695.254">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2695.595">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2696.355">All</a>  in favor of accepting the motion, say aye. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2702.541">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2703.122">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2703.622">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2704.812">Okay,</a>  so, Attorney Farnsworth, you have a big homework assignment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2708.513">Yes,</a>  we have it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2710.153">And</a>  to get it back to us as quickly as possible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2713.054">And</a>  then, as Commissioner Delafarno said, we'll each look at it, and if we have any questions or concerns, we'll send them through Daria, and Daria will reach out to you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2724.357">Okay,</a>  perfect. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2726.818">Okay,</a>  very good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2728.579">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2729.039">All</a>  right, thank you, thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2730.619">Thank</a>  you all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2731.239">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2738.765">Sorry</a>  about that, everybody.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2740.085">No,</a>  no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2740.866">Those</a>  are good catches. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2746.107">If</a>  we didn't head that off now and ABCC got it, do you think ABCC would just kick it back to them with highlight or notes saying this is incomplete, take another crack at it?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2760.368">Yeah,</a>  they kick it back, you know, saying that, what do they call it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2765.753">No</a>  action. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2770.017">And</a>  that's only going to delay it a lot longer.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2773.64">Yeah,</a>  because they will have to come back to us.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2776.423">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2777.644">I</a>  thank you for your eagle eyes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2781.227">You</a>  caught a lot of things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2784.209">It</a>  is interesting that some things on the application auto-populate and some don't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2789.533">I</a>  mean, like why would some of the social securities and data birds carry over from the other sections, but some of them don't? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2796.598">I</a>  just, I don't know.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2799.2">I</a>  think she just forgot to put them in the application. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2802.042">I</a>  mean, they were on the quipping. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2804.423">And</a>  all she needed to do is just log them in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2808.906">And</a>  that's what a lot of this stuff was. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2812.629">I</a>  mean, the date of the, I forgot to tell them too, on the entity vote, the date of the meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2818.813">Maybe,</a>  Darry, you can make a note on that, the entity vote on page, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2827.197">18,</a>  what was that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2829.38">18,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2830.362">Third</a>  line down, it says come.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2831.904">Yeah,</a>  voted to appoint.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2833.567">Yeah,</a>  the date of their meeting.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2834.829">Oh,</a>  yeah, yeah, what it says on March, March, start of March.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2840.352">Notch</a>  for us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2841.573">I</a>  did bring that up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2842.393">It</a>  was Notch. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2843.414">Yeah,</a>  you did say that.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2847.356">That</a>  form, is that an interactive PDF? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2852.479">Or</a>  is it a dummy thing where you just print it down and then you enter the information in there? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2858.503">Jerry,</a>  do you know if that's interactive on ABCC?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2864.306">Some</a>  yes and some are no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2866.167">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2868.548">Because</a>  the one that I'm looking at, a Pledge of Collateral, you can definitely. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2874.45">It's</a>  interactive. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2875.411">You</a>  can just open it up and type right into it.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2878.012">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2878.752">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2879.772">But</a>  I know some are not. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2881.253">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2881.853">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2882.693">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2883.854">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2884.894">This</a>  was good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2885.475">This</a>  was a good exercise. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2887.815">I</a>  hope Attorney Farnsworth completes it and gets it back to us as quickly as possible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2895.186">Bobby,</a>  I wanted to come back to that item on the agenda. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2900.387">I</a>  wasn't quite following the spirit of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2904.228">I</a>  know we had talked about it some time back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2907.008">Is</a>  it more so that people aren't just dropping things off at the last second, like Monday at 2 o'clock and they're dropping something off for the Tuesday hearing? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2918.791">Is</a>  that the spirit of that whole item?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2926.351">Hang</a>  on one second, Al. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2927.412">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2940.304">I'm</a>  sorry, Mr. Chairman, I know you had to answer something. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2943.307">Oh,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2945.329">Yeah,</a>  basically what's happening is it seems like every month that <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2952.74">That</a>  we're having a meeting the morning of the meeting, we're getting 2, 3 applications for 1 day licenses and, um, you know, not only is it against the 48 hour meeting open meeting law. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2967.567">Um,</a>  you know, all that has to be in 48 hours before the meeting takes place, excluding weekends and holidays. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2974.989">So</a>  poor Daria's getting hammered left and right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2977.929">Then</a>  she's sending them out to us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2979.83">We're</a>  trying to read them, uh, 10 minutes before the meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2985.491">And</a>  it seemed to be the same people kind of doing it all the time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2990.112">So</a>  we, we, we left it as a, uh, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2994.256">I</a>  got Ralph. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2994.957">I</a>  got Ralph Sacramone calling me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=2996.938">Do</a>  you want me to take it?</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3001.762">Just</a>  mute everything. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3004.464">Daria,</a>  do you like this idea? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3007.006">Do</a>  you think this would help you be more efficient with the hearings? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3012.69">If</a>  we said, look, it's got to be Friday before the Tuesday? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3015.592">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3018.745">I</a>  think Friday would be ideal by like 11 a.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3022.668">So</a>  this way, because I want to get it to you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3024.889">I</a>  want to have the agenda sent to you guys plus the documents because I know it's a lot sometimes and I don't want to send it to you on Tuesday or Monday. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3033.055">I</a>  want to have it ready for Friday like I did this Friday. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3036.517">Sometimes</a>  when I get things last minute, it prevents me from sending it all at the same time because I'm getting it all at different times. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3044.735">So</a>  it's better off have a deadline, which is Friday, let's say 11am. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3049.317">So</a>  it gives me till 1230 to scan everything in and to get it to you guys before the end of the day here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3056.159">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3056.98">So</a>  then you have the weekend and then yeah, I know I like I like that idea because sometimes Monday's a holiday.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3063.882">Yeah,</a>  like this Monday was a holiday. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3065.503">So</a>  I didn't, you know, if I come back on Tuesday, I get bombarded with, I mean, this Tuesday didn't happen, but a couple of Tuesdays I'll be getting everything. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3074.708">And</a>  it's like, I'm trying to catch up from my work plus places. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3078.47">And</a>  I don't wanna, I don't think it's fair for me to send you guys last minute items either.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3082.492">Yeah,</a>  no, no, I like the idea. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3085.273">I</a>  only wish I thought of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3086.913">So</a>  I say that's fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3091.674">Let's</a>  use that as long as we all are on the same page so nobody's calling us on a Monday or a Tuesday morning saying, oh, I forgot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3101.436">And</a>  the event's going to be before the next meeting, your next licensed meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3109.338">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3110.278">We'll</a>  stick with that protocol and we'll do our best to get the repeat offenders in a routine so they know not to pull any last minute items. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3122.606">Hey,</a>  Dara, I haven't been tracking this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3126.188">I</a>  know it's only April, but event them, Brian seems to be, his business, his entity keeps <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3135.313">growing</a>  and involving and he has so many different events do we do we track because it's my understanding we will only issue up to 31 day licenses for any entity do we do we keep track of event them</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3150.212">He</a>  knows per calendar year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3151.692">Him</a>  and I are actually going to talk tomorrow. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3153.973">We're</a>  supposed to talk beginning of the year, but then he got sick and then it got all delayed because sometimes it's under him. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3161.394">Sometimes</a>  it's under JJ Cuisine.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3165.015">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3165.235">So</a>  I want to explain to him how that works plus non-profit and profit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3169.636">So</a>  he's clear on that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3171.656">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3171.916">So</a>  we're going to talk about it tomorrow.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3174.016">Good,</a>  because I saw that on the agenda items <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3178.218">He</a>  had one on April 14th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3182.321">So</a>  yeah, okay, so it sounds like you're way ahead of us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3184.763">As</a>  long as he's aware that we can't issue more than 31 day licenses for an entity, as long as, like I said, as long as he's aware of that, we'll be fine.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3194.35">He</a>  is aware of that, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3196.111">He</a>  was actually on top of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3199.033">whenever</a>  he started actually coming in front of us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3201.255">So</a>  he asked a great deal about it.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3203.296">Because</a>  I remember at one point, I remember a few years, Springstep and Tufts were getting very close to, you know, the 30 mark. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3212.343">So</a>  we, you know, that's when we started saying, hey, we should pay attention to this because, you know, you think, well, geez, 30, you know, that's a boatload. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3219.628">But</a>  some of the establishments do get close to that number. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3226.393">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3227.114">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3228.808">I'm</a>  back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3229.829">Bobby,</a>  anything new, or was he watching?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3235.831">We</a>  got exciting news. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3236.952">Attorney</a>  Farnsworth, I already got to him. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3240.754">He</a>  says he just spoke with her, and he said that we don't need the pledge application. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3246.877">She</a>  was right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3248.307">Ah,</a>  okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3249.107">And</a>  Ralph had said, um, he says, yeah, he says, I didn't know that it was a new license, which I did tell him it was a new license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3257.129">Um,</a>  but he said, I said, well, what about the entity vote where they have to, you know, vote on the, uh, on the pledge? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3263.731">He</a>  says, no, that page March 1st, 2024, that's got pledged checked off. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3270.572">So</a>  that covers the entity vote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3273.333">And,</a>  um, he says, and all, they also have the, uh, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3279.503">applicant</a>  statement that they vote on, which he says is in the main application, which it is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3288.065">And</a>  I asked him about the amendment pledge information sheet, which is the first one, and he said they didn't need it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3296.947">So</a>  he said, don't worry about the pledge. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3299.287">I</a>  just touched base with him on all of the other things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3301.848">And</a>  he says, yeah, they've got to do all that other stuff, but the pledge, forget about it.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3305.508">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3306.028">So</a>  Bobby, help me understand this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3309.478">Because</a>  it's a new license, it can be piggybacked. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3313.824">But</a>  having an existing license and they were pledging, that would be different?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3318.691">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3322.49">With</a>  the brand new license, it's in the brand new license application. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3328.692">On</a>  the first page, the monetary transmittal form, which has got all the boxes to check. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3333.473">I</a>  saw that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3334.033">It</a>  says it's checked there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3335.473">I</a>  said, yes, I realized that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3338.054">Then</a>  the second thing that I had a question on was the application for amendment pledge of collateral, which is one of three sheets. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3351.597">in</a>  the pledge, but it's got the same information in a new application than it does in an amendment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3361.939">And</a>  the applicant statement, that's filled out in the new application. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3366.16">And</a>  the entity vote, it's as long as pledge is checked off, you don't need to use this form.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3373.873">All</a>  right, this is good because so I think I understand if it's a new application, then it's all can be piggyback. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3382.302">But</a>  if it's an existing application and they're looking to pledge the licenses collateral, then that's a that's another application and another fee for ABCC. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3391.871">So</a>  that's not correct.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3393.373">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3393.753">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3394.474">And</a>  the questions that I <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3397.537">Kind</a>  of was wondering about too, but it makes sense today where he turned in the drawings with the patio. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3404.141">We're</a>  approving the patio for outdoor dining. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3406.922">I</a>  would imagine we don't have to do a separate thing for an alteration of premise or anything like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3412.745">No,</a>  because that's all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3414.281">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3415.102">I</a>  don't know what you guys did at the porch, you know, or the Ford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3418.784">I</a>  wasn't there when you approved all of that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3421.165">It's</a>  just all approved.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3422.266">It</a>  is approved all up front. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3424.047">All</a>  up front.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3424.728">That's</a>  how we did it at the Ford.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3426.449">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3426.789">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3428.09">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3429.564">Again,</a>  I know where you're going with that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3432.627">It's</a>  like an existing license holder and then they want an alteration of footprint because they're going to push through into the back or to the side to add more seats. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3443.656">Then</a>  that's an alteration of premises. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3446.038">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3484.304">You</a>  know, I just had something I had to just attend to something. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3489.586">I</a>  don't know if we're wrapping up or I can just for I need to be off for a 2nd, but if I'm not back on.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3496.508">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3497.408">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3497.848">Are</a>  we are we concluding? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3501.088">Yeah,</a>  do we have to vote on that 48 hour thing or no, it's it's the law or anyways, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3506.351">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3506.591">It's</a>  the law. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3507.292">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3507.832">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3508.753">We're</a>  on Friday at 11. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3510.994">We're</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3512.075">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3512.775">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3513.115">I</a>  just want to thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3514.996">Thank</a>  you, Ben. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3515.557">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3516.397">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3517.018">Thank</a>  you, everybody. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3517.678">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3518.699">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3520.82">I</a>  know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3521.48">Thanks</a>  for digging into that, Bobby. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3525.217">Daria,</a>  she'll get that to us and it makes it a lot easier now because we don't have to review and digest that four-page pledge. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3535.059">The</a>  other items are just, it's fill in the missing items. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3537.94">Again,</a>  I just find it odd that it's not an interactive PDF where it just auto-populate from one area to the other, but she'll get it to us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3546.802">It</a>  sounds like she immediately picked up the phone and called ABCC. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3551.003">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3551.483">Sounds</a>  like she'll get it to us quickly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3554.185">Okay,</a>  cool.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3555.806">For</a>  outdoor dining, I just want to mention that we're still able to do outdoor dining, we're just not able to serve liquor.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3564.975">Oh,</a>  yeah, I believe so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3567.196">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3568.017">I</a>  don't know about outdoor dining, just the liquor we can't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3571.238">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3571.538">No,</a>  no, no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3571.939">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3572.299">Outdoor</a>  dining is all set because I know Planned Development and Sustainability work on that with KP law and the previous city solicitor that was here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3580.323">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3581.884">We</a>  just can't serve liquor unless that emergency order gets approved. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3585.846">Gets</a>  approved. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3586.786">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3587.286">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3587.627">So</a>  I just wanted to clarify that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3589.087">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3589.588">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3589.788">No,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3591.148">Okay,</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3592.149">Good.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3593.47">Um,</a>  okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3594.592">And</a>  like I said, we don't have to vote on the 48 hour thing, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3597.695">Because</a>  it's a wire anyway. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3598.956">So</a>  it's just we're gonna enforce it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3601.178">We</a>  we wanted to make sure that we, uh, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3605.34">In</a>  the area, I mean, if something comes up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3608.202">Like,</a>  the day before the meeting, and it's the city hall is having an event next week and we completely forgot all about it and oh, my God and blah, blah, blah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3620.088">I</a>  mean, something like that's okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3622.089">And</a>  if you actually read the 48 hour rule for Massachusetts, there are exceptions for emergency type of things like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3632.773">So,</a>  I mean, it's, it's, you know, if it's 1 of our regulars calling up with a sob story, then it's like, hey, listen. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3641.456">Uh,</a>  you can give him Jim's famous saying, this is your 1 bite of the apple after that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3646.798">It's</a>  not going to happen anymore. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3648.198">So,</a>  you know, just in a nice way, kind of like, hey, this is the rule. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3653.8">Well,</a>  you know, we got to follow it because it's not everybody, especially Daria.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3658.482">Right,</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3659.242">And</a>  I think, Daria, you'd be the one to make that call. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3662.044">Because</a>  if you look at it, go, oh, boy, this is so complicated. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3666.126">But</a>  if it's something you're, Bobby's right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3669.048">If</a>  it's something the city's going to do at the last minute, then we'd be more than happy to take a look at it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3676.912">But</a>  let's stick to the rule. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3678.053">I</a>  like the rule. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3679.774">I</a>  think it's good to get all the patrons in a routine so they know what to expect and they know what the protocol is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3686.777">So</a>  I think it's smart. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3689.466">Cool.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3689.606">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3691.667">So</a>  let's, uh, I guess, uh, make a motion to adjourn. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3694.969">It's</a>  two Oh seven Bobby. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3698.972">Let's,</a>  uh, let's, uh, a motion to adjourn. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3702.394">I'll</a>  second the motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3703.575">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3704.095">All</a>  in favor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3705.356">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3705.876">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3706.817">Adjourned</a>  diarrhea. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3708.037">Thank</a>  you very much, Bobby. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3709.298">Good</a>  to see you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3710.699">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-17-24&start=3712.24">Take</a>  care.</p>
