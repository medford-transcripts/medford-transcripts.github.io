    <p>[May Marquebreuck]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=111.758s">Yes,</a>  May Markeybrook, 16 Glenwood Ave., Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=116.4s">Good</a>  evening, President Dello Russo and members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=121.903s">Tonight</a>  I'm here representing the committee who is organizing the 75th anniversary of the celebration, and the celebration of the Shroudier Theatre. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=136.126s">Members</a>  of the committee are Tom Kozachek, Ken Kraus, John Kostas, and Cindy Watson, and out of town at the moment is Susan Fairchild. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=151.055s">First</a>  of all, I wish to extend our condolences to Joe Grandi and his family on the recent passing of Geraldine Grandi. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=162.178s">Jerry</a>  served as chairperson of the Shrouded Commission for 35 years and loved the theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=170.68s">In</a>  this time, she worked tirelessly to rehabilitate the building, to bring it to the present first class, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=180.212s">theater</a>  that it is today. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=184.055s">We'll</a>  be thinking about Jerry on Saturday when we celebrate the 75th anniversary of the dedication of the Method High School Auditorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=193.022s">On</a>  March 7, 1940, city officials and citizens came together to name the auditorium in memory of Lieutenant Commander Godfrey Chevalier, who, remember, was a pioneer in naval aviation. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=210.758s">and</a>  a war hero from Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=213.76s">One</a>  of his most important accomplishments was when he was the first aviator to land a plane on a moving ship. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=223.686s">About</a>  a month after that event, unfortunately, Godfrey Chevalier was in an accident, a plane crash in Virginia, which resulted in his death at age 33. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=239.898s">That</a>  was in 1922. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=240.898s">We're</a>  proud of Godfrey Chevalier and of the history of the Chevalier Theatre. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=247.78s">It</a>  has played an important role in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=252.341s">For</a>  30 years, high school graduates walked across its stage to receive their diplomas. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=259.563s">I</a>  can still remember my graduation. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=262.824s">The</a>  auditorium was also a host to many civic events, pageants, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=267.61s">and</a>  especially wonderful stage performances by the Medford-based Mystic Players. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=274.612s">When</a>  the high school was relocated to Winthrop Street in 1970, the history and condition of the building changed dramatically. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=282.855s">It</a>  was vacant, ignored, and fell into major disrepair. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=293.199s">It</a>  was not until 1980 when the city of Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=297.27s">the</a>  property owners of the building, upon receiving a $1.2 million grant from the State, established a Civic Auditorium and Convention Center Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=309.639s">Under</a>  the direction of this group of volunteers, major improvements such as an elevator, new lobby and restrooms, and a stair tower and stage right were made <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=328.718s">in</a>  compliance with ADA regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=335.96s">Additional</a>  funds from the Friends of Chevalier and Gene McJim, the City of Medford, have contributed to the rehabilitation, along with major funds secured by Representative Paul Donato, to replace the original wooden seats with comfortable cushion seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=353.624s">The</a>  Chevalier Theatre is now a first-class performing arts center <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=357.43s">for</a>  the community to enjoy. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=361.113s">For</a>  this 75th anniversary of Chevalier, several groups have collaborated in organizing and presenting a tribute to the theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=370.58s">The</a>  Friends of Chevalier Auditorium and Gene McJim, City of Medford, the Chevalier Theatre Organ Society, and the Chevalier Auditorium Commission, and the Canadian American Club of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=387.719s">On</a>  this Saturday evening, a special concert will be presented at Chevalier to celebrate the history and survival of this important landmark in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=401.25s">It</a>  will feature the music and magic of the Baron MacNeil Ensemble, Canada's Celtic ambassadors. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=409.696s">Their</a>  performances include superb expertise of many instruments, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=415.058s">beautiful</a>  singing in harmony, and step dancing. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=420.123s">This</a>  talented musical family has been on tour extensively in Canada and on the international circuit. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=428.211s">There</a>  will also be local talent in the concert, when students of the Jackie O'Reilly School of Dance will perform step dancing with Barbara McNeils. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=440.981s">The</a>  doors will open for patrons at 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=445.204s">to</a>  enjoy concessions with cash bars serving the famous Medford rum and South Boston Irish whiskey by our major sponsor, Grand 10 Distilling. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=459.934s">Wine,</a>  beer, and non-alcoholic beverages will also be available until showtime at 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=467.59s">This</a>  celebration could not happen without the generous support of the community, especially our sponsors, Grand Tent Distilling, Remax Realty Services, Members Plus Credit Union, Wynn Resorts Everett, Prioto Lane & Associates, and the Medford Arts Council, and all the businesses, groups, and individuals that purchased advertisements in the program book. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=498.994s">We're</a>  most grateful to everyone who has made this event possible, especially to all the volunteers. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=507.039s">I</a>  invite the community to join in this celebration by coming to the concert. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=512.583s">Tickets</a>  can be purchased online at www.chevaliertheatre.com or at Medford Electronics, 25 Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=526.473s">Tickets</a>  are reasonably priced at $26 and $19 for students and seniors over 60. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=535.778s">If</a>  you're planning to dine out before the show, local restaurants are offering discounts when you show your theater ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=545.624s">That</a>  will be at Carol's Restaurant, Snappy Patty, Ninja All-You-Can-Eat Sushi, and Salvatore's Restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=555.843s">This</a>  will be a great evening of entertainment, so we hope you will join in this one-time milestone for this great asset here in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=569.409s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Krause]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=580.293s">Thank</a>  you, May. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=580.773s">If</a>  I could, Ken Krause, 50 Mystic Street, also a member of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=585.026s">I'll</a>  be brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=585.827s">Um,</a>  I was researching an article about the 40th, uh, the 75th anniversary of the, and, uh, the dedication and actually researching the actual dedication ceremony. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=595.634s">And</a>  in my research, I was reading the Medford high school yearbook of 1940. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=599.717s">And,</a>  um, I was struck by a paragraph that was written by the three members of the senior class, um, about the year, uh, actually their career at Medford high. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=612.086s">And,</a>  um, in particular, the, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=615.413s">opening</a>  of the new auditorium and gym. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=617.295s">And</a>  I'd just like to read you that real quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=620.637s">It</a>  says, if you have ever moved into a new home shining and bright, you will understand our elation as we learn that the latest addition to our school is ready for occupancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=632.706s">Of</a>  course, there are the usual classrooms, but the selections of the building which draw our attention are the completely equipped gymnasium and the magnificent auditorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=645.972s">How</a>  proud we are to be the first class to hold our commencement exercises in that hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=653.679s">I</a>  have often wondered if the citizens of Medford realize how appreciative we are of their efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=665.23s">At</a>  any rate, we feel sure that the sacrifice has not been made in vain. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=671.621s">as</a>  testified by the goodly number of students with high scholastic standing." <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=678.564s">I</a>  was just really moved by how profound that sentiment was by three 17 or 18-year-old students who wrote that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=687.287s">And</a>  I think it just made me mindful of how appreciative we need to remain to be <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=694.324s">of</a>  those people 75 years ago that got this auditorium built and also of the citizens 35 years ago that made sure that it was preserved as an auditorium when it was this close to being converted into condos. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=710.096s">So</a>  I just wanted to share that and encourage people to come to the theater if you've never been there or if it's been a long time since you've been there. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=720.102s">And</a>  I'm sure you'll enjoy the concert, and I'm sure you'll come away with an appreciation for this gem of a facility that we have in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=728.77s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=729.991s">Thank</a>  you, Ken.</p>

    <p>[Cindy Watson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=732.134s">I'd</a>  just like to add one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=734.256s">Cindy</a>  Watson, 65 Valley Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=737.619s">And</a>  I'm going to speak from the heart. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=738.98s">As</a>  Ken said, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=741.343s">Chevalier</a>  is a hidden gem. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=743.105s">We've</a>  been to this podium a long time now. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=745.787s">It's</a>  a 75-year anniversary. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=748.348s">And</a>  if people don't get it, there's something wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=752.191s">It's</a>  the sixth largest theater in New England. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=755.073s">It's</a>  huge for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=756.995s">We</a>  generate a lot of revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=759.316s">And</a>  one of the things, too, that we really... We've been working on this since November. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=763.899s">One</a>  of the things we thought it might be a nice prelude to St. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=767.542s">Patrick's</a>  Day for <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=769.149s">Obviously,</a>  I'm Irish, but for those, you know, everybody celebrates St. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=772.471s">Patrick's</a>  Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=773.632s">So</a>  please come. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=774.873s">The</a>  tickets are reasonably priced. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=777.795s">We</a>  want people to be there, and people have worked diligently. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=782.238s">So</a>  particularly the city councilors, we're asking you to really market this event. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=787.902s">We're</a>  on the countdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=789.723s">Saturday</a>  is around the corner, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=792.345s">So</a>  if we can't dazzle you with our brilliance, we'll baffle you with our blarney, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=798.349s">Come.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=799.385s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=801.746s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=804.888s">Yes,</a>  briefly, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=806.328s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=868.023s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=869.184s">And</a>  on the motion of Councilor Marks that this paper be received and placed on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=874.205s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=875.105s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=876.205s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=876.985s">15-087</a>  petition for common vigilance license by <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=885.16s">Angelo</a>  Federico, president for Associazione Amici, Incorporated, 21 Reardon Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=892.082s">Sir,</a>  your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=894.183s">Good</a>  evening, Mr. President, members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=896.304s">John</a>  Guarnara, 130 South Street, Medford, representing the petitioner, Association Amici, Incorporated. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=902.486s">By</a>  way of background, ladies and gentlemen, the organization is a very small cultural and social club, which is a nonprofit. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=911.889s">Its</a>  club facilities are located at 21 Reardon Road, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=915.387s">Redden</a>  Road, I found out after they contacted me, runs off Mystic Avenue between the Portland Group, which is a plumbing supply house, and the Nissan car group. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=929.817s">So</a>  you've probably gone by it a million times and never realized it was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=933.319s">It's</a>  located in an industrial area on an unaccepted street. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=938.223s">There</a>  are two or three businesses in there currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=941.725s">The</a>  organization inhabits a boat. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=945.671s">1,200</a>  to 1,300 square feet, which was a build-out for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=949.053s">As</a>  I indicated, they are very small in size, less than 100 members. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=954.115s">Their</a>  primary function, actually, from what I understand, is that's a dining club. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=958.897s">And</a>  once a month, the members will get together, a group will cook, and they'll enjoy an evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=963.759s">And</a>  that basically comprises the extent of their social activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=969.061s">At</a>  some point, we will be seeking a liquor license. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=971.603s">And</a>  at that time, I'll come back before you to extend the hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=975.243s">beyond</a>  that of a common patrol's license. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=977.965s">I</a>  have three members of the board of directors and officers with me this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=982.107s">If</a>  you have any questions, I'll be more than happy to answer them for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=985.589s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=986.45s">Councilor</a>  Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=987.53s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=988.911s">Just</a>  before I make a few comments and just in the interest of full disclosure, not only the attorney representing the clients this evening is a friend, but also my former employer for about two and a half months, about four years ago in 2010. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1004.838s">November</a>  to roughly January of 2015 in the interest of full disclosure. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1010.562s">And</a>  if I may, I think this is a real good organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1013.864s">It's</a>  going to add to the diversity of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1017.646s">The</a>  gentlemen that are on the board certainly have been very enthusiastic about this over the past few years leading up to this great endeavor. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1027.312s">And</a>  it's before us this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1029.774s">And</a>  this is something that I support wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1032.936s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1033.776s">Thank</a>  you, Consular.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1035.367s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello, Chairman of the Licensing. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1037.809s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1038.669s">Mr.</a>  President, I have reviewed the papers and I have found everything in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1043.332s">I've</a>  had the opportunity to speak with some of the members of the club. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1046.074s">I've</a>  gone down there and toured the club and they've expressed their intent to get involved in the community, but with maybe some scholarships and be a real community organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1057.721s">So</a>  I welcome them to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1060.483s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1061.544s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1062.965s">Councilor</a>  Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1064.247s">Two</a>  questions, John. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1065.068s">The</a>  first one is, you said there's about a hundred members?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1067.889s">About</a>  a hundred members? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1069.871s">There</a>  were 50 charter members, Councilor, and I believe now there are approximately 30 associate members, but well under a hundred. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1077.856s">And</a>  you're going to have this get together once a month for this dinner or whatever it might be? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1081.798s">Their</a>  main function will be a meeting and a dinner meeting once a month.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1086.081s">The</a>  question I would have, where are they going to park their cars? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1088.702s">Where</a>  are they going to park their cars? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1090.323s">Are</a>  they going to infringe upon the neighborhood?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1094.225s">On</a>  a Friday evening, the road is such that there'd be a very adequate space to park cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1102.93s">There</a>  is one business in the area that is a dance studio that fronts on the parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1109.634s">There</a>  is a metal fabrication business that's open regular normal business hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1116.739s">And</a>  at the other end, there is an electrical contractor who holds business hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1122.528s">The</a>  road itself, which I indicated is non-accepted, provides a very vast area for parking at non-business hours, which would be typically the hours that members would be at this particular organization.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1134.976s">And</a>  is this a reintroduction of the old Italian club that used to be on Up and South? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1138.438s">Pardon</a>  me? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1138.918s">Is</a>  this a reintroduction of the Italian club that used to be up on South Method? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1143.401s">No,</a>  not at all.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1144.902s">It's</a>  quite separate and distinct. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1146.082s">Councilor?</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1149.625s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1152.566s">Lungo-Koehn</a>  on the motion of approval by Councilor Caraviello, Councilor Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1156.768s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1158.149s">If</a>  you can enlighten us, what else is involved in the membership? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1162.511s">I'm</a>  sorry, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1163.292s">What</a>  else is involved in the membership? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1165.273s">Why</a>  are they a non-for-profit?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1169.515s">They</a>  receive non-profit status from the Internal Revenue Service after filing as a non-profit with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1178.896s">And</a>  as you well know, Councilor, filing your article of organization with the internal revenue after about a 10-month period of time, if they deem you qualified, they will give you a non-profit status. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1191.466s">Nobody</a>  has a pecuniary interest in the club. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1194.709s">There</a>  is no profit to be made by any one individual in the club. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1199.193s">Any</a>  monies that are generated will be used for charitable purposes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1205.498s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1208.165s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1208.585s">If</a>  that is all Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1209.985s">And</a>  one last thing, John, uh, on your page that you have coming back from the department of revenue and the letter of compliance, I'm sorry, on the letter that came back from the department of revenue that was submitted, the indicate you have no withholding, no sales and no room occupancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1225.789s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1225.949s">You</a>  have, you have the, you have the, uh, copy from the IRS and revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1231.73s">I</a>  filed it with my papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1232.991s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1233.551s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1233.691s">But</a>  in that pipe that you filed, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1235.658s">you're</a>  not being responsible for withholding sales in room and room.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1239.52s">There</a>  are no employees.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1240.301s">But</a>  what are you going to do if, in fact, in the future you said you folks are going to be applying possibly for a liquor license? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1246.405s">Now,</a>  somebody has to pay for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1248.706s">So</a>  are the members going to pay for that?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1250.628s">Well,</a>  as I indicated, 500 members put up $500 was put up by 50 charter members to generate a flow of cash.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1267.09s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1267.931s">If</a>  you were to get a liquor license from the City and your members go there for an event, are they going to charge for the alcohol that they are going to be serving? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1276.097s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1276.618s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1277.058s">Then</a>  you would have to come back and reapply for a sales tax provision as far as that part goes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1283.183s">From</a>  what I understand, a nonprofit pays a tax once a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1289.768s">I</a>  know from other nonprofits that I have been involved <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1292.105s">So</a>  they would pay once a year, but that would be up to their accounting. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1296.086s">I</a>  would never presume to give accounting or tax advice to a client. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1301.168s">I'm</a>  not qualified. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1302.188s">But</a>  it's my understanding that on the sale of alcohol, even in a nonprofit, they are required to pay a very small portion to the Commonwealth once a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1313.731s">If,</a>  in fact, there were a hall rental, and this facility is not of the size to be rented, they would be required to pay it once a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1322.852s">Okay,</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1324.653s">Thank</a>  you, if that's all, Councilor Matz? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1327.355s">Yes,</a>  John, is the red, is that accessible by public safety vehicles?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1334.419s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1335.58s">Yes,</a>  it is, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1336.681s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1337.241s">And</a>  I think the, I know we filed with both, as you're well aware, we filed with both the fire chief and with the police chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1348.308s">And</a>  I believe they both signed off favorably on a petition.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1352.498s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1353.318s">And</a>  the, uh, the original charter, uh, where, where was the original location for this club?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1360.201s">This,</a>  this is, this is the original. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1363.163s">So</a>  this is, this is the original. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1364.683s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1365.404s">The,</a>  the articles of organization were filed, I believe in, uh, March of, uh, 2014, uh, with the, um, uh, Commonwealth of Massachusetts secretary of state corporations. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1377.569s">It</a>  was a new group of people who got together and, uh, they filed a new corporation. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1382.517s">And</a>  they got their response back from the Internal Revenue Service, I believe in October of 2014, giving them non-profit status. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1392.222s">So</a>  this is a group, an original group in and of itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1396.145s">It's</a>  not a successor group of any other.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1397.926s">Okay,</a>  the reason why I ask, and I'm not sure if Councilor Penta was referring to that, is next to the old water and sewer building, the Italian American Club was there, as you probably are aware. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1411.547s">for</a>  many years until it burned down. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1414.148s">And,</a>  um, many of the organization members were trying to relocate back in the city here because their original charter was a method charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1424.31s">And,</a>  um, I'm not sure if this organization, uh, if you have any affiliations with anyone from the Italian American club, but, um, I know there was a great interest to come back into the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1438.054s">So</a>  I don't know if maybe at some point, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1440.633s">There</a>  could be some discussions.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1442.354s">Well,</a>  I'm sure, Councilor, if some of those members contacted the association or the club, they're more than happy to discuss that with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1450.836s">They</a>  say the quarters are not very large, and there are under 100 members currently, but I'm sure they'd be amenable to talking to anybody interested in joining. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1462.44s">I</a>  wish them well. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1463.04s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1463.961s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1516.159s">I</a>  started this group after I began researching what kinds of addiction resources and education Medford has to offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1521.96s">To</a>  my disappointment, I found very little. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1524.162s">There</a>  is nothing posted on the city's website about substance abuse or who to call if you have any questions or concerns regarding this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1530.708s">The</a>  site doesn't mention anything about Families Anonymous, a support group that has met weekly in Medford for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1538.092s">This</a>  is important information for the public to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1544.037s">This</a>  information should be easily accessible for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1547.059s">To</a>  be honest, I wasn't entirely shocked by this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1549.181s">I</a>  feel like when it comes to substance abuse, everything tends to be swept under the rug. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1552.824s">It's</a>  easier to ignore than to deal with the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1555.546s">After</a>  researching, I decided I wanted some answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1557.888s">I</a>  sent a couple of emails to the mayor and then also to the same emails to the secretaries in his office. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1563.332s">I</a>  did get a response from Lisa Evangelista, who was very helpful and forwarded my email to Penny from Team Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1568.815s">That</a>  is when I had my first meeting with Penny. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1571.017s">I</a>  told her all of my concerns and what I would like to do in Medford to help raise awareness, educate the masses, and break the stigma. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1578.742s">Our</a>  first event was a community meeting where over 30 people from Medford and the surrounding cities came to share their stories <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1584.256s">and</a>  to find out what they can do to address the issue in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1588.298s">Many</a>  people in Medford have been affected by this disease, including myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1592.219s">It's</a>  everywhere, and it does not discriminate against age, gender, race, or income. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1599.022s">No</a>  one is exempt. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1604.144s">Whether</a>  people choose to believe it or not, Medford does have a drug issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1608.506s">It's</a>  time that it is brought into light, and we do something about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1611.867s">The</a>  entire community, city officials, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1614.168s">law</a>  enforcement and its members must work together on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1617.891s">We</a>  can do better. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1619.132s">We</a>  feel the first step in this battle is to heal those wounded hearts amongst us who've lost loved ones to addiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1624.917s">We</a>  must say to them, your loved one mattered to this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1627.499s">So</a>  I'm here today to invite you to a truly community-oriented candlelight vigil being held by Medford Overcoming Addiction in partnership with Team Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1636.145s">The</a>  vigil will be held on Sunday, March 22nd from 5 to 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1639.989s">right</a>  here in these very chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1642.07s">We've</a>  been working very hard planning this event. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1644.471s">Prior</a>  to the vigil, we will be holding a nasal Narcan training and presentation for anyone in need of this life-saving drug. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1652.833s">The</a>  vigil program will include, most importantly, the names of those lost to this disease of addiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1657.794s">We</a>  will also have some Medford residents that are living in long-term recovery share their stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1662.175s">Local</a>  resident and recovery-based poet Matthew Ganim will be sharing one of his hope-inspiring poems. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1667.556s">Families</a>  Anonymous will have two families from their group speaking as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1671.442s">Many</a>  people from the community have volunteered their time to help with this event, and we would like it if you could all attend the vigil in support of our community group, the Fight Against Addiction, and of those families who have lost a loved one to this disease. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1685.765s">With</a>  me here is Medford resident John Garrity. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1688.666s">John</a>  and his family have been tremendously affected by this disease. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1692.068s">This</a>  is a very difficult time for the Garrity family, for Thursday marks the one-year anniversary of the death of their son, Jay, who lost his life to this disease at the young age of 30. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1700.651s">I</a>  would like to take the time and express our condolences to John and the Garrity family. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1707.094s">John</a>  would also like to say a few brief words.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1893.061s">Does</a>  anybody know? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1895.043s">Because</a>  you haven't been told and you look callous. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1899.386s">What</a>  you need to know is that I've lost my son. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1905.096s">These</a>  people have lost people and we all vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1908.997s">We</a>  all know what's going on and we know what's not going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1912.698s">So</a>  it does have an impact on you eventually. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1915.778s">And</a>  believe me when I say this, I don't blame any of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1918.519s">I</a>  know that you don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1920.119s">It's</a>  a blind spot in the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1923.04s">It's</a>  a blind spot with the police. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1924.62s">It's</a>  a blind spot with the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1926.361s">It's</a>  a blind spot with you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1928.509s">But</a>  there are a lot of dead people in Medford from this one drug. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1936.133s">And</a>  I'm going to say to you that these are not, although heroin and drug abuse affects crime, it affects public health, it affects all of these things, what you don't realize today is that this is, there are functioning <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1957.493s">heroin</a>  addicts. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1958.313s">This</a>  is a drug now that people function every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1962.815s">One</a>  of you could be a heroin addict, and the other people wouldn't know it, not for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1969.477s">And</a>  this is a disease, I guess, that I take great umbrage with the word addiction, because that's used politically as a way to say your fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1985.671s">and</a>  it's really not that way, and it's done that way whether it's gambling or anything that they want to put on the individual. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1992.173s">These</a>  are not addicts, they are dependent. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1995.654s">People</a>  will say to you, I had a man say to me, I bought some balloons for my son's event, and he said to me, well, you know, he made a choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2006.197s">Well,</a>  let me tell you, the choice that you make with heroin is the first one, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2012.479s">Because</a>  what this drug does <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2015.713s">is</a>  it hijacks the part of your brain that you use to eat. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2029.702s">How</a>  long do you think you could go without eating? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2032.083s">It's</a>  not a just say, no, that's an addict. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2035.205s">He</a>  should stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2036.105s">He</a>  made choices. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2037.566s">And</a>  recently, I'm going to tell you about the word choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2040.987s">Recently,</a>  I walk my dog in the woods every day and there's a lot of community in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2045.772s">And</a>  recently I've heard things like when a police officer gets shot or the Ferguson situation comes up, people saying, well, that guy's not a hero. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2057.683s">He</a>  made a choice to be a police officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2060.866s">So</a>  that's his job. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2062.067s">Tough</a>  luck for him. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2063.689s">That's</a>  what happens when you start saying, well, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2066.567s">He</a>  made a choice or she made a choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2068.909s">Be</a>  very, very careful of the word choice because then we start to put it on everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2074.853s">And</a>  as far as addiction as a word, if you look up the definition of addiction, and I don't mean this to be fresh or funny, but Mr. Penter could be an addict for politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2091.025s">He's</a>  been doing this a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2092.366s">He</a>  keeps going back no matter how much he suffers. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2095.485s">And</a>  others could be. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2098.527s">But</a>  my point is that there needs to be a mechanism and a liaison, maybe another committee, where you are kept up to date and monitored how many deaths are happening from these drugs. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2114.216s">Because</a>  what you have is an epidemic, or what you have had is an epidemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2119.199s">And</a>  I could make the argument, pretty convincingly, that <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2124.195s">They're</a>  not victims of heroin. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2126.215s">They're</a>  victims of manslaughter at best, and at worst, premeditated murder, because these drugs are mixed with something that's going to kill them that they have no control over in a premeditated way. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2140.838s">So</a>  what happens in Europe and Canada is they offer injections to addicts or dependent <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2154.55s">drug</a>  users, and they come into a clinic and they get an injection of the heroin or whatever they were, you know, they use different types of morphine. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2164.538s">But</a>  the point is it becomes controlled. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2168.001s">So</a>  when you have an epidemic and you have bodies in the streets that you don't know about, and you have devastated families in your own community while you guys sit here and, you know, look at issues about water, sewers, and these kinds of things, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2182.706s">There</a>  has to be a mechanism to say, OK, we've got an epidemic, and we need to set up a way to get these addicts to stop buying street heroin. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2195.693s">And</a>  whether you use that mechanism or some other, most of the remedies that are out there now have not worked. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2203.317s">But</a>  because you guys don't know, you simply don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2207.7s">I</a>  mean, how do you feel?

<a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2897.648s">People</a>  are using just to numb their feelings. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2900.649s">And</a>  that's why, in recovery, they say, if you're an alcoholic, don't pick up the marijuana, or pick up this, or do that, or do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2906.593s">Or</a>  if you're an intravenous drug user and you stop doing that, don't pick up the Budweiser, because you're just substituting your problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2916.398s">These</a>  are the things no one wants to talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2918.739s">But</a>  I got nine, 10 months left on this city council before I retire. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2922.605s">And</a>  this is something that I'm going to follow through on and make it my mission to have the city step up, have the city put funding behind this, not just press conferences, but actual places that families and substance abuse users can go to when they're ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2937.902s">Because</a>  no one's kidding anyone, until you are ready, until you are ready and surrender, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2944.823s">You</a>  can have anything in front of you, and all these families out here can relate, anything at all in front of you, and you're gonna choose the booze, the heroin, the pills, whatever it may be, you're gonna choose that, because ultimately it takes control of your life, takes control of your life. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2962.793s">And</a>  I wouldn't have believed this until I confronted my disease, because it's awful easy to look outside and throw glasses and use the word junkie or a drunk, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2974.087s">I</a>  wrote my wife a nice letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2975.908s">You</a>  know what I always thought the alcoholic was, the drunk? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2978.35s">The</a>  guy at Harvard Square sitting there with a brown paper bag, with a brown paper bag, drinking and collecting cans to go and buy the next bottle of booze. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2987.196s">I</a>  didn't think it was someone that was a city councilor for 16 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2990.378s">I</a>  didn't think it was someone that worked for the Sheriff's Department for 18 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2995.161s">You</a>  know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2996.622s">It</a>  doesn't discriminate. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2998.725s">does</a>  not discriminate. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=2999.685s">We</a>  have members of this community that are suffering so much that end up killing themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3004.747s">Killing</a>  themselves because they're in so much pain. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3007.788s">Pick</a>  up the obituaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3009.089s">Not</a>  everyone says alcoholism or drug abuse or this or that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3014.371s">But</a>  we know people that have committed suicide and were struggling with this very disease. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3018.292s">And</a>  they took that route rather than letting everyone else down. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3022.814s">Because</a>  when you're in a state <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3024.318s">and</a>  you feel like your disease got you by the grip, guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3030.583s">You'd</a>  rather be dead. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3032.465s">You'd</a>  rather be dead. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3033.766s">And</a>  I'm speaking from experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3035.908s">So</a>  we have to do something as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3040.012s">We</a>  have to actually get out there and fund some programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3043.855s">Because</a>  like I said, when the substance abuse users are ready, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3049.127s">We</a>  have to be there to meet them with open arms and give them guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3051.889s">Right</a>  now, the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous, the 12th step is giving back. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3056.251s">It's</a>  giving back. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3057.652s">I'm</a>  working with other people, other people that are alcoholics, to try to give them hope, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3067.158s">And</a>  I just hope, I just hope that the city administration takes a long look at this and look that since 2003, 2003, in this community, people were overdosing, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3078.84s">on</a>  heroin, overdosing. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3081.101s">A</a>  baseball player for the Florida Marlins overdosed within the seven and a half miles of this community several times, several times. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3089.266s">And</a>  that was in 2000, early 2000. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3091.007s">And</a>  here we are today. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3093.709s">So,</a>  uh, like I said, let's actually put our money where our mouths are and fund this something. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3102.534s">And</a>  I know councilor Dello Russo called me today cause he knows I've been on his back about calling a committee of the whole meeting on this particular matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3108.807s">And</a>  I don't know if you chose the date yet, but I thank you for being very active on this.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3115.292s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3122.898s">Councilor,</a>  thank you for sharing your experience, strength, and hope with us.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3216.665s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3220.307s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3221.467s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3224.545s">First</a>  of all, I'd like to thank the Garrity's and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3227.707s">Butler,</a>  and I'd like to let you know that you're going to make it through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3231.288s">And</a>  the reason you're going to make it through this is because you have people like Janelle Rocco, who are here to help you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3241.012s">And</a>  it's a reciprocal relationship. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3244.374s">Janelle,</a>  you're going to make it too, because you have people like the Garrity's and the Butler's that are here to help you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3249.996s">But</a>  I think that we as a city government need to take a look at the way that we are approaching <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3254.738s">addiction</a>  addiction recovery and <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3257.803s">The</a>  punitive approaches that we take, I don't think we're looking at this as a public health crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3263.608s">I</a>  think we're looking at it as a public safety crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3265.829s">And</a>  until we really change our focus and our efforts on treating addiction as a disease and not as a public safety issue, we're going to see a lot of the same problems repeat themselves over and over and over again, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3278.68s">I</a>  think that we've had a lot of discussion about addiction here in this council, and it's something that's very close to a number of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3286.263s">And</a>  one of the things I'd like to see is Medford Overcoming Addiction be invited to our Committee of the Whole meeting to provide us with some input and insight and maybe a little bit of direction as to what they see working in other communities and other places. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3302.038s">And</a>  more importantly, Mr. President, to identify the voids that we have here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3307.623s">And</a>  to come up with an action plan to fill these voids so that in the future, families don't feel like they're left alone, that they're out there hanging around on a vine by themselves, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3317.467s">So</a>  I'd like to move that this Committee of the Whole meeting be set up as soon as possible, and that Medford Overcoming Addiction be invited, Mr. President, to share their stories and to share their successes and to point us in the right direction.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3329.531s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3330.211s">And</a>  just so you're aware, what Councilor Camuso and I have been talking about is trying to <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3335.867s">The</a>  resolution was so broad in the scope of people that were requested to be part of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3342.869s">We're</a>  trying to work with that broadness to contact people and then set up a date that's mutually convenient within the realization that this is a matter of urgency. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3357.094s">Thank</a>  you for your recommendation, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3359.394s">Councilor</a>  Lococo.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3360.455s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3365.48s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3366.681s">I,</a>  too, want to just thank Janelle for coming and having the courage to come forward and, I think, fight for a real lot of people, whether it's families, those who are suffering. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3379.706s">What</a>  you're doing is huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3381.327s">The</a>  power of a story can move somebody, can touch somebody. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3384.949s">And</a>  you did it in front of all these people and people watching from home. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3388.13s">Mr.</a>  Garrity lit a fire under our butts, to say the least. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3394.975s">It's</a>  courageous for Mrs. Garrity and Mrs. Butler to come forward, and I thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3400.139s">This</a>  council has been talking about it, and we haven't been talking about it for long enough, but the last few months, it seems like it's a crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3408.644s">It's</a>  an epidemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3409.544s">It's</a>  across the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3411.025s">It's</a>  what was mentioned before. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3412.386s">Something</a>  that's in this heroin is killing people, and it's breaking my heart, obviously. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3421.572s">I</a>  hear of somebody, like I said, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3423.263s">I</a>  think last week or the week before, almost every week you hear of somebody passing away. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3428.067s">And</a>  we need to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3431.289s">I</a>  agree with what my council colleagues have said. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3434.052s">You</a>  know, we discussed a task force. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3436.594s">We</a>  discussed committee meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3438.195s">We've</a>  asked the mayor for help. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3440.236s">We</a>  really do need to move forward on this and be proactive and get something done, get help for people. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3448.363s">And</a>  the biggest thing Janelle said, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3450.232s">is</a>  awareness, raise awareness. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3451.813s">Just</a>  coming here tonight, you're raising awareness. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3454.675s">We've</a>  talked about it four or five times in the last few months, and we're doing our part, but to have actual stories, the awareness level just rises that much higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3465.603s">And</a>  like you said, Councilor Camuso, if you can save one person from each time we speak on this, or help one family, it's worth it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3473.689s">And</a>  I hope that Mayor McGlynn does get behind this on a compassionate and sincere level <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3480.098s">because</a>  that's the only way we can move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3482.358s">We</a>  need the administration's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3484.359s">We</a>  need this council, the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3487.459s">We</a>  also need public health. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3488.96s">We</a>  need a doctor or we need somebody from the health department in the city on that task force. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3496.141s">I</a>  mean, prescription drugs are a huge problem, and it's sometimes what leads to this heroin addiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3503.602s">So</a>  I think the right people, a great deal of people, need to step forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3509.055s">go</a>  to the city council meeting, attend this vigil. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3512.056s">I</a>  mean, the more awareness we can bring forward to this, this city, the better, and I hope it saves lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3517.619s">And</a>  I thank you for being here.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3524.662s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3527.384s">And,</a>  um, you know, those, those statements were very powerful that were, uh, mentioned here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3535.287s">And</a>  as I'm aware and many people are aware, the first step to recovery is to admit that there's a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3544.332s">That's</a>  the first step. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3546.193s">And</a>  I don't think that this community, and when I say the community, the residents, the elected officials, the public safety officials, have taken the first step yet to admitting there's a problem in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3560.36s">And</a>  I, as a member of the council, would like to see us as a council tonight <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3565.877s">send</a>  out a message as a council stating that we believe that there's a major concern with drugs in our community, and there's many addictions. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3577.943s">We</a>  heard some stories here tonight, and I thank my colleagues for sharing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3581.304s">I</a>  shared a story that I had. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3582.685s">My</a>  father was addicted to gambling and tore our family apart when I was a youngster with four kids in the home. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3589.808s">And,</a>  you know, it's a different addiction, but <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3594.171s">Many</a>  people experience many different types of addictions, whether it's drug, whether it's womanizing, whether it's gambling. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3602.816s">There's</a>  a lot of different addictions out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3605.558s">And</a>  I would like tonight for us to take a vote, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3609.82s">I</a>  know we voted to set up roundtable discussions, but I think we should, as a community, because as the gentleman mentioned tonight, and he really put it forward that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3623.046s">When</a>  he looked at members of the council, he saw blank stares. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3626.989s">And</a>  I'll be the first to say, I wasn't aware of how many people have died over the last few years from overdoses. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3634.393s">I've</a>  heard about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3635.394s">I've</a>  known people, absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3637.996s">But</a>  I wasn't aware of the epidemic that was going on in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3643.499s">And</a>  I think tonight was a real eye-opening. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3650.724s">Tonight</a>  was a real eye-opening. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3653.457s">when</a>  you hear firsthand accounts of what's taking place in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3658.781s">And</a>  we can no longer turn a blind eye anymore in this community and pretend that nothing's happening because we're the city of Medford and, you know, we're a great community and things like that don't happen in Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3673.212s">As</a>  we heard tonight, it happens in every socioeconomic, on all different levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3679.757s">No</a>  one's immune to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3682.577s">It's</a>  evident, even when you turn on the TV and see famous movie stars that are going through the same addictions and have passed away. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3691.14s">And</a>  this is not to any particular class, not to particular to any ethnicity. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3698.002s">This</a>  impacts everyone, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3701.223s">And</a>  I really would like to take a vote tonight of this council going on record, saying that we believe there's an epidemic in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3709.77s">that</a>  needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3711.831s">We</a>  may need to call in state officials in this also, state delegation, you know, and to this, Mr. President, whatever it takes. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3721.534s">But</a>  I think it's about time that we put the same emphasis, as was mentioned tonight, on fixing potholes in our roads, on making sure that we have public safety and making sure that the community is operating well. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3738.71s">And</a>  in one aspect, we have a part of the community that many people aren't aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3743.994s">It's</a>  almost like an underground thing that's going on that many people aren't aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3749.617s">And</a>  I think we have to raise it up and maybe make it a front-page story. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3753.1s">I</a>  know the transcript's here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3754.941s">Make</a>  it a front-page story. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3756.522s">Let</a>  people know what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3758.503s">And</a>  maybe we can bring this community together and fight this very deadly disease, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3764.667s">And</a>  I would move that we take a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3768.243s">by</a>  this council to say that there's an epidemic in this community and that emergency attention is needed to fight this war on drugs and narcotics in this community, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3788.918s">Go</a>  ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3789.138s">Let</a>  him speak.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3792.18s">Go</a>  ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3792.921s">Oh,</a>  Michael Ruggiero, 18 Pembroke Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3795.566s">I've</a>  been doing some research on heroin addiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3798.887s">The</a>  numbers are staggering. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3800.407s">Currently,</a>  right now, in America, about a million people are believed to be addicted to heroin, not mentioning the lives that have lost, the stories that we've heard today. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3810.449s">But</a>  $20 billion have lost in crime that's generated. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3814.59s">It's</a>  obviously a problem that Medford needs to deal with. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3817.05s">One</a>  thing I want to bring up, however, that has only been touched on the periphery tonight, is how methadone is one of the most proven treatments to handle actual <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3825.65s">long-term</a>  heroin abuse. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3828.572s">It</a>  is often believed that methadone clinics will increase crime in a community, but there's no evidence of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3834.916s">If</a>  anything, there's evidence that long-term treatment facilities actually help. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3839.199s">So</a>  I just wanted to bring to the Council's attention, perhaps, while committees are certainly useful in uncovering solutions, perhaps one thing that needs to be considered is methadone treatment in the country.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3860.618s">Councilor</a>  Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3863.279s">This</a>  is one of the very few times that I guess I'm lost for words because it's maybe Councilor Camuso, maybe you hit it right in the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3870.503s">The</a>  fact of the matter is, I look at this as the evil empire of a disease that apparently has come into our community and it's been neglected. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3880.988s">And</a>  it's roared its ugly head to such a point that this demon of a disease now <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3888.307s">has</a>  brought folks who are dealing with this on a daily basis to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3895.292s">And</a>  I think we all are. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3896.953s">I'll</a>  speak for myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3899.714s">In</a>  the family, yes, there is. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3901.356s">So</a>  I'll just leave it at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3903.137s">I</a>  have an understanding as to what's being said. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3906.479s">But</a>  my opinion would be this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3909.361s">I</a>  think the city needs to make a full-fledged financial, educational, and social, and a budgetary commitment <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3916.587s">that</a>  if we're really going to be serious, we're going to take this right down to the lowest level of education, starting with the kids who are in nursery school, not nursery, what's the next level? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3925.956s">First</a>  grade, and all the way up, and let them understand the danger of what this disease is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3932.883s">You</a>  know, Councilor Caraviello talked about his friend, 61 years old, Councilor Camuso, his age just a little bit younger. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3939.317s">There's</a>  other folks even younger, and there are adults, mothers and fathers who sometimes become addicted. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3945.323s">For</a>  why it happens, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3948.506s">But</a>  if this city has the good fortune to go out of its way to raise over a million dollars for a brand new peace garden, they can go out of its way to find the necessary tools to have a budget appropriation that's going to deal with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3964.76s">as</a>  part of the medical justification why the city of Medford does care about its inhabitants, its students, its families, its mothers, its fathers, and anyone who might have an addiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3976.83s">I</a>  think tonight is a big wake-up call for this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3980.052s">For</a>  the folks that came up there and spoke, was it hard to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3983.495s">It</a>  certainly was hard, but I think you're really relieved that you came up here and said it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3988.075s">because</a>  you've now got the entire council, I'll leave Councilor De La Ruza to himself, you've got at least six councilors speaking right now, and I think we're all in your court. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3997.923s">New</a>  Governor Baker, his second commitment was the opiate problem here in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4004.348s">So</a>  right from the governor's office all the way down, there is going to be nexus as to how this city and where this city should be going. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4011.493s">I</a>  not only concur with you, Councilor Marks, I just think it's, you know, it's been laid under the rug for so long <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4018.503s">And</a>  how do you say it other than the fact, you know, enough is enough? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4024.086s">The</a>  police department, I'm quite sure, can come up here and tell you case after case, story after story, arrest after arrest. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4030.509s">It</a>  does have an impact in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4032.891s">And</a>  why should anybody be afraid to say that particular house or that particular part of the city, you know, there's drugs over there more than another part. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4039.514s">There</a>  should be no drugs at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4041.627s">There</a>  should be no drugs at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4042.968s">And</a>  to get to no drugs at all, friends like Janelle, if you know someone that's on it, you've got to just turn them in and that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4050.054s">It's</a>  the only way you're going to save their life because no one else is either going to do it or they want to get involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4056.178s">You</a>  know, we're seven adults here behind this rail. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4059.921s">And</a>  I'm quite sure they will all agree on this one here. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4062.383s">Do</a>  we want to see this continue on? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4063.804s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4064.004s">Do</a>  we want to see it corrected? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4065.245s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4066.326s">And</a>  the first step is, as Councilman Marks has his resolution going forward, but I honestly think it should be <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4071.791s">stepped</a>  up even further. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4073.272s">I</a>  think a dollar amount should be put into the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4075.393s">I</a>  think there should be a social, educational, and a financial commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4082.616s">And</a>  you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4083.216s">The</a>  newspaper is here right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4085.437s">And</a>  I'd like to have the newspaper report and make this its headline story as it relates to the Medford City Council recognizes the drug problem in the city of Medford, and they're going to demand from the city administration that action takes place <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4097.273s">to</a>  protect those that are either in the program or having drugs, and to protect the families that have children, unfortunately, who are addicted to this, because they need help just as much as the person that's addicted in the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4110.581s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I would hope that you, as leader of our council, conclude by offering not only your support to Councilor Marks' resolution, but let's have the folks walk out of this audience here tonight and recognize they came here <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4123.862s">with</a>  a true and honest and a just purpose, and they did get results tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4128.325s">They</a>  didn't get lip service, they didn't get a press conference, and I thank you for Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4132.408s">You</a>  did bring that up a few weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4134.25s">The</a>  mayor tried a jump shot, but he didn't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4136.572s">You</a>  beat him to the punch because you were legitimate. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4138.673s">The</a>  issue was legitimate, and that's where it belongs. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4141.215s">It</a>  has a smack of legitimacy that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4144.438s">It's</a>  not a phony, come on. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4145.959s">It's</a>  a true reality in life here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4148.721s">And</a>  if drugs are out there, then the first thing to do is you have to recognize it, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4153.265s">Address</a>  it and work to get rid of it slowly. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4156.047s">And</a>  the only way you're going to do that is you're going to have to bring it to the attention of every single person, and starting with just your children at the youngest of age, to let them know that this is not good for their health, their mind, their body, and their spirit. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4167.855s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4175.801s">Good</a>  evening, Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4177.582s">Leo</a>  Sacco, 100 Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4180.153s">Right</a>  now, I work as one of the drug detectives in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4184.575s">I</a>  go to the overdoses. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4187.056s">I've</a>  actually witnessed firsthand what heroin does to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4192.058s">There's</a>  not one person sitting here tonight in front of me, I have not made a drug arrest anywhere near your house. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4198.881s">It</a>  affects every socioeconomic, I mean, the middle class, the lower class, and it's out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4207.105s">And</a>  the heroin's not coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4209.613s">It's</a>  not coming from the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4212.093s">It's</a>  being brought in from other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4213.594s">I'm</a>  sure there's people here now that know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4218.495s">We</a>  have done our best, day in and day out, to try to combat that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4223.395s">The</a>  statistics speak for themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4227.216s">There</a>  isn't a week that doesn't go by in the Medford transcript where I haven't personally arrested somebody for the distribution of heroin. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4234.557s">Just</a>  this past two weeks ago, Mr. Garrity, I'm sorry for your loss. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4240.033s">My</a>  brother played hockey with Mr. Garrity's son. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4243.754s">I</a>  grew up in North Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4245.755s">I</a>  do take this very, very personally, okay, because it hits home. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4252.857s">Two</a>  weeks ago, the Medford Police Department did a search warrant at a house in North Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4259.979s">Very</a>  well known. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4261.36s">I</a>  don't want to get into the particulars, but we got over 20 grams of heroin, substantial amount of cash, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4268.495s">But</a>  all of that was coming from outside the community, and we're allowing it to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4273.676s">I</a>  work with the state police. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4275.496s">We</a>  just got 6,000 Percocet pills right off of the Fellsway, over $47,000 in cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4283.598s">We're</a>  doing our best. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4284.638s">I</a>  understand that as a police department, we should be doing even more to educate the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4291.119s">And</a>  we try, day in and day out, to talk to those people that are addicted. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4295.18s">I</a>  know that there's people sitting here right now <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4297.782s">in</a>  this forum that have their own personal opinion of me and the way I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4303.405s">But</a>  it's because of how close that disease hits home that I am the way I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4311.149s">So</a>  we will do everything in our power as a law enforcement community to help out the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4317.773s">But</a>  we need help. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4319.634s">When</a>  I talk to somebody, the biggest thing is they don't want to snitch. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4322.955s">They</a>  don't want to rap. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4326.132s">We</a>  need help. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4326.892s">The</a>  community needs to pick up the phone and call us. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4331.515s">I</a>  mean, and you have to be persistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4334.237s">You</a>  may not get us in the first time, but you have to call us. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4337.058s">If</a>  there's a problem, we have to be, we have to know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4340.32s">I</a>  have so many contacts. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4341.601s">I</a>  have probation officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4342.762s">I</a>  have people that can get people that are addicted to this disease in the right, that we can steer them in the right direction, but I need their help. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4353.388s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4355.008s">I'm</a>  begging that the community picks up the phone and calls us. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4359.23s">And</a>  then I'll do what I can to get those people the help that they need.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4362.911s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4369.553s">What's</a>  the best phone number to call? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4371.114s">I</a>  mean, who do you ask for? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4373.035s">I</a>  mean, for people that are watching or because a lot of times, you know, even just other issues, whether it's drug related or people trying to report a house, they think drugs are involved and they say they get, you know, kind of turned off by the main office. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4385.094s">Where</a>  do they call? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4386.055s">Do</a>  they call the detectives?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4388.136s">There</a>  is a hotline, 781-391-6767. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4392.518s">And</a>  for anybody that's serious about picking up the phone, I'll give them my business card. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4402.183s">They</a>  can call me 24-7. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4404.044s">I</a>  live in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4405.725s">It</a>  won't be the first time I got woken up about something like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4409.326s">I</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4409.606s">I</a>  take this very personally.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4411.948s">Now,</a>  we know how busy you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4414.905s">bust</a>  right in front of my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4416.646s">I've</a>  seen you working right near my office. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4419.588s">I</a>  saw another one on Millsex Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4421.089s">This</a>  is in the last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4422.51s">So</a>  we know how busy you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4423.771s">Now,</a>  are there, do you have detective committee meetings with regards to how, you know, whether it's communication into the police department, how it's documented, how you can better improve like documentation or your response? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4437.901s">I</a>  mean, is there ways that, or is there ways the city can help you make it more effective?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4629.204s">We</a>  don't have a day yet, because we have so many people to bring in on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4632.546s">That's</a>  what we're working on.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4633.546s">Well,</a>  we ask that you be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4634.687s">I</a>  mean, we need people who care, and we can tell you care.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4637.248s">I</a>  will wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4639.729s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4640.91s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Capiello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4645.375s">You</a>  know, like he says, they make arrests. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4647.676s">I</a>  read the transcript every week, and you see three, four, five arrests. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4651.238s">It</a>  doesn't stop at the police. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4654.039s">These</a>  guys are arrested, and they're back out on the street the next day. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4656.66s">It's</a>  the judges that let people off with just slapping wrists, come back in 90 days, and they never come back in. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4665.744s">So</a>  I mean, maybe it starts with putting the DA officer back in the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4671.747s">I</a>  mean, it's been years since they've been out of there. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4675.233s">I</a>  mean, a small step, but I say it starts in high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4679.195s">If</a>  there's someone there that these people, these kids can talk to, right then, I say, if there's officers out there, they could all rotate as a DARE officer at the high school or at the different schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4692.844s">So</a>  this way, these kids will know they have somewhere to go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4697.227s">Everybody</a>  sees something, say something. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4699.208s">Well,</a>  if these kids, if they have a personal interaction, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4704.368s">at</a>  school with an officer, maybe they won't be afraid to say something.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4706.889s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4710.09s">Sorry.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4711.791s">If</a>  you're going to move that as an amendment, I just asked that Dea would come back and grade school. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4718.213s">So</a>  if I could add, you put that as amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4720.294s">Every</a>  school. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4721.494s">I</a>  think we asked the school committee to implement this within our school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4727.216s">My</a>  daughter is six and a half years old, and I already tried to teach her about drugs.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4731.458s">Start</a>  right in the middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4734.763s">The</a>  elementary schools, as I said, we have enough police officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4738.246s">They</a>  can rotate a different day, a couple days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4742.689s">Whether</a>  they want to volunteer, it's time everybody in the community steps up.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4747.932s">On</a>  the petition of Janelle Rocco, I see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4753.636s">On</a>  the petition of Janelle Rocco, amended by councillors Knight, Mox, Caraviello, and Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4764.272s">Ma'am,</a>  you wish to speak?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4766.073s">Yes,</a>  just quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4767.294s">Hi,</a>  my name is Linda Ciccolo, and I live on Ravine Road in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4771.077s">And</a>  there's been three overdoses on my street, two fatal. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4774.0s">My</a>  son was one that survived. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4776.262s">And</a>  the reason that he survived is because the first responders carried the Narcan. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4780.865s">So</a>  I just wanted to mention how important I think that it is for the fire department and for the police also to carry the Narcan, because again, he's eight months clean, and it saved his life.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4792.459s">I</a>  believe, and I stand to be corrected, are knockout police officers or a fire department being trained on the administration of the process?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4800.003s">I</a>  think so, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4800.804s">I</a>  mean, we as parents, we have the knock-in. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4804.566s">We</a>  have them. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4806.126s">We</a>  take classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4807.507s">We're</a>  from Families and Arms. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4808.808s">We're</a>  trained to use the knock-in. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4810.629s">And</a>  so I just believe that it's real important that the police and the fire carry the knock-in. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4817.473s">Because</a>  again, my son wouldn't be here if it weren't for the first responders. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4821.255s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5542.966s">No,</a>  I don't pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5543.406s">No,</a>  I'm going to pay for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5544.246s">How</a>  much is that fine? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5546.107s">No,</a>  I told the police, I'm not going to pay because I'm going to go to the court because it was not red. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5552.857s">It</a>  was in the traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5553.958s">It</a>  was before the yellow one. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5555.218s">Then</a>  I was coming.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5556.399s">Which</a>  city was that, sir?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5558.079s">It</a>  was in Boston Medical. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5558.6s">Boston</a>  Medical Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5560.421s">Boston</a>  Medical Center, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5561.761s">So</a>  you made your appeal to the city of Boston? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5563.502s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5564.002s">Did</a>  you have your hearing? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5565.563s">Please?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5566.023s">Did</a>  you have your hearing? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5567.224s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5567.704s">No,</a>  I'm not doing it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5569.245s">Next</a>  week?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5570.105s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5570.745s">Next</a>  week.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5571.046s">I</a>  already did everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5571.866s">I</a>  think I'm going to be there maybe, or I don't know, because they're going to send me the data for this one.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5576.828s">And</a>  what about the parking tickets? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5577.929s">What</a>  about those? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5579.329s">How</a>  many parking tickets do you have? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5586.251s">I</a>  think I have two. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5587.892s">Mr.</a>  Chairman, before the license is granted, tickets, and if he's going next week for the hearing, can we hold that off until we get the results?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5594.934s">I</a>  say I'll approve the license and the clerk can hold it until he comes in with proof that he paid these. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5604.037s">Seems</a>  to be a fair stipulation.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5606.157s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5606.798s">Councilor</a>  Marks, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5609.702s">Mr.</a>  President, as part of the paperwork, it asked the petitioner to answer a question whether or not they have any outstanding violations. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5619.084s">And</a>  that is incumbent upon the petitioner to state whether they have any violations or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5626.106s">The</a>  Corey check checks for criminal offender record information and doesn't look, I don't believe, and maybe Councilor Camuso would know this better, I don't believe it looks at outstanding tickets, does it? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5638.92s">the,</a>  the, the Corey, um, maybe it might be a good idea to have along the process somehow, uh, the petitioners of all taxi licenses to submit to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5650.829s">In</a>  addition to the paperwork, um, uh, a record showing that, uh, they are free from any type of liability when it comes to tickets.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5659.616s">If</a>  I was just instructed, uh, counseling marks by the clerk that, uh, uh, the chief examines all aspects of this before he makes his recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5668.707s">of</a>  moving it up to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5670.227s">So</a>  those items would be included under the quarry, under the quarry check.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5676.009s">If</a>  the clerk would like to answer that perhaps. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5684.93s">So</a>  is it safe to say that he met with, uh, individuals on, uh, any violations, you know, and he, you know, to his satisfaction that they had, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5698.762s">told</a>  him what he wants to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5700.102s">We'll</a>  make his recommendation, but he goes a little bit beyond.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5709.544s">So</a>  the chief signing off.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5712.825s">So</a>  the chief signing off, Mr. Clark would, uh, I don't have the paperwork, but the chief might've said on his, uh, did you see a letter attached from the chief on there, which is beyond that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5726.174s">when</a>  he originally filed his application, whatever the chief's recommendation is, but he goes out and looks at everything.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5732.498s">And</a>  if I could introduce from the chair to the record, February 19th, 2015, from the chief, I have reviewed the application for a taxi operator's license and the quarry reports on the following individual and find no information that would render applicant unsuitable for approval.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5758.136s">I</a>  would just say if that's correct, what the chief is telling us, and we go based on the chief, then those two questions within the application itself are meaningless then because the chief is telling us he finds no fault.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5773.482s">He</a>  finds no reason not to give a threshold of acceptability.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5783.468s">There</a>  may be 30 days between the two documents, between his application and the chief's signing off, which might have been rectified in the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5790.99s">But</a>  we were uncertain. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5792.731s">I</a>  don't think that there's any harm in granting the license with the stipulation that- I mean, if a gentleman's going to be driving people in Medford, what if he gets tickets to Medford?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5801.773s">Is</a>  he just not going to pay them? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5802.614s">I</a>  mean, I'd feel more comfortable if he paid his tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5809.275s">And</a>  I can't speak for my other colleagues here.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5812.163s">Um,</a>  so on the motion of council caviar, let the license be granted with the stipulation that, uh, uh, evidence be presented to the clerk before the issuance of the license, uh, that the, uh, parking and moving violations be paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5828.466s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5829.586s">On</a>  that motion, although councilor Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5833.247s">The</a>  Corey check is basically for criminal background check. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5835.507s">It's</a>  not for licenses and it's not for a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5838.468s">So</a>  what the chief is saying is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5840.828s">And</a>  I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5841.628s">as</a>  a city clerk has questioned seven and eight strike that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5846.509s">Well,</a>  six really wouldn't come up under the query, but seven and eight definitely would not come up under the query. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5852.11s">And</a>  I think those need to be, uh, as council max alluded to, I think they need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5856.21s">And</a>  I agree with council Caraviello, um, to hold us in the dance until both of these are resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5861.631s">But</a>  don't forget this application was made getting everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5865.672s">The</a>  chief responded on February 19th and this fellow made his application on January 16th. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5873.448s">This</a>  is what I don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5875.449s">He</a>  filed on January 16th, 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5878.149s">The</a>  last fellow that was up here put his application on December 4th, 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5884.831s">Why</a>  is there such a spread in time before these things get approved?</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5891.332s">December</a>  14th and January 15th?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5894.533s">No,</a>  December 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5895.833s">December</a>  4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5897.154s">The</a>  last gentleman applied December 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5899.914s">This</a>  gentleman applied January 16th.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5903.27s">the,</a>  the holdup, uh, I mean, they fill the application out and then it has to go to the police chief, but we got both. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5913.635s">So,</a>  so we don't, we don't place it on the council agenda until the police chief signs off on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5922.679s">Well,</a>  we've got both. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5923.299s">So,</a>  so the police chief, and I don't know, I don't, I'm not, I'm not, I don't have the police chief's recent, uh, letter of authorization, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5933.014s">but</a>  that's the trigger date for me to put it on the, put it on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5937.175s">So,</a>  I mean, what is the, uh, is the date that the chief responded back on his February 19th? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5942.776s">February</a>  19th is this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5944.416s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5944.756s">So</a>  he wrote the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5946.077s">So</a>  we're taking us, you know, uh, we, we might not, he wrote February 18th. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5951.538s">We</a>  probably didn't receive it till last week, even though he dated it February 19th. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5956.719s">And</a>  then we go and proceed to put them on the agenda.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5958.799s">I</a>  understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5959.439s">But</a>  I don't understand the, both of them came back at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5962.65s">to</a>  be presented before the council, and there's almost a month and a half spread between both applicants.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5968.452s">It's</a>  still the police chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5972.073s">It's</a>  in his hands.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5973.993s">Point</a>  of elucidation, Councilman. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5976.054s">I</a>  spoke with Mr. Castro before the meeting, and he passed in his paperwork.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5982.275s">Individual</a>  was on vacation when he passed it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5984.716s">Individual</a>  got back from vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5986.256s">His</a>  paperwork seemed to have gone missing. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5988.457s">He</a>  had to resubmit the paperwork, was what the story was that he told me. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5992.9s">I</a>  think it would be safe to say that the reason there was a delay was because of a paperwork error administratively, and that it was rectified. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5998.465s">But</a>  at this point in time, the gentleman's before us now.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6000.927s">We</a>  have a motion with stipulations before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6003.249s">Move</a>  the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6004.35s">So</a>  the motion, question has been moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6008.033s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6009.355s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6010.776s">Opposed?</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6083.584s">Motion</a>  of Councilor Caraviello to resort to the regular order of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6087.005s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6087.606s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6090.127s">15-081</a>  offered by Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6092.668s">Whereas</a>  council resolution 15-043 amended by Councilor Marks requesting that the city solicitor report back to the council if a change to the current parking plan allowed 15 to 30 minutes free parking and all business districts would fall under the purview of the traffic commission and <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6112.075s">Whereas</a>  the city solicitor's opinion stated, it is within the jurisdiction of the Traffic Commission to change the 15 to 30 minute free parking and also to change times of enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6122.617s">Then</a>  be it resolved that the Medford City Council seek a letter, send a letter to the Traffic Commission requesting that 15 to 30 minute free parking be implemented citywide in the interest of addressing resident and business owner concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6140.72s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6142.228s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6143.729s">We</a>  received a letter in our packet, a legal opinion from City Solicitor Rumley, and last week's packet dated February 17th. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6153.095s">It</a>  was in regard to paper 15-043, and the resolution that I offered, which many members behind this reeling have offered in the past, was to allow for 15 <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6171.878s">slash</a>  30 minute free parking in our business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6176.139s">Um,</a>  at the time, uh, when it was mentioned by many members of this council and supported by this council unanimously on several occasions, uh, that, uh, we, uh, weren't aware whether the traffic commission, because there is contractual language that exists right now between the city of method and Republic, which does our, uh, parking program, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6199.128s">whether</a>  or not we needed to amend the contract or whether the traffic commission, which is a city commission, had the authority under its jurisdiction to vote for 15 or 30 minute free parking in the business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6217.197s">City</a>  solicitor responded back in the letter and quite clearly stated it's under the jurisdiction of the traffic commission to change the 15 to 30 minute free parking <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6229.028s">and</a>  also the times of enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6231.349s">And</a>  as we all know, several weeks back, the Traffic Commission voted to change the enforcement times from 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6240.133s">to</a>  8 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6242.674s">to</a>  8 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6244.395s">to</a>  6 p.m.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6248.477s">When</a>  was that supposed to become effective? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6251.418s">Because</a>  that's the calls I'm getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6253.339s">When</a>  does the 8 to 6 become effective?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6257.348s">I</a>  honestly don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6258.348s">I</a>  assume once the vote was taken, it becomes effective and they did take the vote on it several weeks back. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6264.331s">I</a>  mean, we'd have to get a clarification from the traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6268.932s">Um,</a>  but so that the hours of operation has changed and I'm requesting, um, that, uh, we provide, uh, free parking at least 15 to 30 minute free parking in our business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6282.065s">Many</a>  business members that I've spoken to, I've heard them loud and clear that this would alleviate a bulk, not all concerns, but a bulk of the concerns for people running in and doing the quick errand, people running in and getting a sandwich in a sub shop, people running in and doing business in their insurance company, people running into the corner store and maybe playing a number. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6307.179s">A</a>  lot of different reasons, getting a newspaper. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6309.661s">This</a>  would alleviate a lot of the people that are just running into the stores for a quick time, and there's no need to feed the meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6318.647s">For</a>  those that want to stay for an extended period of time, 30 minutes or over, then there would be a need after that to feed the meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6329.394s">I</a>  think this will help businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6331.955s">I</a>  think it will help residents that I've been hearing from also that would <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6336.282s">love</a>  to be able to go down into any of our squares, park briefly, do their business, and move on with their daily lives, not having to worry to go up to the kiosk and feed the kiosk, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6352.088s">So</a>  I would ask that we take a vote in this simple request, requesting that the Traffic Commission at their next meeting take up the issue of 15- to 30-minute free parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6365.989s">The</a>  reason why it was worded 15 to 30 minutes, I know the resolutions before this council, I know Councilor Lungo has offered it, I believe Councilor Camuso, Councilor Penta, and, you know, we've all mentioned different times, 15, 30 minutes, but ultimately they're going to make the decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6382.952s">So</a>  if they decide, you know, they might want to do 45 minutes, but I think at least if we put a time in there, 15 to 30 minutes, it gives them a starting block, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6394.545s">So</a>  I would request that this be sent to the Traffic Commission for their immediate review and hopefully approval, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6402.51s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Marks, all those in favor, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6406.994s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6408.615s">Councilor</a>  Marks, thank you for bringing this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6410.956s">I</a>  think that it's appropriate, directs the question to the proper forum, the proper board and commission that is the authority to make these decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6418.862s">Thank</a>  you very much for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6421.725s">I'd</a>  like to amend the paper, Mr. President, by way of a B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6425.708s">And</a>  I would also like to make a request that the convenience fee of $0.35 be waived on all online transactions. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6432.313s">I've</a>  said from the start that that's been a sticking point of mine where you could actually pay for $0.50 of parking and have $0.70 of fees associated with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6439.859s">So,</a>  no question, $1.20 to park for a half an hour and $0.50 worth of parking, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6445.623s">So,</a>  I'd ask that the paper be amended by way of a B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6449.085s">that</a>  would request that the Traffic Commission look into waiving the convenience fee of $0.35 for online transactions when using the park mobile app.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6461.836s">Just</a>  a quick point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6463.437s">The</a>  convenience fee, is that contractual or is that something that's not? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6468.161s">We</a>  got word on that already?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6469.242s">I</a>  believe the convenience fee was something that was arranged between the third party vendor and Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6477.273s">It's</a>  passed on to the consumer, but it's outside the contract with the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6480.295s">That's</a>  my understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6481.316s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6482.717s">So</a>  I don't, I have no problem asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6484.258s">I</a>  think it's a good suggestion, but as long as it's not part of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6487.701s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6488.061s">Councilors.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6488.802s">Councilor</a>  Penta real quick on the convenience fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6490.723s">I</a>  think it was, um, uh, mighty Walsh, the mayor of Boston who was trying to, um, and I believe they have the same system that we have there. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6498.149s">They're</a>  negotiating for 12 and a half cents. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6499.811s">I</a>  believe rather than 35 cents that's presently out there, but that's neither here or there. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6504.767s">I</a>  believe we're dating back to January 16th of this past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6507.988s">One</a>  of the members on the commission, um, Mrs. DeLorenzo, I, you know, I think it was subsequent to the council's request to change this to eight to six. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6517.39s">And</a>  that was sent to, um, uh, council, you know, Mr. Rumbly on February 3rd, a solicitor did render an opinion and he did run her opinion basically saying that it falls within the purview of the traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6529.192s">But</a>  he makes a very interesting note on the second page of his, of his opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6533.663s">He</a>  states, as to the effect of the regulatory rate changes on the contract, quote, substantial change, that impedes or enhances enforcement may result in a negative or positive impact on percentage payments that may be due under the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6550.294s">The</a>  same is true for substantial reduction or increase on parking spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6555.157s">So,</a>  and I believe, again, the argument that was brought up, or our issue was brought up in discussion, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6562.688s">And</a>  that from 7 to 7, you're going from 8 to 6. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6565.79s">That's</a>  a substantial change in the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6567.771s">And</a>  I believe it was you, Councilor Caraviello, I believe, who asked for the review after the first 60 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6574.934s">And</a>  within that 60 days, we're going to have an idea just where they're going, what revenues or lack thereof with the change of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6582.058s">And</a>  if they consider this to be a substantial change in the contract, this is going to have to be reviewed a step further. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6588.161s">I'd</a>  like to just bring one other attention to this whole issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6591.462s">During</a>  this past week, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6594.419s">I</a>  received the following points of concern from residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6598.902s">There</a>  is a lady who walked in Medford square in the CVS and she went to go put the money in the meter and she fell down and she had to be rushed to the Lawrence Memorial Hospital because of, because of just trying to get to the meter where the snow bank was. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6613.493s">Also</a>  in an area that we were told that Republic was going to be apprised as to what's going on, I believe during the past two weeks, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6622.777s">There</a>  was a funeral that took place at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6624.978s">Joseph's</a>  Church on High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6627.519s">And</a>  when the folks came out that went to the funeral mass, their cars were all ticketed and tagged. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6633.281s">And</a>  apparently the good father over there had to go down to the police department or Republic to get that resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6640.923s">The</a>  subsequent concern that came out of that, because they do operate on a Saturday, the priest's concern was, what if there's a wedding? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6649.747s">Are</a>  those people going to be tagged? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6651.366s">that</a>  go to church on Saturday on a wedding. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6653.807s">And</a>  I believe we were told by the Republic that once they knew what was going on, none of these people would be tagged. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6659.851s">And</a>  here it is, they just got tagged two weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6662.633s">And</a>  then during this past Sunday, in the bulletin of the church, there is a notation as it relates to the collaboration of the churches between St. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6672.959s">Joseph's</a>  and St. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6673.699s">Francis.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6674.82s">And</a>  because of the collaboration, they're going to use alternate dates, especially for the Feast <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6681.17s">Easter,</a>  but he indicates over here, we plan and underscore that the fact that we are now in a collaborative, but we also need to work around each parish's schedule and as well as the parking meter times that have become an issue of late. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6696.657s">Now,</a>  we were told that this was not going to be a problem for the churches and for them to put it into the bulletin, having not only a problem already exist, it's obvious that Republic just has not gotten the message. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6709.724s">Once</a>  again, last week I introduced pictures of Republic driving down the street, not having properly marked notices on their car, supposed to be in the back. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6719.03s">All</a>  they had was, all they have now was just a P on the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6722.132s">There's</a>  no telephone number, there's no identification of who they are or what they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6725.815s">So</a>  I really think there are some serious infractions in this particular contract that they have here with the city of Medford.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6732.139s">And</a>  also- I don't want to interrupt you, but my question, if I could from the chair, as I'm going through our, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6739.26s">replies,</a>  I see nothing of the concerns you raised last week were not replied to. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6743.503s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6744.143s">Am</a>  I correct?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6744.703s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6745.644s">I</a>  have not seen anything there yet either. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6747.445s">So</a>  why? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6748.606s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6749.226s">But</a>  the fact of the matter is now, I think it's now been bumped up and escalated. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6753.229s">If</a>  you have one of the churches in our community expressing not only a problem, not only a problem with a funeral, potential problem for a wedding, and now putting it in the bulletin that addresses a community of over 9,700 people, which make up the parish of St. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6768.258s">Joe's,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6769.705s">and</a>  relative to the meat is becoming an issue, the lady falling down in Medford Square having to be taken by an ambulance. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6776.047s">I</a>  just really think that this program really is not business friendly, it's not friendly to the community, and hopefully Councilor Caraviello, when the 60 days are up, we will have numbers to work on, and as far as I'm concerned, I would make a determination that we opt out of this whole program. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6795.374s">It'll</a>  be the best money the city ever paid, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6797.628s">and</a>  bring a city back to some sense of normalcy. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6800.709s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6801.509s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6802.87s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6804.33s">I</a>  know that this doesn't go to the paper that we're talking about, but a few weeks ago, we asked about posting of the times on these meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6813.053s">I</a>  mean, they're not shutting off. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6814.454s">They're</a>  supposed to shut off at a certain time. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6818.175s">But</a>  these machines are going all night. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6820.576s">People</a>  are putting money in there on Sundays. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6822.136s">They</a>  don't know when. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6823.117s">And</a>  they said they were going to come <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6824.833s">and</a>  put the hours of operation on every meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6827.334s">And</a>  as of now, nothing has been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6829.954s">And</a>  it's like, I see people at eight, nine o'clock at night, putting money into the meters and it's taking it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6836.096s">Sundays</a>  too. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6838.917s">We've</a>  had a storm recently every other day here and they're out there tagging.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6843.878s">Then</a>  if we could make that an amendment to council Mark's paper as an inquiry, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6852.601s">to</a>  receive a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6854.803s">These</a>  were things that have been brought up weeks ago that we need to hear back on. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6862.528s">Councilor</a>  Knight to the floor next.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6866.09s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6867.991s">Another</a>  issue that's been brought to my concern that the Traffic Commission should be able to help us out with would be the fact that Republic, when they were here, they represented to us that they'd be more than willing and happy and ready to go over to the Senior Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6879.312s">and</a>  to conduct trainings with the patrons thereof. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6883.093s">And</a>  it's been brought to my attention that although they've been over there once or twice in the past, they've yet to come over actually with the kiosk and do an actual virtual training with the kiosk there in front of people to touch and feel and get comfortable with. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6896.076s">So</a>  I'd also like to amend the paper further and ask that a training be set up at the senior center within the next 30 days, Mr. President, with a virtual kiosk present and available for the people to <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6908.375s">for</a>  lack of a better term, play with.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6910.435s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6911.236s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6911.676s">So</a>  on the motion of, uh, Councilor, uh, marks, uh, amended by councilor care of yellow and councilor night councilor Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6920.218s">I</a>  would like to have my resolution on there also to, I mean, my amendment to that as it relates to the churches. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6925.219s">So</a>  whether it's for a funeral and now for a wedding during the hours that they said that they weren't going to, uh, you know, and it's, it's obvious, you know, for them to put it in the bulletin, it's, it's presented itself as a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6936.562s">Also,</a>  Mr. President, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6938.264s">We</a>  were also told that at the parking commission, maybe three, four weeks ago, that all the city's parking lots would be three hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6949.23s">Nothing</a>  has been changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6950.691s">No</a>  signage has been changed to three hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6954.013s">And</a>  you still have signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6955.474s">You</a>  can go down Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6956.594s">Signs</a>  are bolted to the trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6958.075s">It's</a>  ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6962.338s">This</a>  company is just not doing what it's supposed to be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6965.239s">It's</a>  quite obvious that the mayor doesn't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6967.148s">He</a>  just signs a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6968.129s">He</a>  really doesn't care what the impact is, and it's obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6970.771s">But</a>  I just really think that there is something wrong with how this whole operation is basically taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6977.355s">I</a>  had a lady turn around and tell me, I believe on Governor's Avenue, they changed, by Carlene's over there, they changed the two hours to a 30-minute parking spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6985.481s">The</a>  Traffic Commission approved it in their minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6988.498s">A</a>  lady went out there, and the guy was coming around the street and was going to give her a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6992.019s">I</a>  said, what are you doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6992.779s">She's</a>  only been in. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6993.46s">She's</a>  only inside for 10 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6995.78s">No,</a>  no. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6996.64s">Don't</a>  tell me. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6997.221s">I</a>  mean, I'm watching. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6998.141s">I'm</a>  right there with her. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7000.182s">So</a>  how do they make this arbitrary decision of who's going to be there if there's no way to determine it?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7010.785s">So</a>  as amended by Councilor Penta for those inquiries. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7014.366s">You're</a>  close. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7015.026s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7016.406s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7018.623s">We</a>  did ask one more thing, too, a few weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7021.925s">I</a>  was with Councilor Petra a few weeks ago at the MMA show. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7025.166s">They</a>  have a white screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7026.807s">The</a>  backlighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7029.048s">These</a>  green backgrounds you can't see. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7032.49s">And</a>  the gentleman from the company said it's not a big deal to change it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7036.111s">It's</a>  a little bit more money to change it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7038.352s">Put</a>  the white screen out there so people can see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7040.654s">I</a>  can't see the screen, even during the day, never mind at night.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7046.156s">As</a>  amended by Councilor Caraviello,</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7048.212s">Councilor</a>  Penta, Councilor Camuso.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7050.672s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7051.133s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7052.093s">And,</a>  uh, I do support the main resolution and then Councilor Knight's, uh, amendment as well as, um, Councilor Penta's. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7060.234s">Yeah,</a>  I know we're getting to the point where it's, um, we're getting some time under our belt with this new program, but we still really don't have good data. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7071.836s">As</a>  the councilor mentioned, we've been on a snow emergency now for a couple of months. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7077.395s">You</a>  know, people aren't parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7079.175s">Once</a>  the snow's away, we can really look into making major changes to this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7084.956s">But</a>  at this point, I don't see anything wrong with revisiting the 15 and 30 minutes free parking or something in the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7092.878s">And</a>  if they have to do it at the end of the parking, if that's the only way that the system in place will work, then it's something they should look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7102.779s">But</a>  I just don't know how you're going to enforce the 15 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7106.68s">But</a>  you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7107.697s">This</a>  is what you get paid for here at City Hall to figure it out, and I support the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7112.478s">And</a>  make it work for the people.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7114.739s">If</a>  we could, Councilor Pater. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7116.339s">On</a>  the same thing, what Councilor Camuso just alluded to, whether it's 15 minutes or 30 minutes, you have spots in the city that's an hour or two hours, and there's no kiosks or anything there. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7123.901s">So</a>  how do they make these judgmental calls by going down there and, you know, they're going to take the time and write every number down? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7130.102s">You</a>  know, I saw something interesting the other... It's all in the sky. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7133.043s">Yeah,</a>  I saw something interesting the other day. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7135.567s">I</a>  was on Boston Avenue in the morning, and we saw the car going down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7141.249s">He</a>  was going down, how can you say, going towards Somerville on Boston Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7147.151s">He</a>  was probably going down there to check out the people, and all of a sudden, he must have got a call, and he whipped his rear around, and he blew through that intersection at least 40, Councilman Marks was there, 40 to 50 miles an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7158.135s">He</a>  gave no credit, because going right back to what you said, they probably got a buzzer that went off, that the person in the two hours was already over and beyond, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7166.397s">This</a>  makes no sense how they run this operation that there was no consistency and you know How do you give out a ticket to someone when it's not even? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7173.863s">When</a>  it's a snow emergency these people should know what's going on They should read the newspaper or they should be tied into the weather report that talks about a snow emergency in the city It's just unfair On the motion of Councilor Marks as amended all those in favor.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7190.456s">Oh</a>  Roll call has been requested</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7234.923s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7236.424s">I</a>  received two calls from residents of the Riverside Tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7242.589s">They</a>  were concerned that the hallways seemed to be very cold. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7247.832s">The</a>  residents called the management company and the management company told them that it's their protocol to keep the hallways between <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7256.744s">62</a>  and 68 degrees. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7259.345s">The</a>  woman at the Riverside Tower asked me to go down. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7265.229s">I</a>  went by on my own. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7266.87s">I</a>  went into the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7269.071s">I</a>  stood near, as we all know, the front door, which is accessed a lot, the Riverside Tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7274.675s">And</a>  it was absolutely freezing after the second set of doors in that particular lobby area. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7281.299s">Do</a>  they manage this chamber as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7284.55s">I</a>  don't know if they manage this chamber, but it's about the same degree. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7288.573s">And</a>  I did go on to a couple of the floors, Mr. President, and it seemed to be, I had a coat on too, and it seemed to be somewhat cold in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7298.401s">I</a>  contacted, I looked online and contacted the management company, federal management company, and I have to say, I got an email back immediately from Joseph Moscarello. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7310.691s">He</a>  is the senior property manager for the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7313.632s">And</a>  he also responded via email and phone call back to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7319.216s">And</a>  he mentioned to me that he sent his maintenance person out to each of the floors. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7324.74s">And</a>  they did notice that some of the floors were actually below 62. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7329.944s">And</a>  they're going to try to rectify some of the concerns they're having with the heating system in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7335.087s">He</a>  also mentioned to me, which I found interesting, was the front door. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7339.738s">stays</a>  ajar when it opens automatically for 40 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7343.901s">You</a>  can imagine every time someone comes and goes, and that door stays open for 40 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7349.146s">Needless</a>  to say, they're going to look at the duration of the cycle on that particular front door and see if they can get it closed quicker without also providing some concerns with residents trying to access the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7363.236s">But</a>  I do want to report, Mr. President, that Mr. Moscarello <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7368.301s">seems</a>  to be on top of the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7370.502s">He</a>  said that there would be improvements in the temperature in the hallways, throughout the floors, and assured me that if there were any concerns that the management company, like I said, Federal Management Company, would be more than happy to seek some type of <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7393.243s">a</a>  remedy for residents of that building, Mr. President, so.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7396.785s">So</a>  your motion is?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7398.306s">My</a>  motion is actually to place this, why don't we just receive and place on file.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7409.032s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7409.632s">For</a>  now. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7410.552s">And</a>  seconded by Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7412.554s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7413.754s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7414.835s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7415.635s">Thank</a>  you for that good work, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7417.176s">15-083</a>  offered by Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7423.093s">Be</a>  it resolved that the city of Medford requests the federal EPA that since the proposed MS4 stormwater sewer system permit would require communities to institute more advanced stormwater testing, monitoring and management programs, but is completely silent on funding or mitigation of the additional costs to communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7446.978s">And</a>  since there is no flexibility in the compliance portion of the requirements, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7451.261s">And</a>  since communities are grappling with these huge financial challenges with preliminary projections to be in excess of $800,000 plus per year, per community, we asked the EPA to defer action on the submission of NOIs until municipalities have had the opportunity to engage the regulatory agencies <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7480.002s">in</a>  an open dialogue regarding these onerous and unaffordable permit requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7485.326s">The</a>  aggressive schedule that the EPA proposes for implementation of the MS4 program is unrealistic to provide permittees only 90 days to file their Notice of Intent, NOI, after their permit is finalized, and equally unrealistic to dictate that the Notice of Intent of the Stormwater Management Program <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7508.383s">must</a>  be complete within one year. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7510.765s">Communities</a>  such as Medford would be forced to hire expensive environmental consultants for assistance to complete numerous elements of the program because of lack of staff and technical expertise from years of both state and federal cutbacks in granting grant funding and local aid. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7529.358s">Hiring</a>  these consultants would require compliance with statutory procurement requirements <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7534.966s">and</a>  could be extremely time-consuming as well as costly. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7540.45s">In</a>  the absence of EPA leadership on this issue, a number of Massachusetts communities are already combining messaging by forming stormwater coalitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7554.379s">There</a>  are at least five such coalitions in eastern Massachusetts, serving over 58 communities, 85 communities, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7563.477s">combining</a>  resources and expertise, trying to reduce the individual burden anticipated for communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7569.921s">Whether</a>  Medford joins a coalition or not, it needs to urge the EPA to amend its approach and incorporate goals that are more realistically attainable and within the financial constraints of the current economic climate, or wait until adequate federal funding is available to ensure that these requirements do not translate into another harmful, unfunded, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7592.612s">mandate</a>  on cities, towns, and taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7597.254s">Councilor</a>  Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7598.394s">Mr.</a>  President, I have a whole folder here on this whole idea of this MS-4. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7603.156s">This</a>  has been around for maybe the last couple of years or thereabouts, maybe 2011 when it first came up. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7610.199s">This</a>  mandate would put an absolute tremendous cost upon the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7616.002s">And</a>  as a result of that, especially as the whole resolution recites itself, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7622.134s">They're</a>  giving no help, no assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7624.375s">You're</a>  on your own. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7625.856s">Whether</a>  the city of Medford, again, whether they want to join a coalition or not, it would be up to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7631.2s">But</a>  I just think an $800,000, $900,000 hit on an annual basis for every one of the cities and towns to have to be looking at this right now, especially when we have unfunded retirement benefits that need to be paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7644.969s">Just</a>  as tonight, just looking at the problem with the drugs and that's impact here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7651.412s">But</a>  this is something I really think that the city of Medford needs to do, as other cities and towns are beginning to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7658.457s">Send</a>  letters to the EPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7661.519s">And</a>  they have an address in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7664.721s">It's</a>  5 Boston Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7666.923s">But</a>  I also think that our federal state representatives, Catherine Clark, and Markey, and Warren, need to be on board with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7676.329s">They're</a>  the first ones out there saying, oh, we've got to help the people and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7680.825s">You</a>  can't help the people by giving unfunded mandates such as this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7683.627s">Absolutely,</a>  totally unfunded. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7685.848s">And</a>  they have taken grants away that normally could have been used or would have been used for things such as this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7691.231s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I have no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7694.653s">It</a>  probably would be even more helpful if our city engineer was on board with this or our Department of Public Works. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7701.717s">But</a>  I think at the outset, as a legislative body, as these other 85 cities and towns are doing, they're sending in these letters. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7708.461s">And</a>  basically, you're just asking them <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7710.242s">to</a>  delay it until you're ready to put a practical program in place that cities and towns can take a look at and can see. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7717.588s">The</a>  way this thing is set up right now, if you have a street sweeper that goes down the street, you can't even have that street sweeper anywhere near a gutter because of what it's going to be able to go in there, because that's part of the stormwater drain. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7729.437s">So</a>  there's a whole host of things that are implied with this, like I said. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7734.901s">This</a>  has been going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7736.282s">I</a>  have all this stuff here. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7737.868s">Uh,</a>  but this is really, that's the issue of the resolution is, is the gut of the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7742.269s">And,</a>  um, the point person, uh, well, the point person for the city would be the city engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7747.63s">Cause</a>  they're, and, and, uh, Paul gear, who happens to be the director of public works, but it's, it's an issue that the city just cannot handle. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7755.611s">They</a>  don't have the personnel and they don't have the expertise. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7758.812s">Um,</a>  they may be expertise enough to understand what needs to be done, but we don't have the tools to implement this thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7764.833s">And</a>  we don't have any resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7766.395s">that</a>  the federal government are now imposing upon cities and towns, where the federal government should be having these workshops, should be having cities and towns go there to understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7776.158s">And</a>  when you get your notice of intent permit, have it in more of a reasonable way, not 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7781.34s">And</a>  then you have to have the whole program complete within a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7783.721s">It's</a>  a cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7785.097s">It's</a>  huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7785.618s">It's</a>  900,000 or thereabouts.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7786.398s">This</a>  is a major federal administrative overreach of power, which is typified, I must say.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7793.463s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7794.244s">So</a>  I have no problem to take the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7798.547s">We</a>  can work with it, add or subtract to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7800.708s">But</a>  the EPA is in Boston at 5 Post Office Square in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7805.391s">And</a>  I believe that they are and they will accept comments as it relates to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7812.236s">And</a>  I believe the more comments they get, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7814.138s">They'll</a>  have an understanding that we can't go forward with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7816.759s">But</a>  I think it's also beneficial, again, that our federal delegation becomes on board with this, too, because they can say, well, it needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7826.122s">A</a>  lot of things need to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7827.922s">But</a>  we've had so many unfunded mandates. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7829.923s">Leave</a>  No Child Behind is one, which is an educational mandate. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7833.364s">But</a>  this is something that's really huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7835.264s">And</a>  this isn't just a one-shot deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7836.865s">This</a>  is every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7837.725s">You're</a>  going to have to deal with this thing every single year. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7839.686s">And</a>  you're going to have to buy the equipment and the tools and everything that goes with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7844.31s">I'd</a>  like to, um, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7846.592s">What</a>  do you want to do with it? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7847.632s">I,</a>  I would just like to send the letter off to the EPA and then just refer it upstairs and hopefully that the city administration does what they're supposed to do.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7857.48s">Well,</a>  perhaps we should have a report back from the city engineer.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7861.182s">You</a>  could do that.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7863.524s">And</a>  then refer it to the mayor's office if it needs to go out under the aegis of the city of Medford.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7870.057s">So</a>  if we could, uh, legislative bodies, administrative and legislative bodies, we have a mayor, other cities and towns have city managers, but they have been soliciting, um, commentaries from legislative bodies, which is councils as well as the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7885.327s">So</a>  it just adds to the impact of recognizing that there is a cost involved in getting to that cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7891.33s">There's</a>  just no preparation. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7892.931s">It's</a>  onto the cities and towns.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7894.532s">So,</a>  uh, if we could then have, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7897.571s">the</a>  city engineer report back to the council as to the progress of this while at the same time, the council sending out its a request to the EPA Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7909.959s">Um,</a>  thank you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7911.32s">I</a>  think it's a great idea to have the city engineer report back to us as to where we are in terms of compliance, what the cost is going to be for the taxpayers here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7919.866s">Um,</a>  I think it's also important to take a look that if in fact this program is delayed, what effect it's going to have on our watershed. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7925.862s">I</a>  think we have a lot of questions that need to be answered, Mr. President, and I certainly don't have a problem asking those questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7930.845s">However,</a>  until those questions are answered, I'd be opposed to sending a letter off to the EPA.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7935.167s">Mr.</a>  President, the Watershed Association has nothing to do with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7939.49s">This</a>  is an EPA mandate as it relates to our wastewater disposal and how it's going through, and whether it's through the – just how it's leaving the city, or all cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7953.357s">And</a>  this is something where 85 cities and towns <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7955.77s">have</a>  now, either through a coalition or independently, are asking the federal government to put a hold on this and waiting until appropriate federal funding is available to ensure that these requirements don't translate into a financial burden. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7968.779s">There's</a>  no workshops being held up on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7972.102s">I'm</a>  quite sure that our city engineer is aware of this, but like I said, this is now coming through after meeting and having this discussion and reviewing what <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7985.023s">85</a>  cities and towns are now doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7986.304s">So</a>  it's just, you know, we're not going to be novel on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7989.845s">This</a>  is a direct approach of an unfunded mandate from the federal government.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7993.726s">So</a>  then the answer to the question is that we're going to refer this to the city engineer for report back to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8000.088s">And</a>  then having heard that we'll then take further action.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8003.889s">So</a>  on that motion and or the city council can take its own independent action after whatever she does.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8011.632s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8012.682s">On</a>  that motion, all those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8014.282s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8014.782s">All</a>  those opposed unanimously. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8017.863s">Uh,</a>  past 15 Oh, 84 offered by consulate Penta be resolved that the method that method resident Andrew Sano, a realtor with remax Andrew realty services of Medford and Stonium be congratulated on being named the 2014 Massachusetts realtor of the year by the Massachusetts association of realtors. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8041.16s">This</a>  highly recognized professional business honor was bestowed upon Mr. Sano at the Massachusetts Association of Realtors' annual professional awards reception, which was held at the Massachusetts Realtors' annual meeting in North Falmouth.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8056.823s">Counsel</a>  Penton? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8057.823s">In</a>  June of 2014, Mr. Sano had his name placed in nomination for Retailer of the Year after he received the award of the Greater Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8066.844s">And</a>  the competition to become the Realtor of the Year <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8070.452s">put</a>  him into 15 real estate associations, and in competition with 20,000 individuals whose name came up for review for the particular purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8081.755s">If</a>  anybody does know Mr. Sano, he works at Remax in Medford Square, Remax Andrew Realty. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8087.976s">He's</a>  completely dedicated not only to his job, to his family, but the whole idea of being a professional in this particular job. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8097.098s">And</a>  I believe anyone that knows him, especially in that office, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8100.8s">They</a>  will tell you on a daily basis he lives, sleeps, and eats, being a good real estate person for whoever his client might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8112.086s">Also,</a>  he's also well known in the regional area of realtors and the greater Boston leadership because of commitment to doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8121.51s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to have Mr. Sano come before the council, receive the award, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8128.131s">for</a>  which was given out, I believe, this past December by the vice president of, I guess, the State of the Professional Awards reception this past December. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8139.136s">And</a>  it would be nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8139.956s">You</a>  know, we seem to be blessed having certain business folks in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8145.378s">You</a>  know, most recently we just had Dr. Lepore receive a piece of legislation that was passed long overdue as it relates to <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8153.588s">wind</a>  instruments and helping to protect people not to get any diseases from using it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8158.389s">We</a>  have Victor Garrow, who made national acclaim by defending a person for 30 years and bringing justice to someone not being found guilty for a crime that he didn't commit. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8168.252s">And</a>  here we have now a local realtor here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8171.413s">We</a>  have three people from three different walks of life, and I just think folks like that need to be recognized. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8178.469s">and</a>  let people know that in our city of Medford, there are many citizens of the year, and they come from many walks of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8185.554s">So</a>  that being said, I'd like to have Mr. Clark, we can get in touch with Mr. Sano and have him come to a future council meeting.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8208.507s">to</a>  congratulate state representative Paul J. Donato on being promoted to second assistant majority leader. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8217.212s">Councilor</a>  Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8218.352s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8220.293s">As</a>  we all know, state rep Donato has done a great job delivering for the community here. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8225.276s">And</a>  once again, he has been appointed a higher position. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8230.799s">It</a>  seems like every two years, representative Donato has been moving through the ranks. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8235.301s">So</a>  he just <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8237.36s">We've</a>  got one more promotion in the ranks of leadership, and for that I want to congratulate him. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8241.683s">And</a>  hopefully this will allow him to bring more funding to Medford for all the projects that are so important to the quality of life here in our community.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8249.327s">Congratulations</a>  to Representative Donato, who's undoubtedly one of the hottest working men or persons on Beacon Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8257.152s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8258.593s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Camuso for approval, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8264.437s">Offered</a>  by Councilor Caraviello, be it resolved that the City Solicitor and Code Enforcement Officer report back to the Subcommittee on licensing if all taxi owners and companies are in compliance on the City of Medford Vehicle for Hire Ordinance, Section 90-37, Owner's License. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8285.221s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello, and I notice you've also called for a Subcommittee meeting, if you want to share with us.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8292.143s">All</a>  the owners are all going to be coming up for renewal, I think April 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8295.585s">So</a>  along with the help from the clerk and the solicitor, every two weeks, I mean every week, the committee will bring in two different taxing companies along with some way bills in the form of the new rules that we'll be having. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8308.773s">And</a>  hopefully we'll get some rules in place and move on with this.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8314.517s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8315.397s">Councilor</a>  Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8316.498s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8317.39s">I</a>  think this is something we should also have Bill Timmons get involved with. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8321.693s">This</a>  is actually a part of his job he should be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8324.596s">So</a>  if maybe we could get him there for, um, for this very important meeting, uh, I'd like to make sure he's part of this cause we all know, uh, he can issue fines as well as he's the person that certifies the meters every April. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8338.947s">Uh,</a>  so he's a front and center and more importantly, he's had dealings with all these, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8344.984s">companies</a>  and licenses, so we want to get some input from him on the way they're doing their business and if he feels that they're a reputable business to continue within the confines of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8358.852s">Thank</a>  you for a good council. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8360.033s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8361.354s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8363.763s">I'd</a>  like to commend Councilor Caraviello on tackling this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8367.625s">In</a>  my time on the Council, we've had a lot of discussion about taxi licenses, about the ordinance that's in place, about whether or not it's outdated. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8375.249s">And</a>  I think that an appropriate first step would be auditing these companies to determine where they're in compliance and where they're in non-compliance so that we can move forward and develop a comprehensive ordinance and make some changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8385.675s">The</a>  city clerks work very hard on putting something together that mirrors what they've done in Brookline, which seems to be a rather extensive and comprehensive ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8393.935s">I</a>  think that Councilor Caraviello's course of action is an appropriate one where we'll meet weekly or bi-weekly in order to hash this out and get it wrapped up hopefully before the end of the legislative session, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8403.183s">But</a>  I stand in full support. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8404.844s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8405.244s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8406.225s">And</a>  on the motion for approval by Councilor Caraviello, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8409.848s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8410.649s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8413.171s">Do</a>  we get everything? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8416.413s">Records.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8417.815s">Councilor</a>  Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8419.616s">In</a>  that packet, we received a letter from the mayor <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8422.39s">uh,</a>  dated February 27th, as it relates to the, uh, um, the GIC situation that we discussed last week in the letter, um, they may have make some mistake on the right in the beginning, uh, plan design rest for GIC. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8435.998s">There</a>  will be a voting on the rates on their upcoming March 3rd meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8439.861s">It</a>  isn't March 3rd, it's tomorrow, March 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8442.743s">And</a>  for those who might be interested in this March 4th meeting, which is tomorrow, and I believe it's at eight 15 or between eight 15, eight 30, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8451.101s">You</a>  can attend the meeting, but they're not going to allow public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8454.383s">So</a>  that unfortunately seems to set another tempo here. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8458.524s">Also</a>  in the letter, basically substantiates, I think, what we discussed last week, at least what I said. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8465.327s">The</a>  unfortunate part of the GIC program, it's been intentionally underfunded for the past three years, and they never took it into any consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8473.65s">And</a>  when they were doing their budgetary process, the prior administration, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8478.523s">They</a>  never took into consideration the additional people who were joining GIC and that the end of federal funds were not being forthcoming to the Commonwealth of Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8491.688s">So</a>  the cost of approximately $162 to $197 million is the cost right now, unfortunately, that GIC is going to be held accountable for to make whole this whole idea of those cities and towns that are in the GIC program. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8507.473s">Another</a>  thing, another major change that they have made, it's going to go from an annual January to December to a fiscal year, which will be July 1st to June 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8516.88s">And</a>  one of the keys in here is as follows, and I think it just segues itself into what we talked about last week, which is the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8526.466s">It</a>  states, the GIC members can only change from an individual to a family or a family to an individual coverage with the qualifying event, which is marriage, birth, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8536.647s">adoption</a>  of a child, change in the dependent eligibility, divorce, pursuant to subject matter chapter 32A, eligibility requirement, death of a spouse, dependent or a spouse, or dependence and voluntary loss of coverage elsewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8551.974s">Now,</a>  by having that, that one-time event, and coupling that with Harvard Health and Tufts going from a PPO to a POS, the next part that seems to be an unqualified issue <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8565.605s">is</a>  the fact that anyone who's in PPO and goes to a POS, whether it be in Tufts or Harvard, if you have a particular doctor in a particular hospital that are not in it, you cannot go to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8577.69s">You</a>  lose that doctor. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8578.931s">You</a>  lose that hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8580.731s">So</a>  what was said before is, while the 85-15 might stay the same, there is a huge, there will be a 6% to 12% increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8591.376s">That's</a>  what it looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8592.696s">The</a>  projection is going to be <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8594.527s">at</a>  tomorrow's event for them to take the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8598.769s">This</a>  administration, the Baker administration, I believe, is committed to offsetting by a supplemental budget, getting close to that $192 million, which appears to be the magic number right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8611.556s">But</a>  also, with that being said, the issue of whether, in fact, monies are going to be forthcoming in the future as it relates to offsetting that, that's going to be another issue unto itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8624.613s">I</a>  think what needs to take place, and if I understand the gentleman who came here last week and indicated we're locked in until 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8632.474s">Now,</a>  the only thing that we're locked into is the percentage rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8636.035s">We're</a>  not locked into keeping the rates what they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8639.736s">The</a>  city of Medford, as well as each subscriber, is going to have to wind up paying for this in some shape, manner, or form. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8646.697s">So</a>  if you're a current employee, you're a retiree, a survivor, a school teacher, a policeman, a fireman, a municipal employee, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8654.743s">are</a>  going to pay for this effective July 1st with the rates that will be forthcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8660.665s">One</a>  of the things that were brought up in discussion, and it was a point made really applicable by the Mass Teachers Association and the American Teachers Association, and their claim is quite candid, that they honestly feel that this whole health care cost, which is an outrageous cost, is being driven by insurance companies because <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8682.295s">The</a>  driving of these rates are going up because of the claims. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8686.856s">And</a>  the claims are being predicated by people going to more expensive either hospitals or more expensive doctors. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8692.537s">Now,</a>  when the program and the problem was being introduced, strike that, when the whole insurance issue was being introduced, I believe in 2011, for which the city of Medford jumped on board, effective July, January 1st of 2012, the whole idea was to reduce our insurance cost here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8710.761s">Let's</a>  just talk about the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8713.272s">And</a>  that would have worked very well, and I think everybody recognized the fact that their co-pays and their family costs were going to go up as part of joining this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8721.235s">But</a>  the city of Medford indicated that they would be saving approximately $25 to $26 million over a four-and-a-half, five-year period of time.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8728.959s">Is</a>  this your presentation from last week?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8731.24s">No,</a>  this is the presentation of today, attending the meeting that the governor was at, and we had this discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8738.202s">You</a>  don't mind, do you? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8738.923s">It's</a>  information that is forthcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8740.764s">And</a>  as a result of that, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8742.175s">This</a>  information is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8743.717s">So</a>  anyone who was on GIC here in the city of Medford, Unicare, that seems to be the difference between Tufts Health and what's the other one? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8754.812s">I</a>  just forgot it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8758.776s">And</a>  what is the other one? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8760.637s">I</a>  just forgot the other name. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8762.338s">Well,</a>  anyway, Harvard Health, Tufts Health and Harvard Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8764.94s">So</a>  the tradeoff is going to be your fees and costs are going to be higher in Tufts Health and Harvard Health, but Unicare may be at an issue where they might either be the same or they may go down. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8777.41s">But</a>  the real major concern is anyone who has their PPO is going to go to a POS, you are going to lose <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8784.777s">If</a>  you lose your doctor or the hospital associated with it that you had before, and the PPO, and it's not found in the POS, then you cannot go to that doctor. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8793.138s">You're</a>  going to have to find another doctor in another hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8795.539s">So</a>  these are one of the diminishing things that are taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8798.459s">And</a>  now we're up to 60 communities, 60 communities that seem to be ready to jump on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8803.94s">We</a>  were at 50 at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8805.08s">Now</a>  we're up to 60 cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8807.141s">And</a>  again, the argument is the larger the numbers, the lower the cost should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8810.741s">But</a>  it's not working out that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8812.442s">And</a>  one of the big stumbling blocks <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8814.299s">The</a>  Patrick administration, for three years in a row, underfunded intentionally the liability that was necessary to be paid in that GIC program. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8823.843s">And</a>  that's where we're at right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8825.704s">So</a>  what started off as a $320 million deficit, when the Patrick administration said they were passing a budget that's current and it's level, it's now up to, I think, almost $900 million, a shade under a billion dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8839.93s">And</a>  these are one of the areas, unfortunately, that are being taxed. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8844.058s">Hopefully,</a>  the mayor who was the negotiator in behalf of this can recognize the wherewithal to do something that offsets before 2017 no further increases that we would have to pay here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8858.226s">I</a>  don't know what the relationship is between Harvard and Pilgrim with employees, retirees, and survivors as compared to Unicare, but that does and that will have an effect upon the city of Medford.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8872.514s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8873.82s">The</a>  records. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8874.72s">Wait</a>  a minute, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8875.821s">Tabled.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8879.002s">Records.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8880.003s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8880.743s">I</a>  want to leave the records for this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8882.824s">Records</a>  of the tabled records of the February 17th, 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8886.265s">That's</a>  not me. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8888.006s">Were</a>  passed to Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8890.507s">Did</a>  you have a chance to inspect those? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8892.748s">I</a>  have not. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8893.228s">We'll</a>  get that done next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8895.749s">Then</a>  the motion to retable them. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8897.069s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8897.77s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8899.17s">February</a>  24th. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8899.51s">Records</a>  are retabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8901.371s">Records</a>  of February 24th were. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8903.824s">pass</a>  to Councilor Knight for inspection.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8908.709s">But</a>  if Council President, Councilor Penta has an issue, I'll be happy to sit with them and talk about it and we can figure it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8913.433s">So</a>  we'll table them until next week.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8915.755s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight to table those records as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8920.18s">Records</a>  are tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8922.782s">And</a>  on the motion of the Vice President for Lungo-Koehn, motion to adjourn.</p>
