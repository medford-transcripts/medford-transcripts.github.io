[SPEAKER_16]: And for the benefit of the viewing public at home and those present here tonight, I've just been reminded by Councilor Penta that we're under a snow emergency right now in the city of Medford.

32
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:51,698
[SPEAKER_16]: Ma'am, if you would, please state your name and address for the record.

33
00:01:51,758 --> 00:01:54,699
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, May Markeybrook, 16 Glenwood Ave., Medford.

34
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,001
[SPEAKER_24]: Good evening, President DelaRusso and members of the council.

35
00:02:01,903 --> 00:02:14,465
[SPEAKER_24]: Tonight I'm here representing the committee who is organizing the 75th anniversary of the celebration, and the celebration of the Shroudier Theatre.

36
00:02:16,126 --> 00:02:28,428
[SPEAKER_24]: Members of the committee are Tom Kozachek, Ken Kraus, John Kostas, and Cindy Watson, and out of town at the moment is Susan Fairchild.

37
00:02:31,055 --> 00:02:40,877
[SPEAKER_24]: First of all, I wish to extend our condolences to Joe Grandi and his family on the recent passing of Geraldine Grandi.

38
00:02:42,178 --> 00:02:48,899
[SPEAKER_24]: Jerry served as chairperson of the Shrouded Commission for 35 years and loved the theater.

39
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:59,122
[SPEAKER_24]: In this time, she worked tirelessly to rehabilitate the building, to bring it to the present first class,

40
00:03:00,212 --> 00:03:01,673
[SPEAKER_24]: theater that it is today.

41
00:03:04,055 --> 00:03:11,681
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll be thinking about Jerry on Saturday when we celebrate the 75th anniversary of the dedication of the Method High School Auditorium.

42
00:03:13,022 --> 00:03:29,535
[SPEAKER_24]: On March 7, 1940, city officials and citizens came together to name the auditorium in memory of Lieutenant Commander Godfrey Chevalier, who, remember, was a pioneer in naval aviation.

43
00:03:30,758 --> 00:03:32,359
[SPEAKER_24]: and a war hero from Medford.

44
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:41,665
[SPEAKER_24]: One of his most important accomplishments was when he was the first aviator to land a plane on a moving ship.

45
00:03:43,686 --> 00:03:58,035
[SPEAKER_24]: About a month after that event, unfortunately, Godfrey Chevalier was in an accident, a plane crash in Virginia, which resulted in his death at age 33.

46
00:03:59,898 --> 00:04:00,318
[SPEAKER_24]: That was in 1922.

47
00:04:00,898 --> 00:04:07,760
[SPEAKER_24]: We're proud of Godfrey Chevalier and of the history of the Chevalier Theatre.

48
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,681
[SPEAKER_24]: It has played an important role in this community.

49
00:04:12,341 --> 00:04:18,103
[SPEAKER_24]: For 30 years, high school graduates walked across its stage to receive their diplomas.

50
00:04:19,563 --> 00:04:21,244
[SPEAKER_24]: I can still remember my graduation.

51
00:04:22,824 --> 00:04:26,405
[SPEAKER_24]: The auditorium was also a host to many civic events, pageants,

52
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:33,092
[SPEAKER_24]: and especially wonderful stage performances by the Medford-based Mystic Players.

53
00:04:34,612 --> 00:04:41,755
[SPEAKER_24]: When the high school was relocated to Winthrop Street in 1970, the history and condition of the building changed dramatically.

54
00:04:42,855 --> 00:04:48,757
[SPEAKER_24]: It was vacant, ignored, and fell into major disrepair.

55
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,340
[SPEAKER_24]: It was not until 1980 when the city of Medford

56
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:08,458
[SPEAKER_24]: the property owners of the building, upon receiving a $1.2 million grant from the State, established a Civic Auditorium and Convention Center Commission.

57
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:26,551
[SPEAKER_24]: Under the direction of this group of volunteers, major improvements such as an elevator, new lobby and restrooms, and a stair tower and stage right were made

58
00:05:28,718 --> 00:05:31,779
[SPEAKER_24]: in compliance with ADA regulations.

59
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:52,204
[SPEAKER_24]: Additional funds from the Friends of Chevalier and Gene McJim, the City of Medford, have contributed to the rehabilitation, along with major funds secured by Representative Paul Donato, to replace the original wooden seats with comfortable cushion seats.

60
00:05:53,624 --> 00:05:56,745
[SPEAKER_24]: The Chevalier Theatre is now a first-class performing arts center

61
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,751
[SPEAKER_24]: for the community to enjoy.

62
00:06:01,113 --> 00:06:09,459
[SPEAKER_24]: For this 75th anniversary of Chevalier, several groups have collaborated in organizing and presenting a tribute to the theater.

63
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:26,052
[SPEAKER_24]: The Friends of Chevalier Auditorium and Gene McJim, City of Medford, the Chevalier Theatre Organ Society, and the Chevalier Auditorium Commission, and the Canadian American Club of Massachusetts.

64
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:39,969
[SPEAKER_24]: On this Saturday evening, a special concert will be presented at Chevalier to celebrate the history and survival of this important landmark in Medford.

65
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:48,535
[SPEAKER_24]: It will feature the music and magic of the Baron MacNeil Ensemble, Canada's Celtic ambassadors.

66
00:06:49,696 --> 00:06:54,060
[SPEAKER_24]: Their performances include superb expertise of many instruments,

67
00:06:55,058 --> 00:06:58,702
[SPEAKER_24]: beautiful singing in harmony, and step dancing.

68
00:07:00,123 --> 00:07:06,930
[SPEAKER_24]: This talented musical family has been on tour extensively in Canada and on the international circuit.

69
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:18,902
[SPEAKER_24]: There will also be local talent in the concert, when students of the Jackie O'Reilly School of Dance will perform step dancing with Barbara McNeils.

70
00:07:20,981 --> 00:07:24,203
[SPEAKER_24]: The doors will open for patrons at 6 p.m.

71
00:07:25,204 --> 00:07:38,193
[SPEAKER_24]: to enjoy concessions with cash bars serving the famous Medford rum and South Boston Irish whiskey by our major sponsor, Grand 10 Distilling.

72
00:07:39,934 --> 00:07:45,138
[SPEAKER_24]: Wine, beer, and non-alcoholic beverages will also be available until showtime at 7 p.m.

73
00:07:47,590 --> 00:08:16,707
[SPEAKER_24]: This celebration could not happen without the generous support of the community, especially our sponsors, Grand Tent Distilling, Remax Realty Services, Members Plus Credit Union, Wynn Resorts Everett, Prioto Lane & Associates, and the Medford Arts Council, and all the businesses, groups, and individuals that purchased advertisements in the program book.

74
00:08:18,994 --> 00:08:24,898
[SPEAKER_24]: We're most grateful to everyone who has made this event possible, especially to all the volunteers.

75
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,562
[SPEAKER_24]: I invite the community to join in this celebration by coming to the concert.

76
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:44,771
[SPEAKER_24]: Tickets can be purchased online at www.chevaliertheatre.com or at Medford Electronics, 25 Salem Street.

77
00:08:46,473 --> 00:08:54,337
[SPEAKER_24]: Tickets are reasonably priced at $26 and $19 for students and seniors over 60.

78
00:08:55,778 --> 00:09:04,763
[SPEAKER_24]: If you're planning to dine out before the show, local restaurants are offering discounts when you show your theater ticket.

79
00:09:05,624 --> 00:09:14,669
[SPEAKER_24]: That will be at Carol's Restaurant, Snappy Patty, Ninja All-You-Can-Eat Sushi, and Salvatore's Restaurant.

80
00:09:15,843 --> 00:09:27,848
[SPEAKER_24]: This will be a great evening of entertainment, so we hope you will join in this one-time milestone for this great asset here in our city.

81
00:09:29,409 --> 00:09:30,149
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much.

82
00:09:40,293 --> 00:09:40,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, May.

83
00:09:40,773 --> 00:09:44,575
[SPEAKER_11]: If I could, Ken Krause, 50 Mystic Street, also a member of the committee.

84
00:09:45,026 --> 00:09:45,606
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be brief.

85
00:09:45,827 --> 00:09:55,154
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I was researching an article about the 40th, uh, the 75th anniversary of the, and, uh, the dedication and actually researching the actual dedication ceremony.

86
00:09:55,634 --> 00:09:59,577
[SPEAKER_11]: And in my research, I was reading the Medford high school yearbook of 1940.

87
00:09:59,717 --> 00:10:11,866
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, I was struck by a paragraph that was written by the three members of the senior class, um, about the year, uh, actually their career at Medford high.

88
00:10:12,086 --> 00:10:14,468
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, in particular, the, um,

89
00:10:15,413 --> 00:10:17,254
[SPEAKER_11]: opening of the new auditorium and gym.

90
00:10:17,295 --> 00:10:19,696
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'd just like to read you that real quickly.

91
00:10:20,637 --> 00:10:31,725
[SPEAKER_11]: It says, if you have ever moved into a new home shining and bright, you will understand our elation as we learn that the latest addition to our school is ready for occupancy.

92
00:10:32,706 --> 00:10:44,375
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, there are the usual classrooms, but the selections of the building which draw our attention are the completely equipped gymnasium and the magnificent auditorium.

93
00:10:45,972 --> 00:10:52,298
[SPEAKER_11]: How proud we are to be the first class to hold our commencement exercises in that hall.

94
00:10:53,679 --> 00:11:03,768
[SPEAKER_11]: I have often wondered if the citizens of Medford realize how appreciative we are of their efforts.

95
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:10,575
[SPEAKER_11]: At any rate, we feel sure that the sacrifice has not been made in vain.

96
00:11:11,621 --> 00:11:17,263
[SPEAKER_11]: as testified by the goodly number of students with high scholastic standing."

97
00:11:18,564 --> 00:11:26,506
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just really moved by how profound that sentiment was by three 17 or 18-year-old students who wrote that.

98
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:33,169
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it just made me mindful of how appreciative we need to remain to be

99
00:11:34,324 --> 00:11:49,435
[SPEAKER_11]: of those people 75 years ago that got this auditorium built and also of the citizens 35 years ago that made sure that it was preserved as an auditorium when it was this close to being converted into condos.

100
00:11:50,096 --> 00:11:59,323
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just wanted to share that and encourage people to come to the theater if you've never been there or if it's been a long time since you've been there.

101
00:12:00,102 --> 00:12:08,390
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm sure you'll enjoy the concert, and I'm sure you'll come away with an appreciation for this gem of a facility that we have in Medford.

102
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:09,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

103
00:12:09,991 --> 00:12:10,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Ken.

104
00:12:12,134 --> 00:12:13,775
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd just like to add one thing.

105
00:12:14,256 --> 00:12:17,398
[SPEAKER_12]: Cindy Watson, 65 Valley Street, Medford.

106
00:12:17,619 --> 00:12:18,700
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm going to speak from the heart.

107
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,801
[SPEAKER_12]: As Ken said,

108
00:12:21,343 --> 00:12:22,624
[SPEAKER_12]: Chevalier is a hidden gem.

109
00:12:23,105 --> 00:12:25,506
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been to this podium a long time now.

110
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,548
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a 75-year anniversary.

111
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:32,011
[SPEAKER_12]: And if people don't get it, there's something wrong.

112
00:12:32,191 --> 00:12:33,932
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the sixth largest theater in New England.

113
00:12:35,073 --> 00:12:36,614
[SPEAKER_12]: It's huge for Medford.

114
00:12:36,995 --> 00:12:38,315
[SPEAKER_12]: We generate a lot of revenue.

115
00:12:39,316 --> 00:12:43,159
[SPEAKER_12]: And one of the things, too, that we really... We've been working on this since November.

116
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:47,502
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the things we thought it might be a nice prelude to St.

117
00:12:47,542 --> 00:12:48,763
[SPEAKER_12]: Patrick's Day for

118
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:52,451
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, I'm Irish, but for those, you know, everybody celebrates St.

119
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:53,052
[SPEAKER_12]: Patrick's Day.

120
00:12:53,632 --> 00:12:54,673
[SPEAKER_12]: So please come.

121
00:12:54,873 --> 00:12:56,454
[SPEAKER_12]: The tickets are reasonably priced.

122
00:12:57,795 --> 00:13:02,098
[SPEAKER_12]: We want people to be there, and people have worked diligently.

123
00:13:02,238 --> 00:13:07,561
[SPEAKER_12]: So particularly the city councilors, we're asking you to really market this event.

124
00:13:07,902 --> 00:13:08,882
[SPEAKER_12]: We're on the countdown.

125
00:13:09,723 --> 00:13:12,064
[SPEAKER_12]: Saturday is around the corner, all right?

126
00:13:12,345 --> 00:13:18,048
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we can't dazzle you with our brilliance, we'll baffle you with our blarney, okay?

127
00:13:18,349 --> 00:13:18,569
[SPEAKER_12]: Come.

128
00:13:19,385 --> 00:13:19,845
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

129
00:13:21,746 --> 00:13:22,807
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

130
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,268
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, briefly, Counselor Marks.

131
00:13:26,328 --> 00:13:26,688
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

132
00:13:33,372 --> 00:13:34,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

133
00:13:34,352 --> 00:13:35,232
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll be brief.

134
00:13:35,292 --> 00:13:38,094
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to thank the friends of Chevalier.

135
00:13:39,654 --> 00:13:43,336
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually am a recent board member of Chevalier.

136
00:13:43,516 --> 00:13:47,358
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can tell you firsthand the amount of time and effort

137
00:13:47,719 --> 00:14:16,090
[SPEAKER_06]: that all these volunteers give to that organization, and to Chevalier, and to the fact that they've been working on this for the past four or five months to bring the Barry McNeils into the City of Method to have a great Celtic performance in this community, and also have it a night which people can go down and enjoy the fine dining in the square, enjoy the entertainment, and really bring some vibrance back into the square,

138
00:14:17,301 --> 00:14:25,043
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's largely in part of the friends of Chevalier who keep the funding in to support that magnificent building.

139
00:14:25,443 --> 00:14:27,443
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just want to personally thank them, Mr. President.

140
00:14:28,023 --> 00:14:29,104
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

141
00:14:29,184 --> 00:14:33,825
[SPEAKER_16]: And on the motion of Councilor Marks that this paper be received and placed on file.

142
00:14:34,205 --> 00:14:34,985
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

143
00:14:35,105 --> 00:14:35,685
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

144
00:14:36,205 --> 00:14:36,965
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion passes.

145
00:14:36,985 --> 00:14:41,066
[SPEAKER_16]: 15-087 petition for common vigilance license by

146
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:51,462
[SPEAKER_16]: Angelo Federico, president for Associazione Amici, Incorporated, 21 Reardon Road, Medford, Mass.

147
00:14:52,082 --> 00:14:53,503
[SPEAKER_16]: Sir, your name and address for the record.

148
00:14:54,183 --> 00:14:55,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening, Mr. President, members of the council.

149
00:14:56,304 --> 00:15:01,846
[SPEAKER_09]: John Guarnara, 130 South Street, Medford, representing the petitioner, Association Amici, Incorporated.

150
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:11,009
[SPEAKER_09]: By way of background, ladies and gentlemen, the organization is a very small cultural and social club, which is a nonprofit.

151
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:13,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Its club facilities are located at 21 Reardon Road,

152
00:15:15,387 --> 00:15:29,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Redden Road, I found out after they contacted me, runs off Mystic Avenue between the Portland Group, which is a plumbing supply house, and the Nissan car group.

153
00:15:29,817 --> 00:15:32,899
[SPEAKER_09]: So you've probably gone by it a million times and never realized it was there.

154
00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:37,622
[SPEAKER_09]: It's located in an industrial area on an unaccepted street.

155
00:15:38,223 --> 00:15:40,584
[SPEAKER_09]: There are two or three businesses in there currently.

156
00:15:41,725 --> 00:15:44,387
[SPEAKER_09]: The organization inhabits a boat.

157
00:15:45,671 --> 00:15:48,412
[SPEAKER_09]: 1,200 to 1,300 square feet, which was a build-out for them.

158
00:15:49,053 --> 00:15:53,235
[SPEAKER_09]: As I indicated, they are very small in size, less than 100 members.

159
00:15:54,115 --> 00:15:58,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Their primary function, actually, from what I understand, is that's a dining club.

160
00:15:58,897 --> 00:16:03,559
[SPEAKER_09]: And once a month, the members will get together, a group will cook, and they'll enjoy an evening.

161
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,241
[SPEAKER_09]: And that basically comprises the extent of their social activities.

162
00:16:09,061 --> 00:16:11,563
[SPEAKER_09]: At some point, we will be seeking a liquor license.

163
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:14,844
[SPEAKER_09]: And at that time, I'll come back before you to extend the hours.

164
00:16:15,243 --> 00:16:17,204
[SPEAKER_09]: beyond that of a common patrol's license.

165
00:16:17,965 --> 00:16:21,627
[SPEAKER_09]: I have three members of the board of directors and officers with me this evening.

166
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:24,909
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have any questions, I'll be more than happy to answer them for you.

167
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:26,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

168
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Counselor Camuso.

169
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:28,811
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President.

170
00:16:28,911 --> 00:16:43,399
[SPEAKER_25]: Just before I make a few comments and just in the interest of full disclosure, not only the attorney representing the clients this evening is a friend, but also my former employer for about two and a half months, about four years ago in 2010.

171
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:49,981
[SPEAKER_25]: November to roughly January of 2015 in the interest of full disclosure.

172
00:16:50,562 --> 00:16:53,804
[SPEAKER_25]: And if I may, I think this is a real good organization.

173
00:16:53,864 --> 00:16:55,945
[SPEAKER_25]: It's going to add to the diversity of our community.

174
00:16:57,646 --> 00:17:07,212
[SPEAKER_25]: The gentlemen that are on the board certainly have been very enthusiastic about this over the past few years leading up to this great endeavor.

175
00:17:07,312 --> 00:17:09,294
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's before us this evening.

176
00:17:09,774 --> 00:17:12,436
[SPEAKER_25]: And this is something that I support wholeheartedly.

177
00:17:12,936 --> 00:17:13,236
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

178
00:17:13,776 --> 00:17:14,597
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Consular.

179
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Caviello, Chairman of the Licensing.

180
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:18,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

181
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:22,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I have reviewed the papers and I have found everything in order.

182
00:17:23,332 --> 00:17:25,934
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had the opportunity to speak with some of the members of the club.

183
00:17:26,074 --> 00:17:37,681
[SPEAKER_03]: I've gone down there and toured the club and they've expressed their intent to get involved in the community, but with maybe some scholarships and be a real community organization.

184
00:17:37,721 --> 00:17:40,023
[SPEAKER_03]: So I welcome them to the community.

185
00:17:40,483 --> 00:17:41,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor.

186
00:17:41,544 --> 00:17:42,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Caviello.

187
00:17:42,965 --> 00:17:43,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Pinto.

188
00:17:44,247 --> 00:17:45,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Two questions, John.

189
00:17:45,068 --> 00:17:47,069
[SPEAKER_08]: The first one is, you said there's about a hundred members?

190
00:17:47,889 --> 00:17:49,831
[SPEAKER_09]: About a hundred members?

191
00:17:49,871 --> 00:17:56,635
[SPEAKER_09]: There were 50 charter members, Councillor, and I believe now there are approximately 30 associate members, but well under a hundred.

192
00:17:57,856 --> 00:18:01,758
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're going to have this get together once a month for this dinner or whatever it might be?

193
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:05,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Their main function will be a meeting and a dinner meeting once a month.

194
00:18:06,081 --> 00:18:07,822
[SPEAKER_08]: The question I would have, where are they going to park their cars?

195
00:18:08,702 --> 00:18:10,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Where are they going to park their cars?

196
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:12,745
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they going to infringe upon the neighborhood?

197
00:18:14,225 --> 00:18:21,289
[SPEAKER_09]: On a Friday evening, the road is such that there'd be a very adequate space to park cars.

198
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:29,094
[SPEAKER_09]: There is one business in the area that is a dance studio that fronts on the parkway.

199
00:18:29,634 --> 00:18:36,138
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a metal fabrication business that's open regular normal business hours.

200
00:18:36,739 --> 00:18:41,021
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the other end, there is an electrical contractor who holds business hours.

201
00:18:42,528 --> 00:18:53,675
[SPEAKER_09]: The road itself, which I indicated is non-accepted, provides a very vast area for parking at non-business hours, which would be typically the hours that members would be at this particular organization.

202
00:18:54,976 --> 00:18:58,418
[SPEAKER_08]: And is this a reintroduction of the old Italian club that used to be on Up and South?

203
00:18:58,438 --> 00:18:58,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Pardon me?

204
00:18:58,918 --> 00:19:02,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this a reintroduction of the Italian club that used to be up on South Method?

205
00:19:03,401 --> 00:19:04,161
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not at all.

206
00:19:04,902 --> 00:19:06,042
[SPEAKER_09]: It's quite separate and distinct.

207
00:19:06,082 --> 00:19:06,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor?

208
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:10,705
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Penta.

209
00:19:12,566 --> 00:19:16,608
[SPEAKER_16]: Lungo Kern on the motion of approval by Councilor Caviello, Councilor Lungo Kern.

210
00:19:16,768 --> 00:19:18,129
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, President De La Russo.

211
00:19:18,149 --> 00:19:22,071
[SPEAKER_27]: If you can enlighten us, what else is involved in the membership?

212
00:19:22,511 --> 00:19:23,132
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sorry, Councilor.

213
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:24,873
[SPEAKER_27]: What else is involved in the membership?

214
00:19:25,273 --> 00:19:26,394
[SPEAKER_27]: Why are they a non-for-profit?

215
00:19:29,515 --> 00:19:38,160
[SPEAKER_09]: They receive non-profit status from the Internal Revenue Service after filing as a non-profit with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

216
00:19:38,896 --> 00:19:50,926
[SPEAKER_09]: And as you well know, Councilor, filing your article of organization with the internal revenue after about a 10-month period of time, if they deem you qualified, they will give you a non-profit status.

217
00:19:51,466 --> 00:19:54,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody has a pecuniary interest in the club.

218
00:19:54,709 --> 00:19:58,412
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no profit to be made by any one individual in the club.

219
00:19:59,193 --> 00:20:04,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Any monies that are generated will be used for charitable purposes.

220
00:20:05,498 --> 00:20:05,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

221
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:08,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

222
00:20:08,585 --> 00:20:09,925
[SPEAKER_08]: If that is all council Penta.

223
00:20:09,985 --> 00:20:25,329
[SPEAKER_08]: And one last thing, John, uh, on your page that you have coming back from the department of revenue and the letter of compliance, I'm sorry, on the letter that came back from the department of revenue that was submitted, the indicate you have no withholding, no sales and no room occupancy.

224
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:25,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

225
00:20:25,949 --> 00:20:31,370
[SPEAKER_09]: You have, you have the, you have the, uh, copy from the IRS and revenue.

226
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,791
[SPEAKER_09]: I filed it with my papers.

227
00:20:32,991 --> 00:20:33,171
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

228
00:20:33,551 --> 00:20:33,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

229
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:34,831
[SPEAKER_08]: But in that pipe that you filed,

230
00:20:35,658 --> 00:20:39,480
[SPEAKER_08]: you're not being responsible for withholding sales in room and room.

231
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,281
[SPEAKER_09]: There are no employees.

232
00:20:40,301 --> 00:20:46,065
[SPEAKER_08]: But what are you going to do if, in fact, in the future you said you folks are going to be applying possibly for a liquor license?

233
00:20:46,405 --> 00:20:48,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, somebody has to pay for that.

234
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:49,987
[SPEAKER_08]: So are the members going to pay for that?

235
00:20:50,628 --> 00:20:56,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, as I indicated, 500 members put up $500 was put up by 50 charter members to generate a flow of cash.

236
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:07,390
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

237
00:21:07,931 --> 00:21:15,957
[SPEAKER_08]: If you were to get a liquor license from the City and your members go there for an event, are they going to charge for the alcohol that they are going to be serving?

238
00:21:16,097 --> 00:21:16,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

239
00:21:16,618 --> 00:21:16,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

240
00:21:17,058 --> 00:21:23,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Then you would have to come back and reapply for a sales tax provision as far as that part goes.

241
00:21:23,183 --> 00:21:28,647
[SPEAKER_09]: From what I understand, a nonprofit pays a tax once a year.

242
00:21:29,768 --> 00:21:31,470
[SPEAKER_09]: I know from other nonprofits that I have been involved

243
00:21:32,105 --> 00:21:36,066
[SPEAKER_09]: So they would pay once a year, but that would be up to their accounting.

244
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:41,148
[SPEAKER_09]: I would never presume to give accounting or tax advice to a client.

245
00:21:41,168 --> 00:21:41,908
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not qualified.

246
00:21:42,188 --> 00:21:53,151
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's my understanding that on the sale of alcohol, even in a nonprofit, they are required to pay a very small portion to the Commonwealth once a year.

247
00:21:53,731 --> 00:21:59,993
[SPEAKER_09]: If, in fact, there were a hall rental, and this facility is not of the size to be rented, they would be required to pay it once a month.

248
00:22:02,852 --> 00:22:03,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, yeah.

249
00:22:04,653 --> 00:22:06,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, if that's all, Councilor Matz?

250
00:22:07,355 --> 00:22:13,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, John, is the red, is that accessible by public safety vehicles?

251
00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:14,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

252
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it is, Councilor.

253
00:22:16,681 --> 00:22:16,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

254
00:22:17,241 --> 00:22:27,727
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the, I know we filed with both, as you're well aware, we filed with both the fire chief and with the police chief.

255
00:22:28,308 --> 00:22:31,790
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe they both signed off favorably on a petition.

256
00:22:32,498 --> 00:22:32,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

257
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:39,441
[SPEAKER_06]: And the, uh, the original charter, uh, where, where was the original location for this club?

258
00:22:40,201 --> 00:22:42,542
[SPEAKER_09]: This, this is, this is the original.

259
00:22:43,163 --> 00:22:44,643
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is, this is the original.

260
00:22:44,683 --> 00:22:44,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

261
00:22:45,404 --> 00:22:57,269
[SPEAKER_09]: The, the articles of organization were filed, I believe in, uh, March of, uh, 2014, uh, with the, um, uh, Commonwealth of Massachusetts secretary of state corporations.

262
00:22:57,569 --> 00:23:01,811
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a new group of people who got together and, uh, they filed a new corporation.

263
00:23:02,517 --> 00:23:11,782
[SPEAKER_09]: And they got their response back from the Internal Revenue Service, I believe in October of 2014, giving them non-profit status.

264
00:23:12,222 --> 00:23:15,404
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is a group, an original group in and of itself.

265
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:17,906
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a successor group of any other.

266
00:23:17,926 --> 00:23:31,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, the reason why I ask, and I'm not sure if Councilor Pinto was referring to that, is next to the old water and sewer building, the Italian American Club was there, as you probably are aware.

267
00:23:31,547 --> 00:23:33,287
[SPEAKER_06]: for many years until it burned down.

268
00:23:34,148 --> 00:23:43,470
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, many of the organization members were trying to relocate back in the city here because their original charter was a method charter.

269
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:57,593
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, I'm not sure if this organization, uh, if you have any affiliations with anyone from the Italian American club, but, um, I know there was a great interest to come back into the community.

270
00:23:58,054 --> 00:23:59,494
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know if maybe at some point,

271
00:24:00,633 --> 00:24:02,334
[SPEAKER_06]: There could be some discussions.

272
00:24:02,354 --> 00:24:10,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm sure, Councillor, if some of those members contacted the association or the club, they're more than happy to discuss that with them.

273
00:24:10,836 --> 00:24:21,700
[SPEAKER_09]: They say the quarters are not very large, and there are under 100 members currently, but I'm sure they'd be amenable to talking to anybody interested in joining.

274
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,000
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish them well.

275
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

276
00:24:23,961 --> 00:24:24,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

277
00:24:24,581 --> 00:24:24,981
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

278
00:24:25,021 --> 00:24:27,522
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Councillor Caviello for approval, all those in favour?

279
00:24:27,782 --> 00:24:28,602
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

280
00:24:29,256 --> 00:24:30,997
[SPEAKER_16]: Passes, congratulazione.

281
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,178
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President, members of the council.

282
00:24:34,198 --> 00:24:49,103
[SPEAKER_16]: 15-086, petition by Janelle Rocco, 17 Cobb Street, Medford, to address the city council about Medford overcoming addiction vigil, substance abuse community group.

283
00:24:49,783 --> 00:24:50,003
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

284
00:24:50,063 --> 00:24:53,164
[SPEAKER_16]: Rocco, please state your name and address for the record.

285
00:24:53,824 --> 00:24:56,085
[SPEAKER_21]: Janelle Rocco, 17 Cobb Street of Medford.

286
00:24:59,111 --> 00:25:00,252
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening, council members.

287
00:25:00,892 --> 00:25:01,952
[SPEAKER_21]: My name is Jean Rocco.

288
00:25:02,112 --> 00:25:03,833
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm a proud, lifelong Medford resident.

289
00:25:04,914 --> 00:25:08,636
[SPEAKER_21]: I attended Medford public schools all the way through my graduation from Medford High back in 2010.

290
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:15,579
[SPEAKER_21]: I have a lot of love for my city, so much that I recently started a community action group named Medford Overcoming Addiction.

291
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:21,122
[SPEAKER_21]: I started this group after I began researching what kinds of addiction resources and education Medford has to offer.

292
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,501
[SPEAKER_21]: To my disappointment, I found very little.

293
00:25:24,162 --> 00:25:30,208
[SPEAKER_21]: There is nothing posted on the city's website about substance abuse or who to call if you have any questions or concerns regarding this issue.

294
00:25:30,708 --> 00:25:35,693
[SPEAKER_21]: The site doesn't mention anything about Families Anonymous, a support group that has met weekly in Medford for many years.

295
00:25:38,092 --> 00:25:44,017
[SPEAKER_21]: This is important information for the public to know.

296
00:25:44,037 --> 00:25:46,659
[SPEAKER_21]: This information should be easily accessible for the community.

297
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:48,921
[SPEAKER_21]: To be honest, I wasn't entirely shocked by this.

298
00:25:49,181 --> 00:25:52,384
[SPEAKER_21]: I feel like when it comes to substance abuse, everything tends to be swept under the rug.

299
00:25:52,824 --> 00:25:54,605
[SPEAKER_21]: It's easier to ignore than to deal with the issue.

300
00:25:55,546 --> 00:25:57,507
[SPEAKER_21]: After researching, I decided I wanted some answers.

301
00:25:57,888 --> 00:26:02,871
[SPEAKER_21]: I sent a couple of emails to the mayor and then also to the same emails to the secretaries in his office.

302
00:26:03,332 --> 00:26:08,315
[SPEAKER_21]: I did get a response from Lisa Evangelista, who was very helpful and forwarded my email to Penny from Team Medford.

303
00:26:08,815 --> 00:26:10,677
[SPEAKER_21]: That is when I had my first meeting with Penny.

304
00:26:11,017 --> 00:26:18,362
[SPEAKER_21]: I told her all of my concerns and what I would like to do in Medford to help raise awareness, educate the masses, and break the stigma.

305
00:26:18,742 --> 00:26:23,926
[SPEAKER_21]: Our first event was a community meeting where over 30 people from Medford and the surrounding cities came to share their stories

306
00:26:24,256 --> 00:26:26,557
[SPEAKER_21]: and to find out what they can do to address the issue in Medford.

307
00:26:28,298 --> 00:26:31,579
[SPEAKER_21]: Many people in Medford have been affected by this disease, including myself.

308
00:26:32,219 --> 00:26:37,341
[SPEAKER_21]: It's everywhere, and it does not discriminate against age, gender, race, or income.

309
00:26:39,022 --> 00:26:40,002
[SPEAKER_21]: No one is exempt.

310
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:48,066
[SPEAKER_21]: Whether people choose to believe it or not, Medford does have a drug issue.

311
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:51,347
[SPEAKER_21]: It's time that it is brought into light, and we do something about it.

312
00:26:51,867 --> 00:26:53,728
[SPEAKER_21]: The entire community, city officials,

313
00:26:54,168 --> 00:26:57,070
[SPEAKER_21]: law enforcement and its members must work together on this issue.

314
00:26:57,891 --> 00:26:58,672
[SPEAKER_21]: We can do better.

315
00:26:59,132 --> 00:27:04,316
[SPEAKER_21]: We feel the first step in this battle is to heal those wounded hearts amongst us who've lost loved ones to addiction.

316
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:07,038
[SPEAKER_21]: We must say to them, your loved one mattered to this city.

317
00:27:07,499 --> 00:27:15,425
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm here today to invite you to a truly community-oriented candlelight vigil being held by Medford Overcoming Addiction in partnership with Team Medford.

318
00:27:16,145 --> 00:27:19,768
[SPEAKER_21]: The vigil will be held on Sunday, March 22nd from 5 to 7 p.m.

319
00:27:19,989 --> 00:27:21,149
[SPEAKER_21]: right here in these very chambers.

320
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,911
[SPEAKER_21]: We've been working very hard planning this event.

321
00:27:24,471 --> 00:27:32,293
[SPEAKER_21]: Prior to the vigil, we will be holding a nasal Narcan training and presentation for anyone in need of this life-saving drug.

322
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:37,674
[SPEAKER_21]: The vigil program will include, most importantly, the names of those lost to this disease of addiction.

323
00:27:37,794 --> 00:27:41,655
[SPEAKER_21]: We will also have some Medford residents that are living in long-term recovery share their stories.

324
00:27:42,175 --> 00:27:46,776
[SPEAKER_21]: Local resident and recovery-based poet Matthew Ganim will be sharing one of his hope-inspiring poems.

325
00:27:47,556 --> 00:27:50,237
[SPEAKER_21]: Families Anonymous will have two families from their group speaking as well.

326
00:27:51,442 --> 00:28:01,281
[SPEAKER_21]: Many people from the community have volunteered their time to help with this event, and we would like it if you could all attend the vigil in support of our community group, the Fight Against Addiction, and of those families who have lost a loved one to this disease.

327
00:28:05,765 --> 00:28:08,246
[SPEAKER_21]: With me here is Medford resident John Garrity.

328
00:28:08,666 --> 00:28:11,667
[SPEAKER_21]: John and his family have been tremendously affected by this disease.

329
00:28:12,068 --> 00:28:20,471
[SPEAKER_21]: This is a very difficult time for the Garrity family, for Thursday marks the one-year anniversary of the death of their son, Jay, who lost his life to this disease at the young age of 30.

330
00:28:20,651 --> 00:28:26,394
[SPEAKER_21]: I would like to take the time and express our condolences to John and the Garrity family.

331
00:28:27,094 --> 00:28:29,495
[SPEAKER_21]: John would also like to say a few brief words.

332
00:28:37,227 --> 00:28:39,349
[SPEAKER_02]: John Gavity, 61 Clifton street, Medford.

333
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:46,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the comments that Janelle made are profound and honest.

334
00:28:47,755 --> 00:28:57,362
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there is, uh, within this council, I see, you know, people that I know are good people, good counselors.

335
00:28:58,262 --> 00:29:00,864
[SPEAKER_02]: My family's been here for almost 150 years.

336
00:29:01,945 --> 00:29:03,626
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the politics of the town.

337
00:29:03,686 --> 00:29:05,007
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the people of the town.

338
00:29:06,068 --> 00:29:06,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh,

339
00:29:06,597 --> 00:29:12,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Frederick DelaRusso's a legacy is Frederick DelaRusso senior was here in the seventies.

340
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,480
[SPEAKER_02]: He served on this council.

341
00:29:14,061 --> 00:29:15,922
[SPEAKER_02]: He served admirably.

342
00:29:16,762 --> 00:29:18,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Robert Penta has been here 35 years.

343
00:29:19,763 --> 00:29:24,025
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember him when I was 15 years old, dedicated to the public.

344
00:29:24,826 --> 00:29:31,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a guy who he can show you the scars, uh, for the things he's fought for, for the city.

345
00:29:31,912 --> 00:29:33,794
[SPEAKER_02]: The Camuso family I know well.

346
00:29:33,874 --> 00:29:35,796
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good family, homegrown.

347
00:29:36,037 --> 00:29:37,478
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a star.

348
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:39,360
[SPEAKER_02]: His star's on the rise.

349
00:29:40,962 --> 00:29:43,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Marks and Mr. Calviello I don't know well.

350
00:29:43,545 --> 00:29:50,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Brianna Luongo I know has a very good reputation and is fighting for good things for the city.

351
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:59,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to mention some people from the other side, from the school committee.

352
00:29:59,524 --> 00:30:07,949
[SPEAKER_02]: School committee member George Scott Pelley is a dedicated guy, an honest, good person for the city, a mentor, a great coach.

353
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:13,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Robert Skerry, family's been here forever, another homegrown person.

354
00:30:14,034 --> 00:30:18,517
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is a lot of caring in the city, although it doesn't look like it.

355
00:30:19,354 --> 00:30:25,356
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason for that, I believe, is there are blind spots here.

356
00:30:26,477 --> 00:30:43,724
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we took the cemetery and the white stones that mark the graves of veterans, if we went up and said, okay, we're gonna put blue stones for the citizens who've died from heroin overdose, you'd be shocked.

357
00:30:44,464 --> 00:30:46,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Driving through there, you'd be horrified.

358
00:30:47,534 --> 00:30:51,456
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not because this council doesn't care.

359
00:30:51,836 --> 00:30:53,857
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not because Mayor McGlynn doesn't care.

360
00:30:53,937 --> 00:30:55,317
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a great leader also.

361
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:59,899
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a legacy, been here 25 years or whatever.

362
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:03,800
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that Chief Leo Sacco doesn't care.

363
00:31:04,721 --> 00:31:11,343
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a tremendous, you could not find a better chief of police if you search the entire nation, a more committed professional.

364
00:31:12,124 --> 00:31:15,145
[SPEAKER_02]: But what does happen is the deaths of these people

365
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:18,851
[SPEAKER_02]: are not communicated to you.

366
00:31:19,812 --> 00:31:20,653
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know.

367
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:26,797
[SPEAKER_02]: If we brought in crash dummies and piled up the bodies, you would be shocked.

368
00:31:27,277 --> 00:31:32,361
[SPEAKER_02]: How many of you know how many people, how many kids in the city have died in the last 18 months from heroin?

369
00:31:33,061 --> 00:31:33,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anybody know?

370
00:31:35,043 --> 00:31:38,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you haven't been told and you look callous.

371
00:31:39,386 --> 00:31:43,849
[SPEAKER_02]: What you need to know is that I've lost my son.

372
00:31:45,096 --> 00:31:48,317
[SPEAKER_02]: These people have lost people and we all vote.

373
00:31:48,997 --> 00:31:52,158
[SPEAKER_02]: We all know what's going on and we know what's not going on.

374
00:31:52,698 --> 00:31:54,878
[SPEAKER_02]: So it does have an impact on you eventually.

375
00:31:55,778 --> 00:31:58,279
[SPEAKER_02]: And believe me when I say this, I don't blame any of you.

376
00:31:58,519 --> 00:31:59,959
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that you don't know.

377
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:02,460
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a blind spot in the system.

378
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,560
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a blind spot with the police.

379
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,341
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a blind spot with the school committee.

380
00:32:06,361 --> 00:32:07,921
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a blind spot with you guys.

381
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:15,092
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are a lot of dead people in Medfit from this one drug.

382
00:32:16,133 --> 00:32:36,223
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to say to you that these are not, although heroin and drug abuse affects crime, it affects public health, it affects all of these things, what you don't realize today is that this is, there are functioning

383
00:32:37,493 --> 00:32:38,273
[SPEAKER_02]: heroin addicts.

384
00:32:38,313 --> 00:32:42,275
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a drug now that people function every day.

385
00:32:42,815 --> 00:32:48,797
[SPEAKER_02]: One of you could be a heroin addict, and the other people wouldn't know it, not for a long time.

386
00:32:49,477 --> 00:33:04,562
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a disease, I guess, that I take great umbrage with the word addiction, because that's used politically as a way to say your fault.

387
00:33:05,671 --> 00:33:11,633
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's really not that way, and it's done that way whether it's gambling or anything that they want to put on the individual.

388
00:33:12,173 --> 00:33:14,994
[SPEAKER_02]: These are not addicts, they are dependent.

389
00:33:15,654 --> 00:33:25,337
[SPEAKER_02]: People will say to you, I had a man say to me, I bought some balloons for my son's event, and he said to me, well, you know, he made a choice.

390
00:33:26,197 --> 00:33:31,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let me tell you, the choice that you make with heroin is the first one, okay?

391
00:33:32,479 --> 00:33:34,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Because what this drug does

392
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:48,661
[SPEAKER_02]: is it hijacks the part of your brain that you use to eat.

393
00:33:49,702 --> 00:33:51,523
[SPEAKER_02]: How long do you think you could go without eating?

394
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:54,945
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a just say, no, that's an addict.

395
00:33:55,205 --> 00:33:56,025
[SPEAKER_02]: He should stop.

396
00:33:56,105 --> 00:33:57,066
[SPEAKER_02]: He made choices.

397
00:33:57,566 --> 00:34:00,288
[SPEAKER_02]: And recently, I'm going to tell you about the word choice.

398
00:34:00,987 --> 00:34:05,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Recently, I walk my dog in the woods every day and there's a lot of community in there.

399
00:34:05,772 --> 00:34:17,603
[SPEAKER_02]: And recently I've heard things like when a police officer gets shot or the Ferguson situation comes up, people saying, well, that guy's not a hero.

400
00:34:17,683 --> 00:34:20,185
[SPEAKER_02]: He made a choice to be a police officer.

401
00:34:20,866 --> 00:34:21,967
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's his job.

402
00:34:22,067 --> 00:34:23,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Tough luck for him.

403
00:34:23,689 --> 00:34:26,011
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what happens when you start saying, well,

404
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:28,488
[SPEAKER_02]: He made a choice or she made a choice.

405
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:34,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Be very, very careful of the word choice because then we start to put it on everybody.

406
00:34:34,853 --> 00:34:50,064
[SPEAKER_02]: And as far as addiction as a word, if you look up the definition of addiction, and I don't mean this to be fresh or funny, but Mr. Penter could be an addict for politics.

407
00:34:51,025 --> 00:34:52,326
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been doing this a long time.

408
00:34:52,366 --> 00:34:54,468
[SPEAKER_02]: He keeps going back no matter how much he suffers.

409
00:34:55,485 --> 00:34:57,086
[SPEAKER_02]: And others could be.

410
00:34:58,527 --> 00:35:13,676
[SPEAKER_02]: But my point is that there needs to be a mechanism and a liaison, maybe another committee, where you are kept up to date and monitored how many deaths are happening from these drugs.

411
00:35:14,216 --> 00:35:18,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Because what you have is an epidemic, or what you have had is an epidemic.

412
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:23,602
[SPEAKER_02]: And I could make the argument, pretty convincingly, that

413
00:35:24,195 --> 00:35:25,655
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not victims of heroin.

414
00:35:26,215 --> 00:35:39,538
[SPEAKER_02]: They're victims of manslaughter at best, and at worst, premeditated murder, because these drugs are mixed with something that's going to kill them that they have no control over in a premeditated way.

415
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:53,241
[SPEAKER_02]: So what happens in Europe and Canada is they offer injections to addicts or dependent

416
00:35:54,550 --> 00:36:03,958
[SPEAKER_02]: drug users, and they come into a clinic and they get an injection of the heroin or whatever they were, you know, they use different types of morphine.

417
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:07,500
[SPEAKER_02]: But the point is it becomes controlled.

418
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:20,650
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you have an epidemic and you have bodies in the streets that you don't know about, and you have devastated families in your own community while you guys sit here and, you know, look at issues about water, sewers, and these kinds of things,

419
00:36:22,706 --> 00:36:35,493
[SPEAKER_02]: There has to be a mechanism to say, OK, we've got an epidemic, and we need to set up a way to get these addicts to stop buying street heroin.

420
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:42,677
[SPEAKER_02]: And whether you use that mechanism or some other, most of the remedies that are out there now have not worked.

421
00:36:43,317 --> 00:36:47,679
[SPEAKER_02]: But because you guys don't know, you simply don't know.

422
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,940
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how do you feel?

423
00:36:50,845 --> 00:36:54,947
[SPEAKER_02]: You have students, you have members of your community dead, families devastated.

424
00:36:55,527 --> 00:36:56,547
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I'm here.

425
00:36:57,468 --> 00:36:58,588
[SPEAKER_02]: And you don't even know.

426
00:36:58,848 --> 00:37:02,210
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel for you guys because I can see it on your faces.

427
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:05,991
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see the question mark saying, why don't we know?

428
00:37:06,651 --> 00:37:08,792
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not Chief Sackler's fault.

429
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:09,773
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not your fault.

430
00:37:10,293 --> 00:37:11,273
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the public's fault.

431
00:37:11,313 --> 00:37:15,915
[SPEAKER_02]: But these things have to be known.

432
00:37:16,155 --> 00:37:18,656
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that has to be monitored.

433
00:37:18,696 --> 00:37:20,117
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be reported.

434
00:37:20,497 --> 00:37:25,581
[SPEAKER_02]: And there has to be something in place to say, OK, we've got to save some of these people.

435
00:37:26,462 --> 00:37:32,486
[SPEAKER_02]: And the people that 50% of the heroin users inject heroin.

436
00:37:33,447 --> 00:37:39,272
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have a program in place for methadone, for example, that they drink.

437
00:37:40,153 --> 00:37:41,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it does no good.

438
00:37:42,054 --> 00:37:45,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you've injected heroin, there is nothing like this.

439
00:37:46,337 --> 00:37:46,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing.

440
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:47,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing.

441
00:37:47,979 --> 00:37:49,200
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like going back to the womb.

442
00:37:50,524 --> 00:37:52,325
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no other program that's going to help.

443
00:37:52,806 --> 00:37:56,388
[SPEAKER_02]: So what they've discovered in Europe and Canada, they have to inject them.

444
00:37:56,408 --> 00:37:59,771
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to fight heroin with heroin while you try to make them better.

445
00:38:00,331 --> 00:38:09,478
[SPEAKER_02]: But nobody can fight anything if the leaders of our community, and I know you guys are dedicated, I know you are, but you don't know how can you help.

446
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:12,400
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I feel about it.

447
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:19,085
[SPEAKER_02]: I have, you know, I found out I was speaking today, just last night, so forgive me for being unprepared.

448
00:38:19,827 --> 00:38:36,197
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm going to close, and I thank you so much for your time, with a simple maxim from addiction.

449
00:38:37,218 --> 00:38:40,360
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is, I'm not telling you it's going to be easy.

450
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:45,963
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you it's going to be worth it to your community.

451
00:38:46,723 --> 00:38:47,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

452
00:39:00,919 --> 00:39:16,152
[SPEAKER_18]: My name's Deborah Garrity, 61 Clifton Street, Medford, and Jay Garrity was my son, is my son, and he'll be gone for one year, in two days.

453
00:39:16,172 --> 00:39:26,922
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just want to ask you to please help us, because I don't want

454
00:39:28,054 --> 00:39:34,716
[SPEAKER_18]: any other parent to go through what my family has gone through.

455
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:42,759
[SPEAKER_18]: And his disease was just such a small part of who he was.

456
00:39:42,779 --> 00:39:46,840
[SPEAKER_18]: And he hated it.

457
00:39:48,021 --> 00:39:49,161
[SPEAKER_18]: He hated it.

458
00:39:50,541 --> 00:39:52,142
[SPEAKER_18]: And he would say to me, Mom,

459
00:39:53,664 --> 00:39:54,325
[SPEAKER_18]: I hate this.

460
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:57,007
[SPEAKER_18]: What am I going to do?

461
00:39:57,828 --> 00:39:59,870
[SPEAKER_18]: And he tried to do everything.

462
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:10,980
[SPEAKER_18]: And he was working in his program, and he was clean, and I'll never know why he relapsed.

463
00:40:12,241 --> 00:40:18,167
[SPEAKER_18]: But as my husband said, heroin is something that

464
00:40:20,431 --> 00:40:24,632
[SPEAKER_18]: Once you make that first choice, it's no longer a choice.

465
00:40:27,953 --> 00:40:48,960
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm here just to ask for your help so that other families don't feel the agony that if you've never lost a child, and I hope none of you ever have or ever will, it's unbearable.

466
00:40:51,373 --> 00:40:58,334
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm praying that no one, no mom ever has to again.

467
00:40:58,354 --> 00:41:00,855
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

468
00:41:08,616 --> 00:41:09,057
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi.

469
00:41:09,597 --> 00:41:10,597
[SPEAKER_20]: My name is Diane Butler.

470
00:41:10,657 --> 00:41:11,297
[SPEAKER_20]: I live in Medford.

471
00:41:11,317 --> 00:41:13,337
[SPEAKER_20]: And after that, I have to thank my parents.

472
00:41:14,898 --> 00:41:20,479
[SPEAKER_20]: I am the face of a mother whose son, who struggles with addiction,

473
00:41:21,827 --> 00:41:25,690
[SPEAKER_20]: And let me tell everybody, it is the worst thing in the world.

474
00:41:27,071 --> 00:41:29,812
[SPEAKER_20]: I have seen the highs of it, and I have seen the lows.

475
00:41:32,334 --> 00:41:35,376
[SPEAKER_20]: Recently, I was the top story my son was.

476
00:41:36,397 --> 00:41:37,878
[SPEAKER_20]: Addiction and crime go together.

477
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:41,720
[SPEAKER_20]: But I am the face of what it looks like.

478
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:44,002
[SPEAKER_20]: I have three great daughters.

479
00:41:44,022 --> 00:41:49,646
[SPEAKER_20]: I have a great husband, great foundation he had, great school, scholarship, lost it all.

480
00:41:51,432 --> 00:41:59,456
[SPEAKER_20]: Nobody knows what it's like when you have a son or a daughter who's addicted to drugs, what it's like to pray that you don't get that phone call that your son or daughter is dead.

481
00:42:00,697 --> 00:42:01,958
[SPEAKER_20]: Or from the police saying, you know what?

482
00:42:02,538 --> 00:42:04,799
[SPEAKER_20]: We picked him up because he committed a crime.

483
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,380
[SPEAKER_20]: And then you're reversed, too.

484
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,061
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank God he's alive.

485
00:42:08,501 --> 00:42:10,842
[SPEAKER_20]: And my condolences go to the Garrity family.

486
00:42:12,403 --> 00:42:20,728
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a stigma that goes along with it, the shame, the guilt, the sadness, the sleepless, many, many sleepless nights.

487
00:42:22,765 --> 00:42:26,727
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe we need to educate this, starting from the law enforcement.

488
00:42:27,107 --> 00:42:27,807
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm sorry.

489
00:42:28,347 --> 00:42:30,208
[SPEAKER_20]: I have been on both sides of the spectrum.

490
00:42:30,928 --> 00:42:33,469
[SPEAKER_20]: I've watched my son almost to the point where he was dead.

491
00:42:33,489 --> 00:42:36,131
[SPEAKER_20]: And there were times, dear God in heaven, where I said, you know what?

492
00:42:36,891 --> 00:42:38,712
[SPEAKER_20]: If this is the life he's going to live,

493
00:42:40,172 --> 00:42:40,713
[SPEAKER_20]: So be it.

494
00:42:42,433 --> 00:42:43,394
[SPEAKER_20]: Nobody knows.

495
00:42:43,774 --> 00:42:56,001
[SPEAKER_20]: We all sit up here, and if I was to bet nine out of ten of you know someone in your family who struggles with addiction or someone who is affected by this disease, it destroys everything in its path.

496
00:42:56,861 --> 00:43:00,103
[SPEAKER_20]: And we as a community need to come together and do something.

497
00:43:01,068 --> 00:43:06,553
[SPEAKER_20]: The junkie stigma, everything that goes along with it, it's not always the case.

498
00:43:07,234 --> 00:43:12,018
[SPEAKER_20]: There are families, brothers, sisters, mothers who sit back and pray.

499
00:43:12,399 --> 00:43:16,603
[SPEAKER_20]: And when I tell you, for me to sit up here, people say, you're so strong.

500
00:43:17,544 --> 00:43:19,686
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm strong because someone needs to be.

501
00:43:20,547 --> 00:43:21,427
[SPEAKER_20]: I love my son.

502
00:43:22,894 --> 00:43:24,395
[SPEAKER_20]: And I would do anything for him.

503
00:43:25,296 --> 00:43:29,639
[SPEAKER_20]: And if it means we as a community come together, then we need to.

504
00:43:30,219 --> 00:43:31,180
[SPEAKER_20]: If it's not, can.

505
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,782
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you know a firefighter said to me, we don't go to calls anymore.

506
00:43:34,982 --> 00:43:38,865
[SPEAKER_20]: The majority of our calls are due to, because the kid's overdosing.

507
00:43:40,086 --> 00:43:43,188
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm sure if we had this into play, we could save a life.

508
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:46,350
[SPEAKER_20]: It's true.

509
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:48,552
[SPEAKER_20]: We all have this blank stare on our face.

510
00:43:48,672 --> 00:43:51,294
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's like, you know, I could walk away

511
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:56,406
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just going to be that junkie's mother to many.

512
00:43:57,547 --> 00:43:59,908
[SPEAKER_20]: But I can tell you, I'm the lucky one.

513
00:43:59,948 --> 00:44:01,850
[SPEAKER_20]: He's alive right now, and I know where he is.

514
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:10,636
[SPEAKER_20]: And I will keep fighting, and I will keep fighting till every last breath that I have to make sure that someone, and I commend Janelle.

515
00:44:10,996 --> 00:44:14,479
[SPEAKER_20]: She's a 23-year-old young girl taking a stand to do this.

516
00:44:16,531 --> 00:44:17,531
[SPEAKER_20]: 23, and we're all sitting here.

517
00:44:17,591 --> 00:44:18,032
[SPEAKER_20]: Come on.

518
00:44:18,812 --> 00:44:20,352
[SPEAKER_20]: This is no secret to anybody.

519
00:44:21,472 --> 00:44:24,793
[SPEAKER_20]: We know about what's going on, and we need to come together.

520
00:44:25,173 --> 00:44:36,716
[SPEAKER_20]: We need to band together and do something, because I am tired of sitting back and watching not only myself, but my family just going through a living hell.

521
00:44:37,296 --> 00:44:38,036
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's what it is.

522
00:44:38,057 --> 00:44:39,797
[SPEAKER_20]: And there are success stories here, too.

523
00:44:39,917 --> 00:44:42,998
[SPEAKER_20]: So it can be done, but we need to work together on this.

524
00:44:43,398 --> 00:44:43,738
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

525
00:44:49,763 --> 00:44:53,905
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want to thank you all for listening to these stories and to what we all had to say tonight.

526
00:44:54,506 --> 00:44:56,867
[SPEAKER_22]: And I hope to see you all at the vigil on March 22nd.

527
00:44:56,907 --> 00:44:57,527
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

528
00:45:08,133 --> 00:45:09,214
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President.

529
00:45:09,314 --> 00:45:13,936
[SPEAKER_25]: And first of all, I want to applaud Janelle for really taking a leadership role on this.

530
00:45:17,178 --> 00:45:18,619
[SPEAKER_25]: As we all look around this community,

531
00:45:19,835 --> 00:45:20,996
[SPEAKER_25]: People are struggling out there.

532
00:45:21,036 --> 00:45:21,836
[SPEAKER_25]: People are in pain.

533
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:26,199
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, this is coming from someone that's an alcoholic in recovery.

534
00:45:26,819 --> 00:45:33,883
[SPEAKER_25]: I struggle every day not to pick up a drink so I can be a better father, a better husband, a better wife.

535
00:45:34,644 --> 00:45:48,272
[SPEAKER_25]: And I know the pain people are in, Mr. President, because at the end of my drinking, the choice was the booze and not the family and everything else out there that an average person

536
00:45:49,174 --> 00:45:51,075
[SPEAKER_25]: would realize and hit head on.

537
00:45:53,975 --> 00:45:57,396
[SPEAKER_25]: These people are out there, and they're using because they're in pain and they're suffering.

538
00:45:58,837 --> 00:45:59,717
[SPEAKER_25]: And this is a disease.

539
00:46:01,778 --> 00:46:05,339
[SPEAKER_25]: You put it in your system, you put it in your system, and it calls for another.

540
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:08,019
[SPEAKER_25]: And this is in my particular matter of alcoholism.

541
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:10,740
[SPEAKER_25]: It's not a normal person just having a drink.

542
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,801
[SPEAKER_25]: It calls for another and another and another and another.

543
00:46:13,741 --> 00:46:17,262
[SPEAKER_25]: And a few weeks ago, when I brought the task force commission forward,

544
00:46:18,064 --> 00:46:21,425
[SPEAKER_25]: for the city of Medford to actually get behind this and take a leadership role.

545
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:31,087
[SPEAKER_25]: Many people ask me why I was so upset with Mayor McGlynn over calling a press conference just to stump the council and to put it ahead of the council.

546
00:46:31,387 --> 00:46:34,228
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think you can all see why, why I was so upset.

547
00:46:35,048 --> 00:46:40,189
[SPEAKER_25]: Knowing what I go through on a daily basis when I try to do a meeting every single day when I don't have stuff going on.

548
00:46:41,129 --> 00:46:47,091
[SPEAKER_25]: I got people right now texting me that I consider my friends from my AA meetings right now.

549
00:46:48,425 --> 00:46:50,466
[SPEAKER_25]: telling me this takes a lot of guts to do this right now.

550
00:46:50,586 --> 00:46:51,287
[SPEAKER_25]: But you know what?

551
00:46:51,567 --> 00:46:53,628
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not proud of being an alcoholic.

552
00:46:53,668 --> 00:46:55,709
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm proud of being someone in recovery.

553
00:46:56,290 --> 00:46:57,270
[SPEAKER_25]: It's not what we chose.

554
00:46:58,071 --> 00:46:58,991
[SPEAKER_25]: It's not what we chose.

555
00:47:08,416 --> 00:47:14,200
[SPEAKER_25]: On any given day, too, I'm a firm believer this city does not want to look at the facts, like Mr. Garrity said.

556
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:21,552
[SPEAKER_25]: Go to any AA meeting around here, and it's full of Medford people, good Medford people, good Medford families.

557
00:47:23,533 --> 00:47:27,634
[SPEAKER_25]: Evidently they watch the city council because there's people texting me, as I said, just right now.

558
00:47:28,775 --> 00:47:33,517
[SPEAKER_25]: And I just think as a community, we really have to step up to the plate and be there.

559
00:47:33,877 --> 00:47:42,700
[SPEAKER_25]: Because as these folks know, and as I know, and as my family knows, no one's gonna make you stop using your substance of choice until you are ready.

560
00:47:43,857 --> 00:47:58,444
[SPEAKER_25]: And when you are ready and you surrender to this awful disease, we as a community have to be there with resources in place for the families, for the individuals that are looking to become part of recovery.

561
00:48:01,205 --> 00:48:03,366
[SPEAKER_25]: This is something we have to take a serious look at.

562
00:48:03,767 --> 00:48:09,949
[SPEAKER_25]: And you know, until I developed my problem with alcoholism over the past four or five years,

563
00:48:12,325 --> 00:48:14,986
[SPEAKER_25]: I never thought that marijuana was a gateway drug.

564
00:48:15,006 --> 00:48:16,227
[SPEAKER_25]: I used to hear that and laugh.

565
00:48:16,607 --> 00:48:17,008
[SPEAKER_25]: But you know what?

566
00:48:17,648 --> 00:48:19,369
[SPEAKER_25]: People are using just to numb their feelings.

567
00:48:20,649 --> 00:48:26,172
[SPEAKER_25]: And that's why, in recovery, they say, if you're an alcoholic, don't pick up the marijuana, or pick up this, or do that, or do that.

568
00:48:26,593 --> 00:48:34,617
[SPEAKER_25]: Or if you're an intravenous drug user and you stop doing that, don't pick up the Budweiser, because you're just substituting your problem.

569
00:48:36,398 --> 00:48:37,979
[SPEAKER_25]: These are the things no one wants to talk about.

570
00:48:38,739 --> 00:48:41,621
[SPEAKER_25]: But I got nine, 10 months left on this city council before I retire.

571
00:48:42,605 --> 00:48:57,882
[SPEAKER_25]: And this is something that I'm going to follow through on and make it my mission to have the city step up, have the city put funding behind this, not just press conferences, but actual places that families and substance abuse users can go to when they're ready.

572
00:48:57,902 --> 00:49:03,548
[SPEAKER_25]: Because no one's kidding anyone, until you are ready, until you are ready and surrender,

573
00:49:04,823 --> 00:49:21,713
[SPEAKER_25]: You can have anything in front of you, and all these families out here can relate, anything at all in front of you, and you're gonna choose the booze, the heroin, the pills, whatever it may be, you're gonna choose that, because ultimately it takes control of your life, takes control of your life.

574
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:32,679
[SPEAKER_25]: And I wouldn't have believed this until I confronted my disease, because it's awful easy to look outside and throw glasses and use the word junkie or a drunk,

575
00:49:34,087 --> 00:49:35,268
[SPEAKER_25]: I wrote my wife a nice letter.

576
00:49:35,908 --> 00:49:37,790
[SPEAKER_25]: You know what I always thought the alcoholic was, the drunk?

577
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:46,275
[SPEAKER_25]: The guy at Harvard Square sitting there with a brown paper bag, with a brown paper bag, drinking and collecting cans to go and buy the next bottle of booze.

578
00:49:47,196 --> 00:49:49,978
[SPEAKER_25]: I didn't think it was someone that was a city councilor for 16 years.

579
00:49:50,378 --> 00:49:53,960
[SPEAKER_25]: I didn't think it was someone that worked for the Sheriff's Department for 18 years.

580
00:49:55,161 --> 00:49:55,522
[SPEAKER_25]: You know what?

581
00:49:56,622 --> 00:49:57,663
[SPEAKER_25]: It doesn't discriminate.

582
00:49:58,725 --> 00:49:59,645
[SPEAKER_25]: does not discriminate.

583
00:49:59,685 --> 00:50:04,167
[SPEAKER_25]: We have members of this community that are suffering so much that end up killing themselves.

584
00:50:04,747 --> 00:50:06,748
[SPEAKER_25]: Killing themselves because they're in so much pain.

585
00:50:07,788 --> 00:50:08,709
[SPEAKER_25]: Pick up the obituaries.

586
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:12,210
[SPEAKER_25]: Not everyone says alcoholism or drug abuse or this or that.

587
00:50:14,371 --> 00:50:17,972
[SPEAKER_25]: But we know people that have committed suicide and were struggling with this very disease.

588
00:50:18,292 --> 00:50:22,553
[SPEAKER_25]: And they took that route rather than letting everyone else down.

589
00:50:22,814 --> 00:50:23,714
[SPEAKER_25]: Because when you're in a state

590
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:29,823
[SPEAKER_25]: and you feel like your disease got you by the grip, guess what?

591
00:50:30,583 --> 00:50:31,444
[SPEAKER_25]: You'd rather be dead.

592
00:50:32,465 --> 00:50:33,366
[SPEAKER_25]: You'd rather be dead.

593
00:50:33,766 --> 00:50:35,067
[SPEAKER_25]: And I'm speaking from experience.

594
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:39,311
[SPEAKER_25]: So we have to do something as a community.

595
00:50:40,012 --> 00:50:43,434
[SPEAKER_25]: We have to actually get out there and fund some programs.

596
00:50:43,855 --> 00:50:48,199
[SPEAKER_25]: Because like I said, when the substance abuse users are ready,

597
00:50:49,127 --> 00:50:51,849
[SPEAKER_25]: We have to be there to meet them with open arms and give them guidance.

598
00:50:51,889 --> 00:50:55,871
[SPEAKER_25]: Right now, the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous, the 12th step is giving back.

599
00:50:56,251 --> 00:50:56,932
[SPEAKER_25]: It's giving back.

600
00:50:57,652 --> 00:51:06,137
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm working with other people, other people that are alcoholics, to try to give them hope, you know?

601
00:51:07,158 --> 00:51:15,063
[SPEAKER_25]: And I just hope, I just hope that the city administration takes a long look at this and look that since 2003, 2003, in this community, people were overdosing,

602
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,761
[SPEAKER_25]: on heroin, overdosing.

603
00:51:21,101 --> 00:51:28,906
[SPEAKER_25]: A baseball player for the Florida Marlins overdosed within the seven and a half miles of this community several times, several times.

604
00:51:29,266 --> 00:51:30,547
[SPEAKER_25]: And that was in 2000, early 2000.

605
00:51:31,007 --> 00:51:32,829
[SPEAKER_25]: And here we are today.

606
00:51:33,709 --> 00:51:42,434
[SPEAKER_25]: So, uh, like I said, let's actually put our money where our mouths are and fund this something.

607
00:51:42,534 --> 00:51:48,278
[SPEAKER_25]: And I know councilor DelaRusso called me today cause he knows I've been on his back about calling a committee of the whole meeting on this particular matter.

608
00:51:48,807 --> 00:51:54,452
[SPEAKER_25]: And I don't know if you chose the date yet, but I thank you for being very active on this.

609
00:51:55,292 --> 00:51:56,033
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor.

610
00:52:02,898 --> 00:52:06,741
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor, thank you for sharing your experience, strength, and hope with us.

611
00:52:08,503 --> 00:52:10,224
[SPEAKER_25]: And that's what I hope.

612
00:52:11,085 --> 00:52:11,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Caravaglio.

613
00:52:12,226 --> 00:52:13,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

614
00:52:13,407 --> 00:52:17,270
[SPEAKER_03]: I commend the Garrity family and the Butler family for having the courage to come up here this evening

615
00:52:18,027 --> 00:52:22,549
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're right, people don't know what you go through unless they have it in their own family.

616
00:52:23,149 --> 00:52:27,650
[SPEAKER_03]: I've lost three members of my immediate family to the same type of thing.

617
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:32,752
[SPEAKER_03]: And just this weekend, a high school classmate, 61 years old, passed away.

618
00:52:32,772 --> 00:52:38,654
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, not a child, 61, passed away from drugs.

619
00:52:41,455 --> 00:52:42,976
[SPEAKER_03]: There's multiple forms of addiction.

620
00:52:42,996 --> 00:52:43,756
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just heroin.

621
00:52:43,796 --> 00:52:46,037
[SPEAKER_03]: It's prescription drugs, alcohol.

622
00:52:47,001 --> 00:53:05,887
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's say I commend my colleague here for wanting to step forward and actually do something that meaningful, not just have a committee, just a bunch of people talking, but coming out there with professional people that actually know what they're talking about, and possibly helping a lot of these people.

623
00:53:06,407 --> 00:53:10,448
[SPEAKER_03]: And people say to me all the time, you have good kids.

624
00:53:12,409 --> 00:53:13,549
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, there is no formula.

625
00:53:14,333 --> 00:53:15,033
[SPEAKER_03]: for having good kids.

626
00:53:15,073 --> 00:53:16,614
[SPEAKER_03]: It's strictly luck.

627
00:53:17,275 --> 00:53:21,177
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you see those people from good families that suffer from these addictions.

628
00:53:21,237 --> 00:53:29,181
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope that this group can come together unilaterally and do something for these families in the city of Medford.

629
00:53:29,301 --> 00:53:31,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we're not blind.

630
00:53:32,423 --> 00:53:33,583
[SPEAKER_03]: We do know what's going on.

631
00:53:35,504 --> 00:53:36,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

632
00:53:36,665 --> 00:53:37,285
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Counselor.

633
00:53:40,307 --> 00:53:40,887
[SPEAKER_15]: Counselor Knight.

634
00:53:41,467 --> 00:53:42,688
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

635
00:53:44,545 --> 00:53:47,687
[SPEAKER_15]: First of all, I'd like to thank the Garrity's and Ms.

636
00:53:47,707 --> 00:53:50,788
[SPEAKER_15]: Butler, and I'd like to let you know that you're going to make it through this.

637
00:53:51,288 --> 00:53:56,170
[SPEAKER_15]: And the reason you're going to make it through this is because you have people like Janelle Rocco, who are here to help you.

638
00:54:01,012 --> 00:54:03,533
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's a reciprocal relationship.

639
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:09,056
[SPEAKER_15]: Janelle, you're going to make it too, because you have people like the Garrity's and the Butler's that are here to help you.

640
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:14,038
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think that we as a city government need to take a look at the way that we are approaching

641
00:54:14,738 --> 00:54:17,043
[SPEAKER_15]: addiction addiction recovery and

642
00:54:17,803 --> 00:54:23,508
[SPEAKER_15]: The punitive approaches that we take, I don't think we're looking at this as a public health crisis.

643
00:54:23,608 --> 00:54:25,409
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we're looking at it as a public safety crisis.

644
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:37,459
[SPEAKER_15]: And until we really change our focus and our efforts on treating addiction as a disease and not as a public safety issue, we're going to see a lot of the same problems repeat themselves over and over and over again, Mr. President.

645
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:45,225
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that we've had a lot of discussion about addiction here in this council, and it's something that's very close to a number of us.

646
00:54:46,263 --> 00:55:01,338
[SPEAKER_15]: And one of the things I'd like to see is Medford Overcoming Addiction be invited to our Committee of the Whole meeting to provide us with some input and insight and maybe a little bit of direction as to what they see working in other communities and other places.

647
00:55:02,038 --> 00:55:06,923
[SPEAKER_15]: And more importantly, Mr. President, to identify the voids that we have here in Medford.

648
00:55:07,623 --> 00:55:17,447
[SPEAKER_15]: And to come up with an action plan to fill these voids so that in the future, families don't feel like they're left alone, that they're out there hanging around on a vine by themselves, Mr. President.

649
00:55:17,467 --> 00:55:29,191
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd like to move that this Committee of the Whole meeting be set up as soon as possible, and that Medford Overcoming Addiction be invited, Mr. President, to share their stories and to share their successes and to point us in the right direction.

650
00:55:29,531 --> 00:55:30,191
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Counselor.

651
00:55:30,211 --> 00:55:35,293
[SPEAKER_16]: And just so you're aware, what Counselor Camuso and I have been talking about is trying to

652
00:55:35,867 --> 00:55:42,429
[SPEAKER_16]: The resolution was so broad in the scope of people that were requested to be part of this.

653
00:55:42,869 --> 00:55:56,474
[SPEAKER_16]: We're trying to work with that broadness to contact people and then set up a date that's mutually convenient within the realization that this is a matter of urgency.

654
00:55:57,094 --> 00:55:59,374
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for your recommendation, Councilor.

655
00:55:59,394 --> 00:56:00,275
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Lococo.

656
00:56:00,455 --> 00:56:00,735
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

657
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:06,641
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, President De La Russo.

658
00:56:06,681 --> 00:56:18,746
[SPEAKER_27]: I, too, want to just thank Janelle for coming and having the courage to come forward and, I think, fight for a real lot of people, whether it's families, those who are suffering.

659
00:56:19,706 --> 00:56:21,307
[SPEAKER_27]: What you're doing is huge.

660
00:56:21,327 --> 00:56:24,909
[SPEAKER_27]: The power of a story can move somebody, can touch somebody.

661
00:56:24,949 --> 00:56:28,110
[SPEAKER_27]: And you did it in front of all these people and people watching from home.

662
00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:33,953
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. Garrity lit a fire under our butts, to say the least.

663
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:39,398
[SPEAKER_27]: It's courageous for Mrs. Garrity and Mrs. Butler to come forward, and I thank you.

664
00:56:40,139 --> 00:56:48,624
[SPEAKER_27]: This council has been talking about it, and we haven't been talking about it for long enough, but the last few months, it seems like it's a crisis.

665
00:56:48,644 --> 00:56:49,484
[SPEAKER_27]: It's an epidemic.

666
00:56:49,544 --> 00:56:50,525
[SPEAKER_27]: It's across the state.

667
00:56:51,025 --> 00:56:52,266
[SPEAKER_27]: It's what was mentioned before.

668
00:56:52,386 --> 00:57:01,032
[SPEAKER_27]: Something that's in this heroin is killing people, and it's breaking my heart, obviously.

669
00:57:01,572 --> 00:57:02,893
[SPEAKER_27]: I hear of somebody, like I said,

670
00:57:03,263 --> 00:57:08,047
[SPEAKER_27]: I think last week or the week before, almost every week you hear of somebody passing away.

671
00:57:08,067 --> 00:57:11,249
[SPEAKER_27]: And we need to do something.

672
00:57:11,289 --> 00:57:13,591
[SPEAKER_27]: I agree with what my council colleagues have said.

673
00:57:14,052 --> 00:57:16,554
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, we discussed a task force.

674
00:57:16,594 --> 00:57:18,135
[SPEAKER_27]: We discussed committee meetings.

675
00:57:18,195 --> 00:57:19,736
[SPEAKER_27]: We've asked the mayor for help.

676
00:57:20,236 --> 00:57:27,022
[SPEAKER_27]: We really do need to move forward on this and be proactive and get something done, get help for people.

677
00:57:28,363 --> 00:57:29,764
[SPEAKER_27]: And the biggest thing Janelle said,

678
00:57:30,232 --> 00:57:31,733
[SPEAKER_27]: is awareness, raise awareness.

679
00:57:31,813 --> 00:57:33,915
[SPEAKER_27]: Just coming here tonight, you're raising awareness.

680
00:57:34,675 --> 00:57:45,483
[SPEAKER_27]: We've talked about it four or five times in the last few months, and we're doing our part, but to have actual stories, the awareness level just rises that much higher.

681
00:57:45,603 --> 00:57:53,328
[SPEAKER_27]: And like you said, Councilor Camuso, if you can save one person from each time we speak on this, or help one family, it's worth it.

682
00:57:53,689 --> 00:57:59,553
[SPEAKER_27]: And I hope that Mayor McGlynn does get behind this on a compassionate and sincere level

683
00:58:00,098 --> 00:58:02,318
[SPEAKER_27]: because that's the only way we can move forward.

684
00:58:02,358 --> 00:58:04,279
[SPEAKER_27]: We need the administration's office.

685
00:58:04,359 --> 00:58:06,039
[SPEAKER_27]: We need this council, the school committee.

686
00:58:07,459 --> 00:58:08,880
[SPEAKER_27]: We also need public health.

687
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:15,541
[SPEAKER_27]: We need a doctor or we need somebody from the health department in the city on that task force.

688
00:58:16,141 --> 00:58:23,102
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, prescription drugs are a huge problem, and it's sometimes what leads to this heroin addiction.

689
00:58:23,602 --> 00:58:28,483
[SPEAKER_27]: So I think the right people, a great deal of people, need to step forward.

690
00:58:29,055 --> 00:58:31,936
[SPEAKER_27]: go to the city council meeting, attend this vigil.

691
00:58:32,056 --> 00:58:37,579
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, the more awareness we can bring forward to this, this city, the better, and I hope it saves lives.

692
00:58:37,619 --> 00:58:38,720
[SPEAKER_27]: And I thank you for being here.

693
00:58:44,662 --> 00:58:47,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

694
00:58:47,384 --> 00:58:54,507
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, you know, those, those statements were very powerful that were, uh, mentioned here tonight.

695
00:58:55,287 --> 00:59:03,852
[SPEAKER_06]: And as I'm aware and many people are aware, the first step to recovery is to admit that there's a problem.

696
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:05,352
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the first step.

697
00:59:06,193 --> 00:59:19,300
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think that this community, and when I say the community, the residents, the elected officials, the public safety officials, have taken the first step yet to admitting there's a problem in our community.

698
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:24,943
[SPEAKER_06]: And I, as a member of the council, would like to see us as a council tonight

699
00:59:25,877 --> 00:59:37,002
[SPEAKER_06]: send out a message as a council stating that we believe that there's a major concern with drugs in our community, and there's many addictions.

700
00:59:37,943 --> 00:59:40,724
[SPEAKER_06]: We heard some stories here tonight, and I thank my colleagues for sharing them.

701
00:59:41,304 --> 00:59:42,585
[SPEAKER_06]: I shared a story that I had.

702
00:59:42,685 --> 00:59:49,128
[SPEAKER_06]: My father was addicted to gambling and tore our family apart when I was a youngster with four kids in the home.

703
00:59:49,808 --> 00:59:53,310
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, it's a different addiction, but

704
00:59:54,171 --> 01:00:02,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Many people experience many different types of addictions, whether it's drug, whether it's womanizing, whether it's gambling.

705
01:00:02,816 --> 01:00:04,817
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of different addictions out there.

706
01:00:05,558 --> 01:00:09,780
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would like tonight for us to take a vote, Mr. President.

707
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:22,387
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we voted to set up roundtable discussions, but I think we should, as a community, because as the gentleman mentioned tonight, and he really put it forward that, you know,

708
01:00:23,046 --> 01:00:26,248
[SPEAKER_06]: When he looked at members of the council, he saw blank stares.

709
01:00:26,989 --> 01:00:33,953
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll be the first to say, I wasn't aware of how many people have died over the last few years from overdoses.

710
01:00:34,393 --> 01:00:35,134
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard about it.

711
01:00:35,394 --> 01:00:37,235
[SPEAKER_06]: I've known people, absolutely.

712
01:00:37,996 --> 01:00:42,759
[SPEAKER_06]: But I wasn't aware of the epidemic that was going on in this community.

713
01:00:43,499 --> 01:00:46,601
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think tonight was a real eye-opening.

714
01:00:50,724 --> 01:00:51,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight was a real eye-opening.

715
01:00:53,457 --> 01:00:58,000
[SPEAKER_06]: when you hear firsthand accounts of what's taking place in our community.

716
01:00:58,781 --> 01:01:12,812
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can no longer turn a blind eye anymore in this community and pretend that nothing's happening because we're the city of Method and, you know, we're a great community and things like that don't happen in Method.

717
01:01:13,212 --> 01:01:18,836
[SPEAKER_06]: As we heard tonight, it happens in every socioeconomic, on all different levels.

718
01:01:19,757 --> 01:01:20,718
[SPEAKER_06]: No one's immune to this.

719
01:01:22,577 --> 01:01:31,080
[SPEAKER_06]: It's evident, even when you turn on the TV and see famous movie stars that are going through the same addictions and have passed away.

720
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:37,622
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is not to any particular class, not to particular to any ethnicity.

721
01:01:38,002 --> 01:01:40,563
[SPEAKER_06]: This impacts everyone, Mr. President.

722
01:01:41,223 --> 01:01:49,346
[SPEAKER_06]: And I really would like to take a vote tonight of this council going on record, saying that we believe there's an epidemic in this community.

723
01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:50,930
[SPEAKER_06]: that needs to be addressed.

724
01:01:51,831 --> 01:02:01,454
[SPEAKER_06]: We may need to call in state officials in this also, state delegation, you know, and to this, Mr. President, whatever it takes.

725
01:02:01,534 --> 01:02:18,300
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think it's about time that we put the same emphasis, as was mentioned tonight, on fixing potholes in our roads, on making sure that we have public safety and making sure that the community is operating well.

726
01:02:18,710 --> 01:02:23,934
[SPEAKER_06]: And in one aspect, we have a part of the community that many people aren't aware of.

727
01:02:23,994 --> 01:02:29,217
[SPEAKER_06]: It's almost like an underground thing that's going on that many people aren't aware of.

728
01:02:29,617 --> 01:02:33,080
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we have to raise it up and maybe make it a front-page story.

729
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:34,420
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the transcript's here tonight.

730
01:02:34,941 --> 01:02:36,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Make it a front-page story.

731
01:02:36,522 --> 01:02:38,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Let people know what's going on.

732
01:02:38,503 --> 01:02:44,027
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe we can bring this community together and fight this very deadly disease, Mr. President.

733
01:02:44,667 --> 01:02:47,149
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would move that we take a vote.

734
01:02:48,243 --> 01:03:01,012
[SPEAKER_06]: by this council to say that there's an epidemic in this community and that emergency attention is needed to fight this war on drugs and narcotics in this community, Mr. President.

735
01:03:08,918 --> 01:03:09,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.

736
01:03:09,138 --> 01:03:09,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Let him speak.

737
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:12,781
[SPEAKER_23]: Go ahead.

738
01:03:12,921 --> 01:03:14,642
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, Michael Ruggiero, 18 Pembroke Street.

739
01:03:15,566 --> 01:03:17,626
[SPEAKER_23]: I've been doing some research on heroin addiction.

740
01:03:18,887 --> 01:03:19,887
[SPEAKER_23]: The numbers are staggering.

741
01:03:20,407 --> 01:03:29,369
[SPEAKER_23]: Currently, right now, in America, about a million people are believed to be addicted to heroin, not mentioning the lives that have lost, the stories that we've heard today.

742
01:03:30,449 --> 01:03:34,550
[SPEAKER_23]: But $20 billion have lost in crime that's generated.

743
01:03:34,590 --> 01:03:36,450
[SPEAKER_23]: It's obviously a problem that Medford needs to deal with.

744
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:45,052
[SPEAKER_23]: One thing I want to bring up, however, that has only been touched on the periphery tonight, is how methadone is one of the most proven treatments to handle actual

745
01:03:45,650 --> 01:03:47,871
[SPEAKER_23]: long-term heroin abuse.

746
01:03:48,572 --> 01:03:54,656
[SPEAKER_23]: It is often believed that methadone clinics will increase crime in a community, but there's no evidence of that.

747
01:03:54,916 --> 01:03:58,498
[SPEAKER_23]: If anything, there's evidence that long-term treatment facilities actually help.

748
01:03:59,199 --> 01:04:13,348
[SPEAKER_23]: So I just wanted to bring to the Council's attention, perhaps, while committees are certainly useful in uncovering solutions, perhaps one thing that needs to be considered is methadone treatment in the country.

749
01:04:13,668 --> 01:04:13,888
Thank you.

750
01:04:20,618 --> 01:04:21,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Pinto.

751
01:04:23,279 --> 01:04:30,483
[SPEAKER_08]: This is one of the very few times that I guess I'm lost for words because it's maybe Councilor Camuso, maybe you hit it right in the head.

752
01:04:30,503 --> 01:04:40,388
[SPEAKER_08]: The fact of the matter is, I look at this as the evil empire of a disease that apparently has come into our community and it's been neglected.

753
01:04:40,988 --> 01:04:45,591
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's roared its ugly head to such a point that this demon of a disease now

754
01:04:48,307 --> 01:04:54,071
[SPEAKER_08]: has brought folks who are dealing with this on a daily basis to the city council.

755
01:04:55,292 --> 01:04:56,913
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we all are.

756
01:04:56,953 --> 01:04:57,753
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll speak for myself.

757
01:04:59,714 --> 01:05:01,115
[SPEAKER_08]: In the family, yes, there is.

758
01:05:01,356 --> 01:05:03,057
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll just leave it at that.

759
01:05:03,137 --> 01:05:06,439
[SPEAKER_08]: I have an understanding as to what's being said.

760
01:05:06,479 --> 01:05:09,041
[SPEAKER_08]: But my opinion would be this.

761
01:05:09,361 --> 01:05:15,885
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the city needs to make a full-fledged financial, educational, and social, and a budgetary commitment

762
01:05:16,587 --> 01:05:25,516
[SPEAKER_08]: that if we're really going to be serious, we're going to take this right down to the lowest level of education, starting with the kids who are in nursery school, not nursery, what's the next level?

763
01:05:25,956 --> 01:05:32,262
[SPEAKER_08]: First grade, and all the way up, and let them understand the danger of what this disease is all about.

764
01:05:32,883 --> 01:05:38,589
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, Councilor Caviello talked about his friend, 61 years old, Councilor Camuso, his age just a little bit younger.

765
01:05:39,317 --> 01:05:44,822
[SPEAKER_08]: There's other folks even younger, and there are adults, mothers and fathers who sometimes become addicted.

766
01:05:45,323 --> 01:05:47,325
[SPEAKER_08]: For why it happens, I don't know.

767
01:05:48,506 --> 01:06:04,341
[SPEAKER_08]: But if this city has the good fortune to go out of its way to raise over a million dollars for a brand new peace garden, they can go out of its way to find the necessary tools to have a budget appropriation that's going to deal with this.

768
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:16,249
[SPEAKER_08]: as part of the medical justification why the city of Medford does care about its inhabitants, its students, its families, its mothers, its fathers, and anyone who might have an addiction.

769
01:06:16,830 --> 01:06:19,351
[SPEAKER_08]: I think tonight is a big wake-up call for this city.

770
01:06:20,052 --> 01:06:23,415
[SPEAKER_08]: For the folks that came up there and spoke, was it hard to do?

771
01:06:23,495 --> 01:06:27,638
[SPEAKER_08]: It certainly was hard, but I think you're really relieved that you came up here and said it.

772
01:06:28,075 --> 01:06:36,061
[SPEAKER_08]: because you've now got the entire council, I'll leave Councilor De La Ruza to himself, you've got at least six councilors speaking right now, and I think we're all in your court.

773
01:06:37,923 --> 01:06:43,727
[SPEAKER_08]: New Governor Baker, his second commitment was the opiate problem here in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

774
01:06:44,348 --> 01:06:51,093
[SPEAKER_08]: So right from the governor's office all the way down, there is going to be nexus as to how this city and where this city should be going.

775
01:06:51,493 --> 01:06:57,578
[SPEAKER_08]: I not only concur with you, Councilor Marks, I just think it's, you know, it's been laid under the rug for so long

776
01:06:58,503 --> 01:07:03,005
[SPEAKER_08]: And how do you say it other than the fact, you know, enough is enough?

777
01:07:04,086 --> 01:07:09,569
[SPEAKER_08]: The police department, I'm quite sure, can come up here and tell you case after case, story after story, arrest after arrest.

778
01:07:10,509 --> 01:07:12,290
[SPEAKER_08]: It does have an impact in this community.

779
01:07:12,891 --> 01:07:19,494
[SPEAKER_08]: And why should anybody be afraid to say that particular house or that particular part of the city, you know, there's drugs over there more than another part.

780
01:07:19,514 --> 01:07:20,615
[SPEAKER_08]: There should be no drugs at all.

781
01:07:21,627 --> 01:07:22,908
[SPEAKER_08]: There should be no drugs at all.

782
01:07:22,968 --> 01:07:29,913
[SPEAKER_08]: And to get to no drugs at all, friends like Janelle, if you know someone that's on it, you've got to just turn them in and that's it.

783
01:07:30,054 --> 01:07:35,658
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the only way you're going to save their life because no one else is either going to do it or they want to get involved.

784
01:07:36,178 --> 01:07:38,840
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we're seven adults here behind this rail.

785
01:07:39,921 --> 01:07:42,163
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm quite sure they will all agree on this one here.

786
01:07:42,383 --> 01:07:43,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we want to see this continue on?

787
01:07:43,804 --> 01:07:43,984
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

788
01:07:44,004 --> 01:07:45,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we want to see it corrected?

789
01:07:45,245 --> 01:07:45,866
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

790
01:07:46,326 --> 01:07:51,250
[SPEAKER_08]: And the first step is, as Councilman Marks has his resolution going forward, but I honestly think it should be

791
01:07:51,791 --> 01:07:52,832
[SPEAKER_08]: stepped up even further.

792
01:07:53,272 --> 01:07:55,353
[SPEAKER_08]: I think a dollar amount should be put into the budget.

793
01:07:55,393 --> 01:08:02,576
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there should be a social, educational, and a financial commitment.

794
01:08:02,616 --> 01:08:03,196
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know something?

795
01:08:03,216 --> 01:08:04,517
[SPEAKER_08]: The newspaper is here right now.

796
01:08:05,437 --> 01:08:16,962
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'd like to have the newspaper report and make this its headline story as it relates to the Medford City Council recognizes the drug problem in the city of Medford, and they're going to demand from the city administration that action takes place

797
01:08:17,273 --> 01:08:29,881
[SPEAKER_08]: to protect those that are either in the program or having drugs, and to protect the families that have children, unfortunately, who are addicted to this, because they need help just as much as the person that's addicted in the program.

798
01:08:30,581 --> 01:08:43,409
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I would hope that you, as leader of our council, conclude by offering not only your support to Councilor Marks' resolution, but let's have the folks walk out of this audience here tonight and recognize they came here

799
01:08:43,862 --> 01:08:48,085
[SPEAKER_08]: with a true and honest and a just purpose, and they did get results tonight.

800
01:08:48,325 --> 01:08:52,128
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't get lip service, they didn't get a press conference, and I thank you for Councilor Camuso.

801
01:08:52,408 --> 01:08:53,950
[SPEAKER_08]: You did bring that up a few weeks ago.

802
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:56,492
[SPEAKER_08]: The mayor tried a jump shot, but he didn't do it.

803
01:08:56,572 --> 01:08:58,433
[SPEAKER_08]: You beat him to the punch because you were legitimate.

804
01:08:58,673 --> 01:09:00,935
[SPEAKER_08]: The issue was legitimate, and that's where it belongs.

805
01:09:01,215 --> 01:09:04,157
[SPEAKER_08]: It has a smack of legitimacy that needs to be addressed.

806
01:09:04,438 --> 01:09:05,679
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a phony, come on.

807
01:09:05,959 --> 01:09:08,461
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a true reality in life here in the city of Medford.

808
01:09:08,721 --> 01:09:12,864
[SPEAKER_08]: And if drugs are out there, then the first thing to do is you have to recognize it,

809
01:09:13,265 --> 01:09:15,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Address it and work to get rid of it slowly.

810
01:09:16,047 --> 01:09:27,635
[SPEAKER_08]: And the only way you're going to do that is you're going to have to bring it to the attention of every single person, and starting with just your children at the youngest of age, to let them know that this is not good for their health, their mind, their body, and their spirit.

811
01:09:27,855 --> 01:09:28,175
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

812
01:09:35,801 --> 01:09:36,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, Council.

813
01:09:37,582 --> 01:09:39,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Leo Sacco, 100 Main Street.

814
01:09:40,153 --> 01:09:43,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, I work as one of the drug detectives in the city of Medford.

815
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:45,735
[SPEAKER_05]: I go to the overdoses.

816
01:09:47,056 --> 01:09:50,097
[SPEAKER_05]: I've actually witnessed firsthand what heroin does to people.

817
01:09:52,058 --> 01:09:58,041
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not one person sitting here tonight in front of me, I have not made a drug arrest anywhere near your house.

818
01:09:58,881 --> 01:10:06,904
[SPEAKER_05]: It affects every socioeconomic, I mean, the middle class, the lower class, and it's out there.

819
01:10:07,105 --> 01:10:08,225
[SPEAKER_05]: And the heroin's not coming.

820
01:10:09,613 --> 01:10:11,653
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not coming from the city of Medford.

821
01:10:12,093 --> 01:10:13,574
[SPEAKER_05]: It's being brought in from other people.

822
01:10:13,594 --> 01:10:15,474
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure there's people here now that know that.

823
01:10:18,495 --> 01:10:22,235
[SPEAKER_05]: We have done our best, day in and day out, to try to combat that.

824
01:10:23,395 --> 01:10:26,056
[SPEAKER_05]: The statistics speak for themselves.

825
01:10:27,216 --> 01:10:33,177
[SPEAKER_05]: There isn't a week that doesn't go by in the Medford transcript where I haven't personally arrested somebody for the distribution of heroin.

826
01:10:34,557 --> 01:10:38,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Just this past two weeks ago, Mr. Garrity, I'm sorry for your loss.

827
01:10:40,033 --> 01:10:42,854
[SPEAKER_05]: My brother played hockey with Mr. Garrity's son.

828
01:10:43,754 --> 01:10:44,875
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew up in North Medford.

829
01:10:45,755 --> 01:10:49,456
[SPEAKER_05]: I do take this very, very personally, okay, because it hits home.

830
01:10:52,857 --> 01:10:58,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Two weeks ago, the Memphis Police Department did a search warrant at a house in North Medford.

831
01:10:59,979 --> 01:11:00,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Very well known.

832
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:07,522
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to get into the particulars, but we got over 20 grams of heroin, substantial amount of cash,

833
01:11:08,495 --> 01:11:12,736
[SPEAKER_05]: But all of that was coming from outside the community, and we're allowing it to happen.

834
01:11:13,676 --> 01:11:14,796
[SPEAKER_05]: I work with the state police.

835
01:11:15,496 --> 01:11:21,997
[SPEAKER_05]: We just got 6,000 Percocet pills right off of the Felsway, over $47,000 in cash.

836
01:11:23,598 --> 01:11:24,558
[SPEAKER_05]: We're doing our best.

837
01:11:24,638 --> 01:11:30,019
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand that as a police department, we should be doing even more to educate the community.

838
01:11:31,119 --> 01:11:34,219
[SPEAKER_05]: And we try, day in and day out, to talk to those people that are addicted.

839
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:37,140
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that there's people sitting here right now

840
01:11:37,782 --> 01:11:42,465
[SPEAKER_05]: in this forum that have their own personal opinion of me and the way I am.

841
01:11:43,405 --> 01:11:49,988
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's because of how close that disease hits home that I am the way I am.

842
01:11:51,149 --> 01:11:57,292
[SPEAKER_05]: So we will do everything in our power as a law enforcement community to help out the city of Medford.

843
01:11:57,773 --> 01:11:58,833
[SPEAKER_05]: But we need help.

844
01:11:59,634 --> 01:12:02,515
[SPEAKER_05]: When I talk to somebody, the biggest thing is they don't want to snitch.

845
01:12:02,955 --> 01:12:03,656
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't want to rap.

846
01:12:06,132 --> 01:12:06,832
[SPEAKER_05]: We need help.

847
01:12:06,892 --> 01:12:10,074
[SPEAKER_05]: The community needs to pick up the phone and call us.

848
01:12:11,515 --> 01:12:13,316
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, and you have to be persistent.

849
01:12:14,237 --> 01:12:16,998
[SPEAKER_05]: You may not get us in the first time, but you have to call us.

850
01:12:17,058 --> 01:12:19,400
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's a problem, we have to be, we have to know about it.

851
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,541
[SPEAKER_05]: I have so many contacts.

852
01:12:21,601 --> 01:12:22,682
[SPEAKER_05]: I have probation officers.

853
01:12:22,762 --> 01:12:31,727
[SPEAKER_05]: I have people that can get people that are addicted to this disease in the right, that we can steer them in the right direction, but I need their help.

854
01:12:33,388 --> 01:12:33,528
[SPEAKER_05]: So,

855
01:12:35,008 --> 01:12:38,029
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm begging that the community picks up the phone and calls us.

856
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:41,971
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'll do what I can to get those people the help that they need.

857
01:12:42,911 --> 01:12:49,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

858
01:12:49,553 --> 01:12:51,094
[SPEAKER_27]: What's the best phone number to call?

859
01:12:51,114 --> 01:12:53,015
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, who do you ask for?

860
01:12:53,035 --> 01:13:04,499
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, for people that are watching or because a lot of times, you know, even just other issues, whether it's drug related or people trying to report a house, they think drugs are involved and they say they get, you know, kind of turned off by the main office.

861
01:13:05,094 --> 01:13:05,754
[SPEAKER_27]: Where do they call?

862
01:13:06,055 --> 01:13:07,896
[SPEAKER_27]: Do they call the detectives?

863
01:13:08,136 --> 01:13:12,398
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a hotline, 781-391-6767.

864
01:13:12,518 --> 01:13:21,743
[SPEAKER_05]: And for anybody that's serious about picking up the phone, I'll give them my business card.

865
01:13:22,183 --> 01:13:23,243
[SPEAKER_05]: They can call me 24-7.

866
01:13:24,044 --> 01:13:24,724
[SPEAKER_05]: I live in the city.

867
01:13:25,725 --> 01:13:28,206
[SPEAKER_05]: It won't be the first time I got woken up about something like this.

868
01:13:29,326 --> 01:13:29,546
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.

869
01:13:29,606 --> 01:13:30,707
[SPEAKER_05]: I take this very personally.

870
01:13:31,948 --> 01:13:33,969
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, we know how busy you are.

871
01:13:34,905 --> 01:13:36,046
[SPEAKER_27]: bust right in front of my house.

872
01:13:36,646 --> 01:13:38,568
[SPEAKER_27]: I've seen you working right near my office.

873
01:13:39,588 --> 01:13:41,049
[SPEAKER_27]: I saw another one on Millsex Ave.

874
01:13:41,089 --> 01:13:42,090
[SPEAKER_27]: This is in the last year.

875
01:13:42,510 --> 01:13:43,731
[SPEAKER_27]: So we know how busy you are.

876
01:13:43,771 --> 01:13:57,881
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, are there, do you have detective committee meetings with regards to how, you know, whether it's communication into the police department, how it's documented, how you can better improve like documentation or your response?

877
01:13:57,901 --> 01:14:02,805
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, is there ways that, or is there ways the city can help you make it more effective?

878
01:14:03,518 --> 01:14:06,520
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that Team Medfit has been implemented to help out.

879
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:10,702
[SPEAKER_05]: I have been in touch with Penny and Brooke, Officer Lokowicz.

880
01:14:12,323 --> 01:14:13,123
[SPEAKER_05]: They're instrumental.

881
01:14:13,743 --> 01:14:16,565
[SPEAKER_05]: All the heroin overdoses right now, they're all cut with fentanyl.

882
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:35,801
[SPEAKER_19]: Before I gave it to them, I looked at it.

883
01:14:35,821 --> 01:14:39,023
[SPEAKER_19]: I told them who this killer was.

884
01:14:39,063 --> 01:14:41,143
[SPEAKER_19]: I told them who to call.

885
01:14:41,264 --> 01:14:41,544
[SPEAKER_19]: They knew.

886
01:14:41,724 --> 01:14:47,346
[SPEAKER_19]: When I got this phone call, I called the killer.

887
01:14:49,527 --> 01:14:51,168
[SPEAKER_19]: I called him.

888
01:14:51,188 --> 01:14:53,409
[SPEAKER_19]: I said, give me Gary, Jay's mom.

889
01:14:53,449 --> 01:14:54,789
[SPEAKER_19]: He knows my son.

890
01:14:54,829 --> 01:14:56,250
[SPEAKER_19]: We spoke.

891
01:14:56,290 --> 01:15:00,552
[SPEAKER_19]: They could have called me.

892
01:15:00,572 --> 01:15:01,252
[SPEAKER_19]: They could have.

893
01:15:01,673 --> 01:15:02,413
[SPEAKER_19]: They knew me.

894
01:15:03,452 --> 01:15:03,872
[SPEAKER_19]: They didn't.

895
01:15:03,892 --> 01:15:05,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Does he live in Medford?

896
01:15:05,912 --> 01:15:06,913
[SPEAKER_19]: He's dead now.

897
01:15:07,253 --> 01:15:08,113
[SPEAKER_19]: No one knows.

898
01:15:10,453 --> 01:15:16,134
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm sorry for you some here, but what we're saying really, really annoys me.

899
01:15:16,734 --> 01:15:18,215
[SPEAKER_19]: Two weeks ahead is long.

900
01:15:19,095 --> 01:15:21,955
[SPEAKER_19]: One day, I have, we've had a conversation.

901
01:15:22,475 --> 01:15:29,897
As a student, I know, deep in my heart, I know my son did not die of heroin.

902
01:15:30,337 --> 01:15:32,317
There were bad shit out there.

903
01:15:33,064 --> 01:15:36,928
It's something wrong, right?

904
01:15:37,269 --> 01:15:38,891
I said, let's speak.

905
01:15:38,971 --> 01:15:39,612
Let's speak.

906
01:15:39,632 --> 01:15:40,593
I didn't hear.

907
01:15:40,613 --> 01:15:42,014
I didn't hear.

908
01:15:42,034 --> 01:15:43,816
I didn't hear anything.

909
01:15:43,836 --> 01:15:45,158
I didn't hear anything.

910
01:15:45,218 --> 01:15:46,580
How come I'm dead?

911
01:15:47,881 --> 01:15:49,403
How come they didn't call me?

912
01:15:49,623 --> 01:15:50,064
How come?

913
01:15:51,366 --> 01:15:58,329
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, how long does it take to come up to talk to you and say, what's happening to you?

914
01:15:58,429 --> 01:16:00,169
And I said, I said, come on.

915
01:16:00,189 --> 01:16:01,850
I said, there it is.

916
01:16:01,930 --> 01:16:02,430
[SPEAKER_19]: Come on.

917
01:16:02,530 --> 01:16:02,990
[SPEAKER_19]: That's it.

918
01:16:03,010 --> 01:16:03,331
[SPEAKER_19]: Right there.

919
01:16:04,271 --> 01:16:05,391
[SPEAKER_19]: There it is.

920
01:16:06,412 --> 01:16:07,052
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't be afraid.

921
01:16:07,072 --> 01:16:07,772
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't be scared.

922
01:16:07,792 --> 01:16:11,134
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't be, you know, scared of all of them.

923
01:16:11,494 --> 01:16:14,815
Don't be frightened, don't be.

924
01:16:24,036 --> 01:16:24,856
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize.

925
01:16:25,657 --> 01:16:28,278
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't speak for the officers that went that day.

926
01:16:28,979 --> 01:16:30,860
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a policy that is implemented.

927
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:38,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Any cell phones that are seized at the time of an overdose death get turned over to the state police.

928
01:16:39,764 --> 01:16:41,465
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have access to those phones.

929
01:16:43,446 --> 01:16:46,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Any death that's suspicious, the state police get called in on.

930
01:16:47,268 --> 01:16:48,649
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't come to my office.

931
01:16:48,729 --> 01:16:50,090
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't get to see those phones.

932
01:16:51,150 --> 01:16:52,371
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wish I did.

933
01:16:54,357 --> 01:17:02,241
[SPEAKER_27]: Just to end, I would like to personally ask you, on behalf of the council, to be involved with this with us.

934
01:17:02,301 --> 01:17:03,942
[SPEAKER_27]: We're going to have committee meetings.

935
01:17:03,962 --> 01:17:04,802
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm not sure.

936
01:17:05,022 --> 01:17:06,563
[SPEAKER_27]: Did you decide when you're going to set that up?

937
01:17:06,683 --> 01:17:08,384
[SPEAKER_27]: Can we hold you to the fire and announce it now?

938
01:17:09,204 --> 01:17:11,866
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't have a day yet, because we have so many people to bring in on it.

939
01:17:12,546 --> 01:17:13,506
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what we're working on.

940
01:17:13,546 --> 01:17:14,647
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, we ask that you be involved.

941
01:17:14,687 --> 01:17:16,788
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, we need people who care, and we can tell you care.

942
01:17:17,248 --> 01:17:18,269
[SPEAKER_05]: I will wholeheartedly.

943
01:17:19,729 --> 01:17:20,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

944
01:17:20,910 --> 01:17:22,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Capiello.

945
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:27,416
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like he says, they make arrests.

946
01:17:27,676 --> 01:17:30,357
[SPEAKER_03]: I read the transcript every week, and you see three, four, five arrests.

947
01:17:31,238 --> 01:17:32,779
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't stop at the police.

948
01:17:34,039 --> 01:17:36,540
[SPEAKER_03]: These guys are arrested, and they're back out on the street the next day.

949
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:45,024
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the judges that let people off with just slapping wrists, come back in 90 days, and they never come back in.

950
01:17:45,744 --> 01:17:51,287
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, maybe it starts with putting the DA officer back in the high school.

951
01:17:51,747 --> 01:17:54,008
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's been years since they've been out of there.

952
01:17:55,233 --> 01:17:58,775
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, a small step, but I say it starts in high school.

953
01:17:59,195 --> 01:18:12,384
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's someone there that these people, these kids can talk to, right then, I say, if there's officers out there, they could all rotate as a DARE officer at the high school or at the different schools.

954
01:18:12,844 --> 01:18:15,226
[SPEAKER_03]: So this way, these kids will know they have somewhere to go to.

955
01:18:17,227 --> 01:18:19,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody sees something, say something.

956
01:18:19,208 --> 01:18:23,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if these kids, if they have a personal interaction,

957
01:18:24,368 --> 01:18:26,869
[SPEAKER_03]: at school with an officer, maybe they won't be afraid to say something.

958
01:18:26,889 --> 01:18:30,070
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

959
01:18:30,090 --> 01:18:30,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

960
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:36,513
[SPEAKER_27]: If you're going to move that as an amendment, I just asked that Dea would come back and grade school.

961
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:40,274
[SPEAKER_27]: So if I could add, you put that as amendment.

962
01:18:40,294 --> 01:18:40,754
[SPEAKER_27]: Every school.

963
01:18:41,494 --> 01:18:47,176
[SPEAKER_27]: I think we asked the school committee to implement this within our school system.

964
01:18:47,216 --> 01:18:51,438
[SPEAKER_27]: My daughter is six and a half years old, and I already tried to teach her about drugs.

965
01:18:51,458 --> 01:18:52,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Start right in the middle schools.

966
01:18:54,763 --> 01:18:57,965
[SPEAKER_03]: The elementary schools, as I said, we have enough police officers.

967
01:18:58,246 --> 01:19:01,768
[SPEAKER_03]: They can rotate a different day, a couple days a week.

968
01:19:02,689 --> 01:19:06,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether they want to volunteer, it's time everybody in the community steps up.

969
01:19:07,932 --> 01:19:13,276
[SPEAKER_16]: On the petition of Janelle Rocco, I see that.

970
01:19:13,636 --> 01:19:22,722
[SPEAKER_16]: On the petition of Janelle Rocco, amended by councillors Knight, Mox, Caraviello, and Penta.

971
01:19:24,272 --> 01:19:25,273
[SPEAKER_16]: Ma'am, you wish to speak?

972
01:19:26,073 --> 01:19:26,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, just quickly.

973
01:19:27,294 --> 01:19:30,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, my name is Linda Ciccolo, and I live on Ravine Road in Medford.

974
01:19:31,077 --> 01:19:33,840
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's been three overdoses on my street, two fatal.

975
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,561
[SPEAKER_04]: My son was one that survived.

976
01:19:36,262 --> 01:19:40,445
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason that he survived is because the first responders carried the Narcan.

977
01:19:40,865 --> 01:19:51,954
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to mention how important I think that it is for the fire department and for the police also to carry the Narcan, because again, he's eight months clean, and it saved his life.

978
01:19:52,459 --> 01:19:59,983
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe, and I stand to be corrected, are knockout police officers or a fire department being trained on the administration of the process?

979
01:20:00,003 --> 01:20:00,744
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so, yeah.

980
01:20:00,804 --> 01:20:04,446
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we as parents, we have the knock-in.

981
01:20:04,566 --> 01:20:05,046
[SPEAKER_04]: We have them.

982
01:20:06,126 --> 01:20:07,447
[SPEAKER_04]: We take classes.

983
01:20:07,507 --> 01:20:08,588
[SPEAKER_04]: We're from Families and Arms.

984
01:20:08,808 --> 01:20:10,169
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trained to use the knock-in.

985
01:20:10,629 --> 01:20:17,453
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I just believe that it's real important that the police and the fire carry the knock-in.

986
01:20:17,473 --> 01:20:20,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Because again, my son wouldn't be here if it weren't for the first responders.

987
01:20:21,255 --> 01:20:21,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

988
01:20:27,758 --> 01:20:29,399
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

[SPEAKER_08]: I want to go back to Councillor Caviello.

[SPEAKER_08]: program.

995
01:20:35,823 --> 01:20:36,624

996
01:20:36,644 --> 01:20:37,244

1000

1007
01:20:53,905 --> 01:21:00,609
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just going to suggest, Mr. President, that due to the fact that we're having a committee meeting on this stuff, we'll have a lot of good ideas and a lot of suggestions.

1008
01:21:00,849 --> 01:21:06,072
[SPEAKER_16]: A lot of it will come out of this, especially since we'll be aided with people with expertise on the matter.

01:21:06,092 --> 01:21:08,253

1070
01:25:57,990 --> 01:26:04,692

[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1072
01:26:06,092 --> 01:26:10,193
[SPEAKER_17]: And he's come over here to Medford now, and I think he might even have a little blue and white in those veins.

1073
01:26:10,553 --> 01:26:17,555
[SPEAKER_17]: So if we could have this tape sent over to the city of Malvern to be aired on their local access television show, Mr. President, I'd appreciate that.

1074
01:26:17,735 --> 01:26:20,215
[SPEAKER_17]: It was really tough putting that hat on the first time.

1075
01:26:21,876 --> 01:26:24,136
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think you forgot to thank one more person, Sean.

01:27:44,626 --> 01:27:44,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Castro?

1127
01:27:44,886 --> 01:27:45,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Castro?

1128
01:27:45,586 --> 01:27:45,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Castro?

1129
01:27:46,506 --> 01:27:46,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Castro?

1130
01:27:46,967 --> 01:27:47,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Castro?

1131
01:27:47,167 --> 01:27:48,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Castro?

1132
01:27:48,107 --> 01:27:49,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Castro?

1133
01:27:49,207 --> 01:27:49,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Castro?

1134
01:27:49,747 --> 01:27:49,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Castro?

1135
01:27:49,987 --> 01:27:50,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Castro?

1136
01:27:50,268 --> 01:27:50,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Castro?

1137
01:27:50,568 --> 01:27:50,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Castro?

1138
01:27:50,868 --> 01:27:51,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Castro?

1139
01:27:51,088 --> 01:27:51,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Castro?

1140
01:27:51,528 --> 01:27:51,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Castro?

1141
01:27:52,849 --> 01:27:54,630
[SPEAKER_26]: I got blacked out.

1142
01:27:54,710 --> 01:27:55,850
[SPEAKER_26]: I got so nervous.

1143
01:27:55,990 --> 01:27:57,771
[SPEAKER_26]: I've never been in front of something like this before.

1144
01:27:57,791 --> 01:28:03,294
[SPEAKER_26]: And you guys were talking about, like last week, you were talking about some important stuff, and like today, too.

1145
01:28:03,794 --> 01:28:06,915
[SPEAKER_26]: And then I come across, and I was like, ugh.

1146
01:28:07,315 --> 01:28:07,796
[SPEAKER_26]: So I fell.

1147
01:28:08,336 --> 01:28:12,038
[SPEAKER_26]: And it's like, this thing kind of taken some time.

1148
01:28:12,138 --> 01:28:14,559
[SPEAKER_26]: I applied like two months ago, something like that.

1149
01:28:14,839 --> 01:28:19,781
[SPEAKER_26]: And I've been contacting the city clerk, and then they put me in contact with the police.

1150
01:28:20,393 --> 01:28:23,135
[SPEAKER_26]: And at first, the lady was on vacation or something.

1151
01:28:23,696 --> 01:28:27,759
[SPEAKER_26]: Then she came back, and I've been contacting her looking for my application.

1152
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:33,684
[SPEAKER_26]: And with the snow and everything coming, and she couldn't talk to the chief because he was so busy.

1153
01:28:34,405 --> 01:28:36,687
[SPEAKER_26]: And finally, they found out that my application was lost.

1154
01:28:37,807 --> 01:28:43,973
[SPEAKER_26]: And then she said, a couple of weeks ago, and then she said to me to contact the city clerk to ask Sylvia to fax it over.

1155
01:28:43,993 --> 01:28:44,673
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's why.

1156
01:28:45,454 --> 01:28:46,495
[SPEAKER_26]: And I know where the place is.

1157
01:28:46,555 --> 01:28:47,956
[SPEAKER_26]: I know the guy, the owner.

1158
01:28:48,696 --> 01:28:50,837
[SPEAKER_26]: We have a motion, Mr. Chairman.

1159
01:28:51,997 --> 01:28:57,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, as I said last week, you know you're only allowed to pick up MedFed.

1160
01:28:58,019 --> 01:28:58,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1161
01:28:59,799 --> 01:29:00,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you get your cab?

1162
01:29:01,220 --> 01:29:01,640
[SPEAKER_26]: At 121.

1163
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:04,101
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1164
01:29:05,301 --> 01:29:06,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion for approval, Mr. President.

1165
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:08,322
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion for approval by Councilor Caviello.

1166
01:29:08,382 --> 01:29:09,402
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1167
01:29:10,303 --> 01:29:11,323
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

1168
01:29:13,678 --> 01:29:16,500
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Penta is opposed.

1169
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:17,800
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion carries.

1170
01:29:18,721 --> 01:29:19,521
[SPEAKER_26]: All right, thank you very much.

1171
01:29:20,962 --> 01:29:32,249
[SPEAKER_16]: For this reason that he has used in the past, that we have yet to revise the cab ordinance.

1172
01:29:32,709 --> 01:29:37,932
[SPEAKER_16]: And please also mark Councilor Marks in our position too for similar reasons.

1173
01:29:38,372 --> 01:29:39,193
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion carries.

1174
01:29:39,833 --> 01:29:40,774
[SPEAKER_16]: Congratulations, sir.

1175
01:29:40,834 --> 01:29:41,814
[SPEAKER_16]: You have your license.

1176
01:29:42,114 --> 01:29:42,995
[SPEAKER_16]: See the clerk tomorrow.

1177
01:29:43,595 --> 01:29:50,518
[SPEAKER_16]: 15-076, taxi operation license by Mr. Mamadou Balde.

1178
01:29:52,118 --> 01:29:53,679
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Balde, are you present?

1179
01:29:55,740 --> 01:29:56,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Counselor Caviello.

1180
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:57,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1181
01:29:57,901 --> 01:30:02,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I reviewed these records and I do have a question and I think I spoke to the gentleman earlier.

1182
01:30:03,363 --> 01:30:07,804
[SPEAKER_03]: The gentleman has outstanding moving violations that he has not paid.

1183
01:30:10,605 --> 01:30:11,986
[SPEAKER_03]: And I explained to him earlier,

1184
01:30:12,403 --> 01:30:13,804
[SPEAKER_03]: that he said he's gonna pay them.

1185
01:30:16,765 --> 01:30:28,572
[SPEAKER_03]: I will make the motion of approval with the stipulation that before his license is given to him from the clerk, that he brings back a receipt showing that his moving violations have been paid.

1186
01:30:29,893 --> 01:30:32,514
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Councilor Caviello, all those in favor?

1187
01:30:33,875 --> 01:30:35,236
[SPEAKER_16]: On that motion, Councilor Penta.

1188
01:30:35,256 --> 01:30:38,898
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe also,

1189
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:44,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Over and beyond the moving violation, there's another one in there.

1190
01:30:46,302 --> 01:30:47,323
[SPEAKER_08]: Unpaid parking tickets.

1191
01:30:48,764 --> 01:30:49,264
[SPEAKER_08]: What about them?

1192
01:30:50,284 --> 01:30:52,546
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's the big snow.

1193
01:30:53,046 --> 01:30:53,326
[SPEAKER_01]: Parking?

1194
01:30:53,586 --> 01:30:57,608
[SPEAKER_01]: When there was the snow, the big one, my son was sick.

1195
01:30:57,688 --> 01:31:02,291
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to the 313 or HS3.

1196
01:31:03,451 --> 01:31:04,612
[SPEAKER_01]: I was parking.

1197
01:31:04,912 --> 01:31:06,173
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy came, he said, move in there.

1198
01:31:06,253 --> 01:31:07,493
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, OK, I'm going to move.

1199
01:31:07,894 --> 01:31:10,015
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying to move, but the car was stuck.

1200
01:31:10,977 --> 01:31:12,778
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, I try, I try, I cannot move.

1201
01:31:13,378 --> 01:31:15,160
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I wait to see my son before I came.

1202
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:17,201
[SPEAKER_01]: I get the thing.

1203
01:31:17,581 --> 01:31:20,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Sir, you made your application out on December 4th of 2014.

1204
01:31:21,203 --> 01:31:21,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1205
01:31:21,463 --> 01:31:26,126
[SPEAKER_08]: And the question was asked, do you owe money for any parking fines?

1206
01:31:26,186 --> 01:31:28,067
[SPEAKER_08]: And the answer is yes.

1207
01:31:28,227 --> 01:31:29,728
[SPEAKER_08]: And do you owe money for parking tickets?

1208
01:31:29,788 --> 01:31:30,549
[SPEAKER_08]: And the answer is yes.

1209
01:31:31,910 --> 01:31:32,290
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't owe.

1210
01:31:34,391 --> 01:31:36,853
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but he's trying to, this was in December.

1211
01:31:37,573 --> 01:31:39,314
[SPEAKER_08]: You haven't paid since December.

1212
01:31:39,574 --> 01:31:40,475
[SPEAKER_08]: This is now March.

1213
01:31:42,870 --> 01:31:46,594
[SPEAKER_08]: And what is the traffic violation for?

1214
01:31:46,954 --> 01:31:51,999
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what in Medford, Boston Medical Center.

1215
01:31:52,259 --> 01:31:53,440
[SPEAKER_01]: Boston Medical Center.

1216
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:54,381
[SPEAKER_01]: I was coming back.

1217
01:31:54,821 --> 01:31:56,883
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not red.

1218
01:31:56,903 --> 01:32:00,046
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the truck in the front side to me.

1219
01:32:00,266 --> 01:32:00,867
[SPEAKER_01]: I was coming.

1220
01:32:01,668 --> 01:32:02,008
[SPEAKER_01]: I was coming.

1221
01:32:02,068 --> 01:32:02,488
[SPEAKER_01]: It was red.

1222
01:32:02,508 --> 01:32:03,610
[SPEAKER_01]: It was traffic.

1223
01:32:04,757 --> 01:32:06,758
[SPEAKER_01]: But now the yellow was coming.

1224
01:32:07,598 --> 01:32:08,639
[SPEAKER_01]: I was here in the traffic.

1225
01:32:09,279 --> 01:32:10,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the police came.

1226
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:11,400
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, OK.

1227
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:12,461
[SPEAKER_01]: He told me to try.

1228
01:32:12,501 --> 01:32:12,981
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, no.

1229
01:32:13,381 --> 01:32:14,241
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not here.

1230
01:32:14,322 --> 01:32:14,862
[SPEAKER_01]: It's here.

1231
01:32:14,922 --> 01:32:16,082
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not red.

1232
01:32:16,403 --> 01:32:17,803
[SPEAKER_01]: I told him, I'm going to do IPA.

1233
01:32:17,823 --> 01:32:18,343
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, OK.

1234
01:32:21,805 --> 01:32:22,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you pay that fine?

1235
01:32:22,966 --> 01:32:23,386
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't pay.

1236
01:32:23,406 --> 01:32:24,226
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm going to pay for this.

1237
01:32:24,246 --> 01:32:25,367
[SPEAKER_01]: How much is that fine?

1238
01:32:26,107 --> 01:32:29,929
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I told the police, I'm not going to pay because I'm going to go to the court because it was not red.

1239
01:32:32,857 --> 01:32:33,938
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in the traffic.

1240
01:32:33,958 --> 01:32:35,018
[SPEAKER_01]: It was before the yellow one.

1241
01:32:35,218 --> 01:32:36,379
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I was coming.

1242
01:32:36,399 --> 01:32:37,279
[SPEAKER_08]: Which city was that, sir?

1243
01:32:38,079 --> 01:32:38,580
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in Boston Medical.

1244
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:40,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Boston Medical Center.

1245
01:32:40,421 --> 01:32:41,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Boston Medical Center, yeah.

1246
01:32:41,761 --> 01:32:43,482
[SPEAKER_08]: So you made your appeal to the city of Boston?

1247
01:32:43,502 --> 01:32:43,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1248
01:32:44,002 --> 01:32:44,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you have your hearing?

1249
01:32:45,563 --> 01:32:45,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Please?

1250
01:32:46,023 --> 01:32:46,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you have your hearing?

1251
01:32:47,224 --> 01:32:47,384
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1252
01:32:47,704 --> 01:32:48,985
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm not doing it.

1253
01:32:49,245 --> 01:32:49,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Next week?

1254
01:32:50,105 --> 01:32:50,285
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1255
01:32:50,745 --> 01:32:51,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Next week.

1256
01:32:51,046 --> 01:32:51,826
[SPEAKER_01]: I already did everything.

1257
01:32:51,866 --> 01:32:56,528
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm going to be there maybe, or I don't know, because they're going to send me the data for this one.

1258
01:32:56,828 --> 01:32:57,889
[SPEAKER_08]: And what about the parking tickets?

1259
01:32:57,929 --> 01:32:58,529
[SPEAKER_08]: What about those?

1260
01:32:59,329 --> 01:33:00,550
[SPEAKER_08]: How many parking tickets do you have?

1261
01:33:06,251 --> 01:33:06,971
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I have two.

1262
01:33:07,892 --> 01:33:14,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Chairman, before the license is granted, tickets, and if he's going next week for the hearing, can we hold that off until we get the results?

1263
01:33:14,934 --> 01:33:21,376
[SPEAKER_03]: I say I'll approve the license and the clerk can hold it until he comes in with proof that he paid these.

1264
01:33:24,037 --> 01:33:25,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Seems to be a fair stipulation.

1265
01:33:26,157 --> 01:33:26,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President.

1266
01:33:26,798 --> 01:33:27,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Counselor Marks, please.

1267
01:33:29,702 --> 01:33:38,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, as part of the paperwork, it asked the petitioner to answer a question whether or not they have any outstanding violations.

1268
01:33:39,084 --> 01:33:44,826
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is incumbent upon the petitioner to state whether they have any violations or not.

1269
01:33:46,106 --> 01:33:57,649
[SPEAKER_06]: The Corey check checks for criminal offender record information and doesn't look, I don't believe, and maybe Counselor Camuso would know this better, I don't believe it looks at outstanding tickets, does it?

1270
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:10,789
[SPEAKER_06]: the, the, the Corey, um, maybe it might be a good idea to have along the process somehow, uh, the petitioners of all taxi licenses to submit to the council.

1271
01:34:10,829 --> 01:34:19,296
[SPEAKER_06]: In addition to the paperwork, um, uh, a record showing that, uh, they are free from any type of liability when it comes to tickets.

1272
01:34:19,616 --> 01:34:28,243
[SPEAKER_16]: If I was just instructed, uh, counseling marks by the clerk that, uh, uh, the chief examines all aspects of this before he makes his recommendation.

1273
01:34:28,707 --> 01:34:29,707
[SPEAKER_16]: of moving it up to us.

1274
01:34:30,227 --> 01:34:34,688
[SPEAKER_16]: So those items would be included under the quarry, under the quarry check.

1275
01:34:36,009 --> 01:34:43,050
[SPEAKER_13]: If the clerk would like to answer that perhaps.

1276
01:34:44,930 --> 01:34:56,233
[SPEAKER_13]: So is it safe to say that he met with, uh, individuals on, uh, any violations, you know, and he, you know, to his satisfaction that they had, uh,

1277
01:34:58,762 --> 01:35:00,082
[SPEAKER_13]: told him what he wants to hear.

1278
01:35:00,102 --> 01:35:09,404
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll make his recommendation, but he goes a little bit beyond.

1279
01:35:09,544 --> 01:35:10,824
[SPEAKER_06]: So the chief signing off.

1280
01:35:12,825 --> 01:35:25,767
[SPEAKER_13]: So the chief signing off, Mr. Clark would, uh, I don't have the paperwork, but the chief might've said on his, uh, did you see a letter attached from the chief on there, which is beyond that.

1281
01:35:26,174 --> 01:35:31,797
[SPEAKER_13]: when he originally filed his application, whatever the chief's recommendation is, but he goes out and looks at everything.

1282
01:35:32,498 --> 01:35:53,291
[SPEAKER_16]: And if I could introduce from the chair to the record, February 19th, 2015, from the chief, I have reviewed the application for a taxi operator's license and the quarry reports on the following individual and find no information that would render applicant unsuitable for approval.

1283
01:35:58,136 --> 01:36:12,762
[SPEAKER_06]: I would just say if that's correct, what the chief is telling us, and we go based on the chief, then those two questions within the application itself are meaningless then because the chief is telling us he finds no fault.

1284
01:36:13,482 --> 01:36:17,364
[SPEAKER_16]: He finds no reason not to give a threshold of acceptability.

1285
01:36:23,468 --> 01:36:30,970
[SPEAKER_15]: There may be 30 days between the two documents, between his application and the chief's signing off, which might have been rectified in the middle.

1286
01:36:30,990 --> 01:36:32,691
[SPEAKER_15]: But we were uncertain.

1287
01:36:32,731 --> 01:36:41,733
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think that there's any harm in granting the license with the stipulation that- I mean, if a gentleman's going to be driving people in Medford, what if he gets tickets to Medford?

1288
01:36:41,773 --> 01:36:42,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Is he just not going to pay them?

1289
01:36:42,614 --> 01:36:47,395
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'd feel more comfortable if he paid his tickets.

1290
01:36:49,275 --> 01:36:51,176
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't speak for my other colleagues here.

1291
01:36:52,163 --> 01:37:08,006
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, so on the motion of council caviar, let the license be granted with the stipulation that, uh, uh, evidence be presented to the clerk before the issuance of the license, uh, that the, uh, parking and moving violations be paid.

1292
01:37:08,466 --> 01:37:08,666
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1293
01:37:09,586 --> 01:37:11,946
[SPEAKER_16]: On that motion, although councilor Penta.

1294
01:37:13,247 --> 01:37:15,447
[SPEAKER_08]: The Corey check is basically for criminal background check.

1295
01:37:15,507 --> 01:37:17,907
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not for licenses and it's not for a ticket.

1296
01:37:18,468 --> 01:37:20,248
[SPEAKER_08]: So what the chief is saying is correct.

1297
01:37:20,828 --> 01:37:21,168
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think,

1298
01:37:21,628 --> 01:37:25,689
[SPEAKER_08]: as a city clerk has questioned seven and eight strike that.

1299
01:37:26,509 --> 01:37:31,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, six really wouldn't come up under the query, but seven and eight definitely would not come up under the query.

1300
01:37:32,110 --> 01:37:36,170
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think those need to be, uh, as council max alluded to, I think they need to be addressed.

1301
01:37:36,210 --> 01:37:41,051
[SPEAKER_08]: And I agree with council Caviello, um, to hold us in the dance until both of these are resolved.

1302
01:37:41,631 --> 01:37:44,592
[SPEAKER_08]: But don't forget this application was made getting everybody.

1303
01:37:45,672 --> 01:37:50,613
[SPEAKER_08]: The chief responded on February 19th and this fellow made his application on January 16th.

1304
01:37:53,448 --> 01:37:54,368
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what I don't understand.

1305
01:37:55,449 --> 01:37:57,869
[SPEAKER_08]: He filed on January 16th, 2015.

1306
01:37:58,149 --> 01:38:03,350
[SPEAKER_08]: The last fellow that was up here put his application on December 4th, 2014.

1307
01:38:04,831 --> 01:38:09,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is there such a spread in time before these things get approved?

1308
01:38:11,332 --> 01:38:14,513
[SPEAKER_13]: December 14th and January 15th?

1309
01:38:14,533 --> 01:38:15,353
[SPEAKER_08]: No, December 4th.

1310
01:38:15,833 --> 01:38:16,654
[SPEAKER_08]: December 4th.

1311
01:38:17,154 --> 01:38:19,394
[SPEAKER_08]: The last gentleman applied December 4th.

1312
01:38:19,914 --> 01:38:21,775
[SPEAKER_08]: This gentleman applied January 16th.

1313
01:38:23,270 --> 01:38:33,615
[SPEAKER_13]: the, the holdup, uh, I mean, they fill the application out and then it has to go to the police chief, but we got both.

1314
01:38:33,635 --> 01:38:42,639
[SPEAKER_13]: So, so we don't, we don't place it on the council agenda until the police chief signs off on it.

1315
01:38:42,679 --> 01:38:43,279
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we've got both.

1316
01:38:43,299 --> 01:38:52,303
[SPEAKER_13]: So, so the police chief, and I don't know, I don't, I'm not, I'm not, I don't have the police chief's recent, uh, letter of authorization,

1317
01:38:53,014 --> 01:38:56,335
[SPEAKER_13]: but that's the trigger date for me to put it on the, put it on the agenda.

1318
01:38:57,175 --> 01:39:02,376
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I mean, what is the, uh, is the date that the chief responded back on his February 19th?

1319
01:39:02,776 --> 01:39:04,216
[SPEAKER_13]: February 19th is this report.

1320
01:39:04,416 --> 01:39:04,736
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1321
01:39:04,756 --> 01:39:06,057
[SPEAKER_13]: So he wrote the report.

1322
01:39:06,077 --> 01:39:10,958
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're taking us, you know, uh, we, we might not, he wrote February 18th.

1323
01:39:11,538 --> 01:39:16,119
[SPEAKER_13]: We probably didn't receive it till last week, even though he dated it February 19th.

1324
01:39:16,719 --> 01:39:18,739
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we go and proceed to put them on the agenda.

1325
01:39:18,799 --> 01:39:19,419
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand that.

1326
01:39:19,439 --> 01:39:22,220
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't understand the, both of them came back at the same time.

1327
01:39:22,650 --> 01:39:26,971
[SPEAKER_08]: to be presented before the council, and there's almost a month and a half spread between both applicants.

1328
01:39:28,452 --> 01:39:30,452
[SPEAKER_13]: It's still the police chief.

1329
01:39:32,073 --> 01:39:32,793
[SPEAKER_13]: It's in his hands.

1330
01:39:33,993 --> 01:39:35,714
[SPEAKER_16]: Point of elucidation, Councilman.

1331
01:39:36,054 --> 01:39:40,795
[SPEAKER_16]: I spoke with Mr. Castro before the meeting, and he passed in his paperwork.

1332
01:39:42,275 --> 01:39:44,296
[SPEAKER_15]: Individual was on vacation when he passed it in.

1333
01:39:44,716 --> 01:39:46,236
[SPEAKER_15]: Individual got back from vacation.

1334
01:39:46,256 --> 01:39:48,437
[SPEAKER_15]: His paperwork seemed to have gone missing.

1335
01:39:48,457 --> 01:39:51,178
[SPEAKER_15]: He had to resubmit the paperwork, was what the story was that he told me.

1336
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:58,385
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it would be safe to say that the reason there was a delay was because of a paperwork error administratively, and that it was rectified.

1337
01:39:58,465 --> 01:40:00,847
[SPEAKER_15]: But at this point in time, the gentleman's before us now.

1338
01:40:00,927 --> 01:40:03,129
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a motion with stipulations before us.

1339
01:40:03,249 --> 01:40:03,810
[SPEAKER_16]: Move the question.

1340
01:40:04,350 --> 01:40:06,872
[SPEAKER_16]: So the motion, question has been moved.

1341
01:40:08,033 --> 01:40:08,874
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1342
01:40:09,355 --> 01:40:09,515
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1343
01:40:10,776 --> 01:40:11,116
[SPEAKER_16]: Opposed?

1344
01:40:11,576 --> 01:40:11,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Opposed.

1345
01:40:11,937 --> 01:40:12,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Opposition.

1346
01:40:12,798 --> 01:40:13,298
[SPEAKER_16]: Opposition.

1347
01:40:13,318 --> 01:40:16,120
[SPEAKER_16]: The clerk, the chair is uncertain.

1348
01:40:16,140 --> 01:40:17,542
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Clerk, will you please call the roll?

1349
01:40:24,463 --> 01:40:25,183
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Camuso?

1350
01:40:25,263 --> 01:40:25,503
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1351
01:40:26,144 --> 01:40:26,864
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Cavillo?

1352
01:40:26,904 --> 01:40:27,284
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1353
01:40:27,604 --> 01:40:28,104
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight?

1354
01:40:28,244 --> 01:40:28,524
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1355
01:40:29,505 --> 01:40:30,405
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Lugo-Kern?

1356
01:40:30,465 --> 01:40:30,705
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

1357
01:40:31,305 --> 01:40:31,885
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks?

1358
01:40:32,125 --> 01:40:32,405
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1359
01:40:32,826 --> 01:40:33,426
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Penta?

1360
01:40:33,486 --> 01:40:33,726
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1361
01:40:34,846 --> 01:40:35,626
[SPEAKER_14]: President De La Russa?

1362
01:40:36,147 --> 01:40:36,447
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1363
01:40:37,567 --> 01:40:39,768
[SPEAKER_08]: A vote of five in the affirmative, two in the negative.

1364
01:40:39,828 --> 01:40:49,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Let the record reflect the reason why I, and I believe my council colleague, voted no was because of the impending review of the traffic law, I mean the tax.

1365
01:40:49,571 --> 01:40:51,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Penta, so noted.

1366
01:40:51,671 --> 01:40:53,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Next week, you'll see in your package here,

1367
01:40:54,434 --> 01:40:59,640
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll be meeting- I'll call the vote with the five in the affirmative, two in the negative.

1368
01:41:00,260 --> 01:41:04,285
[SPEAKER_16]: License is granted with the stipulations agreed upon.

1369
01:41:05,186 --> 01:41:07,829
[SPEAKER_16]: Counselor Caviello, you have an informational piece for us?

1370
01:41:07,849 --> 01:41:09,230
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry?

1371
01:41:09,851 --> 01:41:10,752
[SPEAKER_16]: Counselor Caviello.

1372
01:41:12,674 --> 01:41:13,775
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll wait for that Mr. President.

1373
01:41:14,136 --> 01:41:14,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1374
01:41:23,584 --> 01:41:26,945
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion of Councilor Caviello to resort to the regular order of business.

1375
01:41:27,005 --> 01:41:27,566
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1376
01:41:27,606 --> 01:41:30,107
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

1377
01:41:30,127 --> 01:41:31,927
[SPEAKER_16]: 15-081 offered by Councilor Marks.

1378
01:41:32,668 --> 01:41:51,415
[SPEAKER_16]: Whereas council resolution 15-043 amended by Councilor Marks requesting that the city solicitor report back to the council if a change to the current parking plan allowed 15 to 30 minutes free parking and all business districts would fall under the purview of the traffic commission and

1379
01:41:52,075 --> 01:42:02,117
[SPEAKER_16]: Whereas the city solicitor's opinion stated, it is within the jurisdiction of the Traffic Commission to change the 15 to 30 minute free parking and also to change times of enforcement.

1380
01:42:02,617 --> 01:42:20,340
[SPEAKER_16]: Then be it resolved that the Medford City Council seek a letter, send a letter to the Traffic Commission requesting that 15 to 30 minute free parking be implemented citywide in the interest of addressing resident and business owner concerns.

1381
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:21,460
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Marks.

1382
01:42:22,228 --> 01:42:23,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1383
01:42:23,729 --> 01:42:31,894
[SPEAKER_06]: We received a letter in our packet, a legal opinion from City Solicitor Rumley, and last week's packet dated February 17th.

1384
01:42:33,095 --> 01:42:50,586
[SPEAKER_06]: It was in regard to paper 15-043, and the resolution that I offered, which many members behind this reeling have offered in the past, was to allow for 15

1385
01:42:51,878 --> 01:42:55,419
[SPEAKER_06]: slash 30 minute free parking in our business districts.

1386
01:42:56,139 --> 01:43:17,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, at the time, uh, when it was mentioned by many members of this council and supported by this council unanimously on several occasions, uh, that, uh, we, uh, weren't aware whether the traffic commission, because there is contractual language that exists right now between the city of method and Republic, which does our, uh, parking program, um,

1387
01:43:19,128 --> 01:43:36,337
[SPEAKER_06]: whether or not we needed to amend the contract or whether the traffic commission, which is a city commission, had the authority under its jurisdiction to vote for 15 or 30 minute free parking in the business districts.

1388
01:43:37,197 --> 01:43:47,142
[SPEAKER_06]: City solicitor responded back in the letter and quite clearly stated it's under the jurisdiction of the traffic commission to change the 15 to 30 minute free parking

1389
01:43:49,028 --> 01:43:50,849
[SPEAKER_06]: and also the times of enforcement.

1390
01:43:51,349 --> 01:43:59,793
[SPEAKER_06]: And as we all know, several weeks back, the Traffic Commission voted to change the enforcement times from 7 a.m.

1391
01:44:00,133 --> 01:44:00,893
[SPEAKER_06]: to 8 p.m.

1392
01:44:02,674 --> 01:44:04,275
[SPEAKER_06]: to 8 a.m.

1393
01:44:04,395 --> 01:44:05,775
[SPEAKER_06]: to 6 p.m.

1394
01:44:08,477 --> 01:44:11,398
[SPEAKER_08]: When was that supposed to become effective?

1395
01:44:11,418 --> 01:44:12,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that's the calls I'm getting.

1396
01:44:13,339 --> 01:44:15,059
[SPEAKER_08]: When does the 8 to 6 become effective?

1397
01:44:17,348 --> 01:44:18,268
[SPEAKER_06]: I honestly don't know.

1398
01:44:18,348 --> 01:44:23,811
[SPEAKER_06]: I assume once the vote was taken, it becomes effective and they did take the vote on it several weeks back.

1399
01:44:24,331 --> 01:44:28,272
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we'd have to get a clarification from the traffic commission.

1400
01:44:28,932 --> 01:44:41,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but so that the hours of operation has changed and I'm requesting, um, that, uh, we provide, uh, free parking at least 15 to 30 minute free parking in our business districts.

1401
01:44:42,065 --> 01:45:05,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Many business members that I've spoken to, I've heard them loud and clear that this would alleviate a bulk, not all concerns, but a bulk of the concerns for people running in and doing the quick errand, people running in and getting a sandwich in a sub shop, people running in and doing business in their insurance company, people running into the corner store and maybe playing a number.

1402
01:45:07,179 --> 01:45:09,160
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of different reasons, getting a newspaper.

1403
01:45:09,661 --> 01:45:18,226
[SPEAKER_06]: This would alleviate a lot of the people that are just running into the stores for a quick time, and there's no need to feed the meter.

1404
01:45:18,647 --> 01:45:27,873
[SPEAKER_06]: For those that want to stay for an extended period of time, 30 minutes or over, then there would be a need after that to feed the meter.

1405
01:45:29,394 --> 01:45:31,455
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this will help businesses.

1406
01:45:31,955 --> 01:45:35,878
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it will help residents that I've been hearing from also that would

1407
01:45:36,282 --> 01:45:51,688
[SPEAKER_06]: love to be able to go down into any of our squares, park briefly, do their business, and move on with their daily lives, not having to worry to go up to the kiosk and feed the kiosk, Mr. President.

1408
01:45:52,088 --> 01:46:05,233
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would ask that we take a vote in this simple request, requesting that the Traffic Commission at their next meeting take up the issue of 15- to 30-minute free parking.

1409
01:46:05,989 --> 01:46:22,512
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason why it was worded 15 to 30 minutes, I know the resolutions before this council, I know Councilor Lungo has offered it, I believe Councilor Camuso, Councilor Penta, and, you know, we've all mentioned different times, 15, 30 minutes, but ultimately they're going to make the decision.

1410
01:46:22,952 --> 01:46:34,114
[SPEAKER_06]: So if they decide, you know, they might want to do 45 minutes, but I think at least if we put a time in there, 15 to 30 minutes, it gives them a starting block, Mr. President.

1411
01:46:34,545 --> 01:46:42,010
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would request that this be sent to the Traffic Commission for their immediate review and hopefully approval, Mr. President.

1412
01:46:42,510 --> 01:46:45,993
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Councilor Marks, all those in favor, Councilor Knight.

1413
01:46:46,994 --> 01:46:48,354
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1414
01:46:48,615 --> 01:46:50,916
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Marks, thank you for bringing this resolution forward.

1415
01:46:50,956 --> 01:46:58,101
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that it's appropriate, directs the question to the proper forum, the proper board and commission that is the authority to make these decisions.

1416
01:46:58,862 --> 01:47:00,643
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much for bringing this forward.

1417
01:47:01,725 --> 01:47:05,108
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to amend the paper, Mr. President, by way of a B paper.

1418
01:47:05,708 --> 01:47:11,392
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would also like to make a request that the convenience fee of $0.35 be waived on all online transactions.

1419
01:47:12,313 --> 01:47:19,799
[SPEAKER_15]: I've said from the start that that's been a sticking point of mine where you could actually pay for $0.50 of parking and have $0.70 of fees associated with it.

1420
01:47:19,859 --> 01:47:25,603
[SPEAKER_15]: So, no question, $1.20 to park for a half an hour and $0.50 worth of parking, Mr. President.

1421
01:47:25,623 --> 01:47:28,665
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I'd ask that the paper be amended by way of a B paper.

1422
01:47:29,085 --> 01:47:35,771
[SPEAKER_15]: that would request that the Traffic Commission look into waiving the convenience fee of $0.35 for online transactions when using the park mobile app.

1423
01:47:41,836 --> 01:47:43,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a quick point of information.

1424
01:47:43,437 --> 01:47:47,680
[SPEAKER_06]: The convenience fee, is that contractual or is that something that's not?

1425
01:47:48,161 --> 01:47:49,222
[SPEAKER_06]: We got word on that already?

1426
01:47:49,242 --> 01:47:55,707
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe the convenience fee was something that was arranged between the third party vendor and Republic.

1427
01:47:57,273 --> 01:48:00,235
[SPEAKER_15]: It's passed on to the consumer, but it's outside the contract with the city.

1428
01:48:00,295 --> 01:48:01,296
[SPEAKER_15]: That's my understanding.

1429
01:48:01,316 --> 01:48:01,476
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1430
01:48:02,717 --> 01:48:04,238
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't, I have no problem asking.

1431
01:48:04,258 --> 01:48:07,201
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a good suggestion, but as long as it's not part of the contract.

1432
01:48:07,701 --> 01:48:08,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1433
01:48:08,061 --> 01:48:08,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Counselors.

1434
01:48:08,802 --> 01:48:10,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Counselor Pinto real quick on the convenience fee.

1435
01:48:10,723 --> 01:48:18,029
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was, um, uh, mighty Walsh, the mayor of Boston who was trying to, um, and I believe they have the same system that we have there.

1436
01:48:18,149 --> 01:48:19,750
[SPEAKER_08]: They're negotiating for 12 and a half cents.

1437
01:48:19,811 --> 01:48:24,294
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe rather than 35 cents that's presently out there, but that's neither here or there.

1438
01:48:24,767 --> 01:48:27,488
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe we're dating back to January 16th of this past year.

1439
01:48:27,988 --> 01:48:36,610
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the members on the commission, um, Mrs. DeLorenzo, I, you know, I think it was subsequent to the council's request to change this to eight to six.

1440
01:48:37,390 --> 01:48:48,852
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was sent to, um, uh, council, you know, Mr. Rumbly on February 3rd, a solicitor did render an opinion and he did run her opinion basically saying that it falls within the purview of the traffic commission.

1441
01:48:49,192 --> 01:48:53,033
[SPEAKER_08]: But he makes a very interesting note on the second page of his, of his opinion.

1442
01:48:53,663 --> 01:49:09,754
[SPEAKER_08]: He states, as to the effect of the regulatory rate changes on the contract, quote, substantial change, that impedes or enhances enforcement may result in a negative or positive impact on percentage payments that may be due under the contract.

1443
01:49:10,294 --> 01:49:14,637
[SPEAKER_08]: The same is true for substantial reduction or increase on parking spaces.

1444
01:49:15,157 --> 01:49:22,082
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and I believe, again, the argument that was brought up, or our issue was brought up in discussion,

1445
01:49:22,688 --> 01:49:24,929
[SPEAKER_08]: And that from 7 to 7, you're going from 8 to 6.

1446
01:49:25,790 --> 01:49:27,691
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a substantial change in the contract.

1447
01:49:27,771 --> 01:49:34,074
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe it was you, Councilor Caviello, I believe, who asked for the review after the first 60 days.

1448
01:49:34,934 --> 01:49:41,998
[SPEAKER_08]: And within that 60 days, we're going to have an idea just where they're going, what revenues or lack thereof with the change of this.

1449
01:49:42,058 --> 01:49:47,220
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they consider this to be a substantial change in the contract, this is going to have to be reviewed a step further.

1450
01:49:48,161 --> 01:49:51,382
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to just bring one other attention to this whole issue.

1451
01:49:51,462 --> 01:49:52,423
[SPEAKER_08]: During this past week,

1452
01:49:54,419 --> 01:49:58,802
[SPEAKER_08]: I received the following points of concern from residents.

1453
01:49:58,902 --> 01:50:12,693
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a lady who walked in Medford square in the CVS and she went to go put the money in the meter and she fell down and she had to be rushed to the Lawrence Memorial Hospital because of, because of just trying to get to the meter where the snow bank was.

1454
01:50:13,493 --> 01:50:22,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Also in an area that we were told that Republic was going to be apprised as to what's going on, I believe during the past two weeks,

1455
01:50:22,777 --> 01:50:24,938
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a funeral that took place at St.

1456
01:50:24,978 --> 01:50:26,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Joseph's Church on High Street.

1457
01:50:27,519 --> 01:50:33,201
[SPEAKER_08]: And when the folks came out that went to the funeral mass, their cars were all ticketed and tagged.

1458
01:50:33,281 --> 01:50:39,843
[SPEAKER_08]: And apparently the good father over there had to go down to the police department or Republic to get that resolved.

1459
01:50:40,923 --> 01:50:48,906
[SPEAKER_08]: The subsequent concern that came out of that, because they do operate on a Saturday, the priest's concern was, what if there's a wedding?

1460
01:50:49,747 --> 01:50:51,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Are those people going to be tagged?

1461
01:50:51,366 --> 01:50:53,267
[SPEAKER_08]: that go to church on Saturday on a wedding.

1462
01:50:53,807 --> 01:50:59,811
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe we were told by the Republic that once they knew what was going on, none of these people would be tagged.

1463
01:50:59,851 --> 01:51:02,012
[SPEAKER_08]: And here it is, they just got tagged two weeks ago.

1464
01:51:02,633 --> 01:51:12,919
[SPEAKER_08]: And then during this past Sunday, in the bulletin of the church, there is a notation as it relates to the collaboration of the churches between St.

1465
01:51:12,959 --> 01:51:13,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Joseph's and St.

1466
01:51:13,699 --> 01:51:14,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Francis.

1467
01:51:14,820 --> 01:51:19,963
[SPEAKER_08]: And because of the collaboration, they're going to use alternate dates, especially for the Feast

1468
01:51:21,170 --> 01:51:35,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Easter, but he indicates over here, we plan and underscore that the fact that we are now in a collaborative, but we also need to work around each parish's schedule and as well as the parking meter times that have become an issue of late.

1469
01:51:36,657 --> 01:51:48,823
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, we were told that this was not going to be a problem for the churches and for them to put it into the bulletin, having not only a problem already exist, it's obvious that Republic just has not gotten the message.

1470
01:51:49,724 --> 01:51:58,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Once again, last week I introduced pictures of Republic driving down the street, not having properly marked notices on their car, supposed to be in the back.

1471
01:51:59,030 --> 01:52:01,852
[SPEAKER_08]: All they had was, all they have now was just a P on the door.

1472
01:52:02,132 --> 01:52:05,374
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no telephone number, there's no identification of who they are or what they are.

1473
01:52:05,815 --> 01:52:11,778
[SPEAKER_08]: So I really think there are some serious infractions in this particular contract that they have here with the city of Medford.

1474
01:52:12,139 --> 01:52:18,363
[SPEAKER_16]: And also- I don't want to interrupt you, but my question, if I could from the chair, as I'm going through our,

1475
01:52:19,260 --> 01:52:23,483
[SPEAKER_16]: replies, I see nothing of the concerns you raised last week were not replied to.

1476
01:52:23,503 --> 01:52:23,823
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

1477
01:52:24,143 --> 01:52:24,643
[SPEAKER_16]: Am I correct?

1478
01:52:24,703 --> 01:52:24,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1479
01:52:25,644 --> 01:52:27,125
[SPEAKER_08]: I have not seen anything there yet either.

1480
01:52:27,445 --> 01:52:28,045
[SPEAKER_08]: So why?

1481
01:52:28,606 --> 01:52:29,126
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1482
01:52:29,226 --> 01:52:32,748
[SPEAKER_08]: But the fact of the matter is now, I think it's now been bumped up and escalated.

1483
01:52:33,229 --> 01:52:48,238
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have one of the churches in our community expressing not only a problem, not only a problem with a funeral, potential problem for a wedding, and now putting it in the bulletin that addresses a community of over 9,700 people, which make up the parish of St.

1484
01:52:48,258 --> 01:52:48,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Joe's,

1485
01:52:49,705 --> 01:52:55,327
[SPEAKER_08]: and relative to the meat is becoming an issue, the lady falling down in Meffitt Square having to be taken by an ambulance.

1486
01:52:56,047 --> 01:53:15,054
[SPEAKER_08]: I just really think that this program really is not business friendly, it's not friendly to the community, and hopefully Councilor Caviello, when the 60 days are up, we will have numbers to work on, and as far as I'm concerned, I would make a determination that we opt out of this whole program.

1487
01:53:15,374 --> 01:53:17,255
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be the best money the city ever paid,

1488
01:53:17,628 --> 01:53:19,969
[SPEAKER_08]: and bring a city back to some sense of normalcy.

1489
01:53:20,709 --> 01:53:21,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councillor.

1490
01:53:21,509 --> 01:53:22,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Councillor Kerrio.

1491
01:53:22,870 --> 01:53:24,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1492
01:53:24,330 --> 01:53:32,233
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that this doesn't go to the paper that we're talking about, but a few weeks ago, we asked about posting of the times on these meters.

1493
01:53:33,053 --> 01:53:34,234
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're not shutting off.

1494
01:53:34,454 --> 01:53:36,774
[SPEAKER_03]: They're supposed to shut off at a certain time.

1495
01:53:38,175 --> 01:53:40,236
[SPEAKER_03]: But these machines are going all night.

1496
01:53:40,576 --> 01:53:42,096
[SPEAKER_03]: People are putting money in there on Sundays.

1497
01:53:42,136 --> 01:53:42,816
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't know when.

1498
01:53:43,117 --> 01:53:44,237
[SPEAKER_03]: And they said they were going to come

1499
01:53:44,833 --> 01:53:47,014
[SPEAKER_03]: and put the hours of operation on every meter.

1500
01:53:47,334 --> 01:53:49,934
[SPEAKER_03]: And as of now, nothing has been done.

1501
01:53:49,954 --> 01:53:55,096
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, I see people at eight, nine o'clock at night, putting money into the meters and it's taking it.

1502
01:53:56,096 --> 01:53:58,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Sundays too.

1503
01:53:58,917 --> 01:54:03,018
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had a storm recently every other day here and they're out there tagging.

1504
01:54:03,878 --> 01:54:11,920
[SPEAKER_16]: Then if we could make that an amendment to council Mark's paper as an inquiry,

1505
01:54:12,601 --> 01:54:13,842
[SPEAKER_16]: to receive a response.

1506
01:54:14,803 --> 01:54:19,345
[SPEAKER_16]: These were things that have been brought up weeks ago that we need to hear back on.

1507
01:54:22,528 --> 01:54:24,349
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight to the floor next.

1508
01:54:26,090 --> 01:54:27,431
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1509
01:54:27,991 --> 01:54:38,778
[SPEAKER_15]: Another issue that's been brought to my concern that the Traffic Commission should be able to help us out with would be the fact that Republic, when they were here, they represented to us that they'd be more than willing and happy and ready to go over to the Senior Center.

1510
01:54:39,312 --> 01:54:42,553
[SPEAKER_15]: and to conduct trainings with the patrons thereof.

1511
01:54:43,093 --> 01:54:55,856
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's been brought to my attention that although they've been over there once or twice in the past, they've yet to come over actually with the kiosk and do an actual virtual training with the kiosk there in front of people to touch and feel and get comfortable with.

1512
01:54:56,076 --> 01:55:06,599
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd also like to amend the paper further and ask that a training be set up at the senior center within the next 30 days, Mr. President, with a virtual kiosk present and available for the people to

1513
01:55:08,375 --> 01:55:09,595
[SPEAKER_15]: for lack of a better term, play with.

1514
01:55:10,435 --> 01:55:10,796
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1515
01:55:11,236 --> 01:55:11,596
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1516
01:55:11,676 --> 01:55:19,678
[SPEAKER_16]: So on the motion of, uh, counselor, uh, marks, uh, amended by councilor care of yellow and councilor night councilor Penta.

1517
01:55:20,218 --> 01:55:24,779
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to have my resolution on there also to, I mean, my amendment to that as it relates to the churches.

1518
01:55:25,219 --> 01:55:35,942
[SPEAKER_08]: So whether it's for a funeral and now for a wedding during the hours that they said that they weren't going to, uh, you know, and it's, it's obvious, you know, for them to put it in the bulletin, it's, it's presented itself as a concern.

1519
01:55:36,562 --> 01:55:37,702
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, Mr. President, you know,

1520
01:55:38,264 --> 01:55:47,569
[SPEAKER_08]: We were also told that at the parking commission, maybe three, four weeks ago, that all the city's parking lots would be three hours.

1521
01:55:49,230 --> 01:55:50,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing has been changed.

1522
01:55:50,691 --> 01:55:52,912
[SPEAKER_08]: No signage has been changed to three hours.

1523
01:55:54,013 --> 01:55:55,454
[SPEAKER_08]: And you still have signs.

1524
01:55:55,474 --> 01:55:56,314
[SPEAKER_08]: You can go down Main Street.

1525
01:55:56,594 --> 01:55:58,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Signs are bolted to the trees.

1526
01:55:58,075 --> 01:56:02,277
[SPEAKER_08]: It's ridiculous.

1527
01:56:02,338 --> 01:56:05,199
[SPEAKER_08]: This company is just not doing what it's supposed to be doing.

1528
01:56:05,239 --> 01:56:06,700
[SPEAKER_08]: It's quite obvious that the mayor doesn't care.

1529
01:56:07,148 --> 01:56:08,089
[SPEAKER_08]: He just signs a contract.

1530
01:56:08,129 --> 01:56:10,190
[SPEAKER_08]: He really doesn't care what the impact is, and it's obvious.

1531
01:56:10,771 --> 01:56:17,175
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just really think that there is something wrong with how this whole operation is basically taking place.

1532
01:56:17,355 --> 01:56:25,441
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a lady turn around and tell me, I believe on Governor's Avenue, they changed, by Carlene's over there, they changed the two hours to a 30-minute parking spot.

1533
01:56:25,481 --> 01:56:27,603
[SPEAKER_08]: The Traffic Commission approved it in their minutes.

1534
01:56:28,498 --> 01:56:31,979
[SPEAKER_08]: A lady went out there, and the guy was coming around the street and was going to give her a ticket.

1535
01:56:32,019 --> 01:56:32,759
[SPEAKER_08]: I said, what are you doing?

1536
01:56:32,779 --> 01:56:33,359
[SPEAKER_08]: She's only been in.

1537
01:56:33,460 --> 01:56:35,260
[SPEAKER_08]: She's only inside for 10 minutes.

1538
01:56:35,780 --> 01:56:36,100
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no.

1539
01:56:36,640 --> 01:56:37,201
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't tell me.

1540
01:56:37,221 --> 01:56:38,061
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I'm watching.

1541
01:56:38,141 --> 01:56:39,021
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm right there with her.

1542
01:56:40,182 --> 01:56:45,243
[SPEAKER_08]: So how do they make this arbitrary decision of who's going to be there if there's no way to determine it?

1543
01:56:50,785 --> 01:56:54,246
[SPEAKER_16]: So as amended by Counselor Penta for those inquiries.

1544
01:56:54,366 --> 01:56:54,886
[SPEAKER_16]: You're close.

1545
01:56:55,026 --> 01:56:56,006
[SPEAKER_16]: Counselor Caraviello.

1546
01:56:56,406 --> 01:56:57,087
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1547
01:56:58,623 --> 01:57:00,504
[SPEAKER_03]: We did ask one more thing, too, a few weeks ago.

1548
01:57:01,925 --> 01:57:04,526
[SPEAKER_03]: I was with Councilor Petra a few weeks ago at the MMA show.

1549
01:57:05,166 --> 01:57:06,547
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a white screen.

1550
01:57:06,807 --> 01:57:08,288
[SPEAKER_03]: The backlighting.

1551
01:57:09,048 --> 01:57:10,989
[SPEAKER_03]: These green backgrounds you can't see.

1552
01:57:12,490 --> 01:57:15,731
[SPEAKER_03]: And the gentleman from the company said it's not a big deal to change it.

1553
01:57:16,111 --> 01:57:17,892
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bit more money to change it.

1554
01:57:18,352 --> 01:57:20,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Put the white screen out there so people can see it.

1555
01:57:20,654 --> 01:57:23,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't see the screen, even during the day, never mind at night.

1556
01:57:26,156 --> 01:57:27,677
[SPEAKER_16]: As amended by Councilor Caviello,

1557
01:57:28,212 --> 01:57:30,152
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Pinto, Councilor Camuso.

1558
01:57:30,672 --> 01:57:31,093
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1559
01:57:31,133 --> 01:57:32,013
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1560
01:57:32,093 --> 01:57:39,674
[SPEAKER_25]: And, uh, I do support the main resolution and then Councilor Knight's, uh, amendment as well as, um, Councilor Pinto's.

1561
01:57:40,234 --> 01:57:51,176
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I know we're getting to the point where it's, um, we're getting some time under our belt with this new program, but we still really don't have good data.

1562
01:57:51,836 --> 01:57:55,957
[SPEAKER_25]: As the councilor mentioned, we've been on a snow emergency now for a couple of months.

1563
01:57:57,395 --> 01:57:59,095
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, people aren't parking.

1564
01:57:59,175 --> 01:58:04,316
[SPEAKER_25]: Once the snow's away, we can really look into making major changes to this program.

1565
01:58:04,956 --> 01:58:12,258
[SPEAKER_25]: But at this point, I don't see anything wrong with revisiting the 15 and 30 minutes free parking or something in the middle.

1566
01:58:12,878 --> 01:58:22,659
[SPEAKER_25]: And if they have to do it at the end of the parking, if that's the only way that the system in place will work, then it's something they should look at.

1567
01:58:22,779 --> 01:58:26,640
[SPEAKER_25]: But I just don't know how you're going to enforce the 15 minutes.

1568
01:58:26,680 --> 01:58:27,060
[SPEAKER_25]: But you know what?

1569
01:58:27,697 --> 01:58:32,118
[SPEAKER_25]: This is what you get paid for here at City Hall to figure it out, and I support the council.

1570
01:58:32,478 --> 01:58:33,678
[SPEAKER_25]: And make it work for the people.

1571
01:58:34,739 --> 01:58:35,959
[SPEAKER_08]: If we could, Councilor Pater.

1572
01:58:36,339 --> 01:58:43,520
[SPEAKER_08]: On the same thing, what Councilor Camuso just alluded to, whether it's 15 minutes or 30 minutes, you have spots in the city that's an hour or two hours, and there's no kiosks or anything there.

1573
01:58:43,901 --> 01:58:49,502
[SPEAKER_08]: So how do they make these judgmental calls by going down there and, you know, they're going to take the time and write every number down?

1574
01:58:50,102 --> 01:58:53,023
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I saw something interesting the other... It's all in the sky.

1575
01:58:53,043 --> 01:58:54,883
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I saw something interesting the other day.

1576
01:58:55,567 --> 01:59:00,549
[SPEAKER_08]: I was on Boston Avenue in the morning, and we saw the car going down the street.

1577
01:59:01,249 --> 01:59:06,791
[SPEAKER_08]: He was going down, how can you say, going towards Somerville on Boston Avenue.

1578
01:59:07,151 --> 01:59:17,835
[SPEAKER_08]: He was probably going down there to check out the people, and all of a sudden, he must have got a call, and he whipped his rear around, and he blew through that intersection at least 40, Councilman Marks was there, 40 to 50 miles an hour.

1579
01:59:18,135 --> 01:59:25,157
[SPEAKER_08]: He gave no credit, because going right back to what you said, they probably got a buzzer that went off, that the person in the two hours was already over and beyond,

1580
01:59:26,397 --> 01:59:32,722
[SPEAKER_08]: This makes no sense how they run this operation that there was no consistency and you know How do you give out a ticket to someone when it's not even?

1581
01:59:33,863 --> 01:59:49,476
[SPEAKER_08]: When it's a snow emergency these people should know what's going on They should read the newspaper or they should be tied into the weather report that talks about a snow emergency in the city It's just unfair On the motion of council marks as amended all those in favor.

1582
01:59:50,456 --> 01:59:52,118
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh Roll call has been requested

1583
01:59:58,563 --> 01:59:59,364
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Cavillo?

1584
01:59:59,384 --> 01:59:59,544
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1585
02:00:00,264 --> 02:00:00,784
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight?

1586
02:00:00,804 --> 02:00:01,024
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1587
02:00:01,745 --> 02:00:02,625
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Lowell-Kern?

1588
02:00:02,645 --> 02:00:02,765
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1589
02:00:03,386 --> 02:00:03,906
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks?

1590
02:00:03,926 --> 02:00:03,986
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1591
02:00:04,827 --> 02:00:05,307
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Penta?

1592
02:00:05,327 --> 02:00:05,427
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1593
02:00:07,848 --> 02:00:08,689
[SPEAKER_14]: President Del Rosio?

1594
02:00:08,889 --> 02:00:09,169
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1595
02:00:09,849 --> 02:00:11,530
[SPEAKER_16]: Seven in the affirmative, none negative.

1596
02:00:11,570 --> 02:00:14,672
[SPEAKER_16]: The motion passes.

1597
02:00:14,692 --> 02:00:17,093
[SPEAKER_16]: 15-082 offered by Councilor Marks.

1598
02:00:17,713 --> 02:00:25,358
[SPEAKER_16]: Be it resolved that the Federal Management Company, which oversees the management of the Riverside Towers, located at 99 Riverside Ave,

1599
02:00:26,517 --> 02:00:33,082
[SPEAKER_16]: be contacted requesting the heat in the hallways be turned up due to resident complaints.

1600
02:00:33,542 --> 02:00:34,183
[SPEAKER_16]: Councillor Marks.

1601
02:00:34,923 --> 02:00:36,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1602
02:00:36,424 --> 02:00:41,948
[SPEAKER_06]: I received two calls from residents of the Riverside Tower.

1603
02:00:42,589 --> 02:00:47,312
[SPEAKER_06]: They were concerned that the hallways seemed to be very cold.

1604
02:00:47,832 --> 02:00:55,438
[SPEAKER_06]: The residents called the management company and the management company told them that it's their protocol to keep the hallways between

1605
02:00:56,744 --> 02:00:58,064
[SPEAKER_06]: 62 and 68 degrees.

1606
02:00:59,345 --> 02:01:03,268
[SPEAKER_06]: The woman at the Riverside Tower asked me to go down.

1607
02:01:05,229 --> 02:01:06,850
[SPEAKER_06]: I went by on my own.

1608
02:01:06,870 --> 02:01:08,491
[SPEAKER_06]: I went into the building.

1609
02:01:09,071 --> 02:01:14,094
[SPEAKER_06]: I stood near, as we all know, the front door, which is accessed a lot, the Riverside Tower.

1610
02:01:14,675 --> 02:01:21,039
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was absolutely freezing after the second set of doors in that particular lobby area.

1611
02:01:21,299 --> 02:01:22,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they manage this chamber as well?

1612
02:01:24,550 --> 02:01:27,873
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if they manage this chamber, but it's about the same degree.

1613
02:01:28,573 --> 02:01:37,741
[SPEAKER_06]: And I did go on to a couple of the floors, Mr. President, and it seemed to be, I had a coat on too, and it seemed to be somewhat cold in the building.

1614
02:01:38,401 --> 02:01:50,151
[SPEAKER_06]: I contacted, I looked online and contacted the management company, federal management company, and I have to say, I got an email back immediately from Joseph Moscarello.

1615
02:01:50,691 --> 02:01:52,853
[SPEAKER_06]: He is the senior property manager for the building.

1616
02:01:53,632 --> 02:01:58,496
[SPEAKER_06]: And he also responded via email and phone call back to me.

1617
02:01:59,216 --> 02:02:03,979
[SPEAKER_06]: And he mentioned to me that he sent his maintenance person out to each of the floors.

1618
02:02:04,740 --> 02:02:08,923
[SPEAKER_06]: And they did notice that some of the floors were actually below 62.

1619
02:02:09,944 --> 02:02:14,587
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're going to try to rectify some of the concerns they're having with the heating system in there.

1620
02:02:15,087 --> 02:02:18,930
[SPEAKER_06]: He also mentioned to me, which I found interesting, was the front door.

1621
02:02:19,738 --> 02:02:23,301
[SPEAKER_06]: stays ajar when it opens automatically for 40 seconds.

1622
02:02:23,901 --> 02:02:28,725
[SPEAKER_06]: You can imagine every time someone comes and goes, and that door stays open for 40 seconds.

1623
02:02:29,146 --> 02:02:42,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Needless to say, they're going to look at the duration of the cycle on that particular front door and see if they can get it closed quicker without also providing some concerns with residents trying to access the building.

1624
02:02:43,236 --> 02:02:47,620
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do want to report, Mr. President, that Mr. Moscarello

1625
02:02:48,301 --> 02:02:49,722
[SPEAKER_06]: seems to be on top of the issue.

1626
02:02:50,502 --> 02:03:10,554
[SPEAKER_06]: He said that there would be improvements in the temperature in the hallways, throughout the floors, and assured me that if there were any concerns that the management company, like I said, Federal Management Company, would be more than happy to seek some type of

1627
02:03:13,243 --> 02:03:16,485
[SPEAKER_06]: a remedy for residents of that building, Mr. President, so.

1628
02:03:16,785 --> 02:03:17,605
[SPEAKER_16]: So your motion is?

1629
02:03:18,306 --> 02:03:28,671
[SPEAKER_06]: My motion is actually to place this, why don't we just receive and place on file.

1630
02:03:29,032 --> 02:03:29,332
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1631
02:03:29,632 --> 02:03:30,032
[SPEAKER_16]: For now.

1632
02:03:30,552 --> 02:03:32,273
[SPEAKER_16]: And seconded by Councilor Camuso.

1633
02:03:32,554 --> 02:03:33,334
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1634
02:03:33,754 --> 02:03:34,455
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

1635
02:03:34,835 --> 02:03:35,575
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion passes.

1636
02:03:35,635 --> 02:03:37,156
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for that good work, Councilor.

1637
02:03:37,176 --> 02:03:38,877
[SPEAKER_16]: 15-083 offered by Councilor Penta.

1638
02:03:43,093 --> 02:04:06,398
[SPEAKER_16]: Be it resolved that the city of Medford requests the federal EPA that since the proposed MS4 stormwater sewer system permit would require communities to institute more advanced stormwater testing, monitoring and management programs, but is completely silent on funding or mitigation of the additional costs to communities.

1639
02:04:06,978 --> 02:04:10,679
[SPEAKER_16]: And since there is no flexibility in the compliance portion of the requirements,

1640
02:04:11,261 --> 02:04:39,552
[SPEAKER_16]: And since communities are grappling with these huge financial challenges with preliminary projections to be in excess of $800,000 plus per year, per community, we asked the EPA to defer action on the submission of NOIs until municipalities have had the opportunity to engage the regulatory agencies

1641
02:04:40,002 --> 02:04:44,666
[SPEAKER_16]: in an open dialogue regarding these onerous and unaffordable permit requirements.

1642
02:04:45,326 --> 02:05:07,885
[SPEAKER_16]: The aggressive schedule that the EPA proposes for implementation of the MS4 program is unrealistic to provide permittees only 90 days to file their Notice of Intent, NOI, after their permit is finalized, and equally unrealistic to dictate that the Notice of Intent of the Stormwater Management Program

1643
02:05:08,383 --> 02:05:10,304
[SPEAKER_16]: must be complete within one year.

1644
02:05:10,765 --> 02:05:28,938
[SPEAKER_16]: Communities such as Medford would be forced to hire expensive environmental consultants for assistance to complete numerous elements of the program because of lack of staff and technical expertise from years of both state and federal cutbacks in granting grant funding and local aid.

1645
02:05:29,358 --> 02:05:34,382
[SPEAKER_16]: Hiring these consultants would require compliance with statutory procurement requirements

1646
02:05:34,966 --> 02:05:39,029
[SPEAKER_16]: and could be extremely time-consuming as well as costly.

1647
02:05:40,450 --> 02:05:52,798
[SPEAKER_16]: In the absence of EPA leadership on this issue, a number of Massachusetts communities are already combining messaging by forming stormwater coalitions.

1648
02:05:54,379 --> 02:06:01,024
[SPEAKER_16]: There are at least five such coalitions in eastern Massachusetts, serving over 58 communities, 85 communities,

1649
02:06:03,477 --> 02:06:09,341
[SPEAKER_16]: combining resources and expertise, trying to reduce the individual burden anticipated for communities.

1650
02:06:09,921 --> 02:06:32,115
[SPEAKER_16]: Whether Medford joins a coalition or not, it needs to urge the EPA to amend its approach and incorporate goals that are more realistically attainable and within the financial constraints of the current economic climate, or wait until adequate federal funding is available to ensure that these requirements do not translate into another harmful, unfunded,

1651
02:06:32,612 --> 02:06:36,594
[SPEAKER_16]: mandate on cities, towns, and taxpayers.

1652
02:06:37,254 --> 02:06:38,294
[SPEAKER_16]: Counselor Penta.

1653
02:06:38,394 --> 02:06:42,276
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I have a whole folder here on this whole idea of this MS-4.

1654
02:06:43,156 --> 02:06:49,619
[SPEAKER_08]: This has been around for maybe the last couple of years or thereabouts, maybe 2011 when it first came up.

1655
02:06:50,199 --> 02:06:55,101
[SPEAKER_08]: This mandate would put an absolute tremendous cost upon the city of Medford.

1656
02:06:56,002 --> 02:07:01,484
[SPEAKER_08]: And as a result of that, especially as the whole resolution recites itself,

1657
02:07:02,134 --> 02:07:03,975
[SPEAKER_08]: They're giving no help, no assistance.

1658
02:07:04,375 --> 02:07:05,056
[SPEAKER_08]: You're on your own.

1659
02:07:05,856 --> 02:07:10,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Whether the city of Medford, again, whether they want to join a coalition or not, it would be up to them.

1660
02:07:11,200 --> 02:07:24,549
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just think an $800,000, $900,000 hit on an annual basis for every one of the cities and towns to have to be looking at this right now, especially when we have unfunded retirement benefits that need to be paid.

1661
02:07:24,969 --> 02:07:30,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Just as tonight, just looking at the problem with the drugs and that's impact here in the city of Medford.

1662
02:07:31,412 --> 02:07:37,776
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is something I really think that the city of Medford needs to do, as other cities and towns are beginning to do.

1663
02:07:38,457 --> 02:07:40,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Send letters to the EPA.

1664
02:07:41,519 --> 02:07:44,441
[SPEAKER_08]: And they have an address in Boston.

1665
02:07:44,721 --> 02:07:46,322
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 5 Boston Square.

1666
02:07:46,923 --> 02:07:56,149
[SPEAKER_08]: But I also think that our federal state representatives, Catherine Clark, and Markey, and Warren, need to be on board with this.

1667
02:07:56,329 --> 02:08:00,352
[SPEAKER_08]: They're the first ones out there saying, oh, we've got to help the people and stuff like that.

1668
02:08:00,825 --> 02:08:03,487
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't help the people by giving unfunded mandates such as this.

1669
02:08:03,627 --> 02:08:05,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely, totally unfunded.

1670
02:08:05,848 --> 02:08:10,691
[SPEAKER_08]: And they have taken grants away that normally could have been used or would have been used for things such as this matter.

1671
02:08:11,231 --> 02:08:14,533
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I have no problem.

1672
02:08:14,653 --> 02:08:21,237
[SPEAKER_08]: It probably would be even more helpful if our city engineer was on board with this or our Department of Public Works.

1673
02:08:21,717 --> 02:08:28,401
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think at the outset, as a legislative body, as these other 85 cities and towns are doing, they're sending in these letters.

1674
02:08:28,461 --> 02:08:29,922
[SPEAKER_08]: And basically, you're just asking them

1675
02:08:30,242 --> 02:08:36,707
[SPEAKER_08]: to delay it until you're ready to put a practical program in place that cities and towns can take a look at and can see.

1676
02:08:37,588 --> 02:08:49,037
[SPEAKER_08]: The way this thing is set up right now, if you have a street sweeper that goes down the street, you can't even have that street sweeper anywhere near a gutter because of what it's going to be able to go in there, because that's part of the stormwater drain.

1677
02:08:49,437 --> 02:08:54,881
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a whole host of things that are implied with this, like I said.

1678
02:08:54,901 --> 02:08:56,222
[SPEAKER_08]: This has been going on.

1679
02:08:56,282 --> 02:08:57,203
[SPEAKER_08]: I have all this stuff here.

1680
02:08:57,868 --> 02:09:01,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, but this is really, that's the issue of the resolution is, is the gut of the matter.

1681
02:09:02,269 --> 02:09:07,610
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um, the point person, uh, well, the point person for the city would be the city engineer.

1682
02:09:07,630 --> 02:09:15,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause they're, and, and, uh, Paul gear, who happens to be the director of public works, but it's, it's an issue that the city just cannot handle.

1683
02:09:15,611 --> 02:09:18,232
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't have the personnel and they don't have the expertise.

1684
02:09:18,812 --> 02:09:24,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, they may be expertise enough to understand what needs to be done, but we don't have the tools to implement this thing.

1685
02:09:24,833 --> 02:09:26,093
[SPEAKER_08]: And we don't have any resources.

1686
02:09:26,395 --> 02:09:35,558
[SPEAKER_08]: that the federal government are now imposing upon cities and towns, where the federal government should be having these workshops, should be having cities and towns go there to understand it.

1687
02:09:36,158 --> 02:09:41,260
[SPEAKER_08]: And when you get your notice of intent permit, have it in more of a reasonable way, not 90 days.

1688
02:09:41,340 --> 02:09:43,701
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you have to have the whole program complete within a year.

1689
02:09:43,721 --> 02:09:44,221
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a cost.

1690
02:09:45,097 --> 02:09:45,598
[SPEAKER_08]: It's huge.

1691
02:09:45,618 --> 02:09:46,378
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 900,000 or thereabouts.

1692
02:09:46,398 --> 02:09:53,443
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a major federal administrative overreach of power, which is typified, I must say.

1693
02:09:53,463 --> 02:09:53,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1694
02:09:54,244 --> 02:09:57,566
[SPEAKER_08]: So I have no problem to take the resolution.

1695
02:09:58,547 --> 02:10:00,248
[SPEAKER_08]: We can work with it, add or subtract to it.

1696
02:10:00,708 --> 02:10:04,090
[SPEAKER_08]: But the EPA is in Boston at 5 Post Office Square in Boston.

1697
02:10:05,391 --> 02:10:12,016
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe that they are and they will accept comments as it relates to this.

1698
02:10:12,236 --> 02:10:13,717
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe the more comments they get,

1699
02:10:14,138 --> 02:10:16,539
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll have an understanding that we can't go forward with this.

1700
02:10:16,759 --> 02:10:26,082
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think it's also beneficial, again, that our federal delegation becomes on board with this, too, because they can say, well, it needs to be done.

1701
02:10:26,122 --> 02:10:27,282
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of things need to be done.

1702
02:10:27,922 --> 02:10:29,623
[SPEAKER_08]: But we've had so many unfunded mandates.

1703
02:10:29,923 --> 02:10:33,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Leave No Child Behind is one, which is an educational mandate.

1704
02:10:33,364 --> 02:10:35,244
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is something that's really huge.

1705
02:10:35,264 --> 02:10:36,585
[SPEAKER_08]: And this isn't just a one-shot deal.

1706
02:10:36,865 --> 02:10:37,705
[SPEAKER_08]: This is every year.

1707
02:10:37,725 --> 02:10:39,666
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to have to deal with this thing every single year.

1708
02:10:39,686 --> 02:10:42,247
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're going to have to buy the equipment and the tools and everything that goes with it.

1709
02:10:44,310 --> 02:10:46,572
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to, um, I don't know.

1710
02:10:46,592 --> 02:10:47,612
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you want to do with it?

1711
02:10:47,632 --> 02:10:56,639
[SPEAKER_08]: I, I would just like to send the letter off to the EPA and then just refer it upstairs and hopefully that the city administration does what they're supposed to do.

1712
02:10:57,480 --> 02:11:01,162
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, perhaps we should have a report back from the city engineer.

1713
02:11:01,182 --> 02:11:03,003
[SPEAKER_08]: You could do that.

1714
02:11:03,524 --> 02:11:09,228
[SPEAKER_16]: And then refer it to the mayor's office if it needs to go out under the aegis of the city of Medford.

1715
02:11:10,057 --> 02:11:24,846
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we could, uh, legislative bodies, administrative and legislative bodies, we have a mayor, other cities and towns have city managers, but they have been soliciting, um, commentaries from legislative bodies, which is councils as well as the administration.

1716
02:11:25,327 --> 02:11:31,090
[SPEAKER_08]: So it just adds to the impact of recognizing that there is a cost involved in getting to that cost.

1717
02:11:31,330 --> 02:11:32,571
[SPEAKER_08]: There's just no preparation.

1718
02:11:32,931 --> 02:11:34,132
[SPEAKER_08]: It's onto the cities and towns.

1719
02:11:34,532 --> 02:11:36,914
[SPEAKER_16]: So, uh, if we could then have, uh,

1720
02:11:37,571 --> 02:11:49,599
[SPEAKER_16]: the city engineer report back to the council as to the progress of this while at the same time, the council sending out its a request to the EPA counselor night.

1721
02:11:49,959 --> 02:11:51,280
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, thank you very much, Mr. President.

1722
02:11:51,320 --> 02:11:59,325
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's a great idea to have the city engineer report back to us as to where we are in terms of compliance, what the cost is going to be for the taxpayers here in the city of Medford.

1723
02:11:59,866 --> 02:12:05,089
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I think it's also important to take a look that if in fact this program is delayed, what effect it's going to have on our watershed.

1724
02:12:05,862 --> 02:12:10,785
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we have a lot of questions that need to be answered, Mr. President, and I certainly don't have a problem asking those questions.

1725
02:12:10,845 --> 02:12:14,327
[SPEAKER_15]: However, until those questions are answered, I'd be opposed to sending a letter off to the EPA.

1726
02:12:15,167 --> 02:12:18,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, the Watershed Association has nothing to do with this.

1727
02:12:19,490 --> 02:12:32,957
[SPEAKER_08]: This is an EPA mandate as it relates to our wastewater disposal and how it's going through, and whether it's through the – just how it's leaving the city, or all cities and towns.

1728
02:12:33,357 --> 02:12:35,338
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is something where 85 cities and towns

1729
02:12:35,770 --> 02:12:48,379
[SPEAKER_08]: have now, either through a coalition or independently, are asking the federal government to put a hold on this and waiting until appropriate federal funding is available to ensure that these requirements don't translate into a financial burden.

1730
02:12:48,779 --> 02:12:51,361
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no workshops being held up on this.

1731
02:12:52,102 --> 02:13:04,130
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm quite sure that our city engineer is aware of this, but like I said, this is now coming through after meeting and having this discussion and reviewing what

1732
02:13:05,023 --> 02:13:06,244
[SPEAKER_08]: 85 cities and towns are now doing.

1733
02:13:06,304 --> 02:13:09,305
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just, you know, we're not going to be novel on this.

1734
02:13:09,845 --> 02:13:13,426
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a direct approach of an unfunded mandate from the federal government.

1735
02:13:13,726 --> 02:13:19,588
[SPEAKER_16]: So then the answer to the question is that we're going to refer this to the city engineer for report back to the council.

1736
02:13:20,088 --> 02:13:23,249
[SPEAKER_16]: And then having heard that we'll then take further action.

1737
02:13:23,889 --> 02:13:29,491
[SPEAKER_08]: So on that motion and or the city council can take its own independent action after whatever she does.

1738
02:13:31,632 --> 02:13:31,992
[SPEAKER_16]: Excellent.

1739
02:13:32,682 --> 02:13:34,102
[SPEAKER_16]: On that motion, all those in favor.

1740
02:13:34,282 --> 02:13:34,582
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1741
02:13:34,782 --> 02:13:37,003
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed unanimously.

1742
02:13:37,863 --> 02:14:00,508
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, past 15 Oh, 84 offered by consulate Penta be resolved that the method that method resident Andrew Sano, a realtor with remax Andrew realty services of Medford and Stonium be congratulated on being named the 2014 Massachusetts realtor of the year by the Massachusetts association of realtors.

1743
02:14:01,160 --> 02:14:16,123
[SPEAKER_16]: This highly recognized professional business honor was bestowed upon Mr. Sano at the Massachusetts Association of Realtors' annual professional awards reception, which was held at the Massachusetts Realtors' annual meeting in North Falmouth.

1744
02:14:16,823 --> 02:14:17,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Counsel Penton?

1745
02:14:17,823 --> 02:14:26,184
[SPEAKER_08]: In June of 2014, Mr. Sano had his name placed in nomination for Retailer of the Year after he received the award of the Greater Boston.

1746
02:14:26,844 --> 02:14:29,765
[SPEAKER_08]: And the competition to become the Realtor of the Year

1747
02:14:30,452 --> 02:14:41,555
[SPEAKER_08]: put him into 15 real estate associations, and in competition with 20,000 individuals whose name came up for review for the particular purpose.

1748
02:14:41,755 --> 02:14:47,396
[SPEAKER_08]: If anybody does know Mr. Sano, he works at Remax in Medford Square, Remax Andrew Realty.

1749
02:14:47,976 --> 02:14:56,198
[SPEAKER_08]: He's completely dedicated not only to his job, to his family, but the whole idea of being a professional in this particular job.

1750
02:14:57,098 --> 02:15:00,339
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe anyone that knows him, especially in that office,

1751
02:15:00,800 --> 02:15:10,665
[SPEAKER_08]: They will tell you on a daily basis he lives, sleeps, and eats, being a good real estate person for whoever his client might be.

1752
02:15:12,086 --> 02:15:21,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, he's also well known in the regional area of realtors and the greater Boston leadership because of commitment to doing this.

1753
02:15:21,510 --> 02:15:27,193
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to have Mr. Sano come before the council, receive the award,

1754
02:15:28,131 --> 02:15:38,515
[SPEAKER_08]: for which was given out, I believe, this past December by the vice president of, I guess, the State of the Professional Awards reception this past December.

1755
02:15:39,136 --> 02:15:39,916
[SPEAKER_08]: And it would be nice.

1756
02:15:39,956 --> 02:15:44,858
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we seem to be blessed having certain business folks in this community.

1757
02:15:45,378 --> 02:15:53,121
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, most recently we just had Dr. Lepore receive a piece of legislation that was passed long overdue as it relates to

1758
02:15:53,588 --> 02:15:57,889
[SPEAKER_08]: wind instruments and helping to protect people not to get any diseases from using it.

1759
02:15:58,389 --> 02:16:08,212
[SPEAKER_08]: We have Victor Garrow, who made national acclaim by defending a person for 30 years and bringing justice to someone not being found guilty for a crime that he didn't commit.

1760
02:16:08,252 --> 02:16:10,973
[SPEAKER_08]: And here we have now a local realtor here in the city of Medford.

1761
02:16:11,413 --> 02:16:17,495
[SPEAKER_08]: We have three people from three different walks of life, and I just think folks like that need to be recognized.

1762
02:16:18,469 --> 02:16:25,073
[SPEAKER_08]: and let people know that in our city of Medford, there are many citizens of the year, and they come from many walks of life.

1763
02:16:25,554 --> 02:16:30,937
[SPEAKER_08]: So that being said, I'd like to have Mr. Clark, we can get in touch with Mr. Sano and have him come to a future council meeting.

1764
02:16:31,938 --> 02:16:32,839
Hi.

1765
02:16:32,979 --> 02:16:34,019
The council

1766
02:16:48,507 --> 02:16:56,171
[SPEAKER_16]: to congratulate state representative Paul J. Donato on being promoted to second assistant majority leader.

1767
02:16:57,212 --> 02:16:58,132
[SPEAKER_16]: Counselor Camuso.

1768
02:16:58,352 --> 02:16:59,733
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1769
02:17:00,293 --> 02:17:04,696
[SPEAKER_25]: As we all know, state rep Donato has done a great job delivering for the community here.

1770
02:17:05,276 --> 02:17:10,759
[SPEAKER_25]: And once again, he has been appointed a higher position.

1771
02:17:10,799 --> 02:17:14,781
[SPEAKER_25]: It seems like every two years, representative Donato has been moving through the ranks.

1772
02:17:15,301 --> 02:17:16,442
[SPEAKER_25]: So he just

1773
02:17:17,360 --> 02:17:21,122
[SPEAKER_25]: We've got one more promotion in the ranks of leadership, and for that I want to congratulate him.

1774
02:17:21,683 --> 02:17:28,967
[SPEAKER_25]: And hopefully this will allow him to bring more funding to Medford for all the projects that are so important to the quality of life here in our community.

1775
02:17:29,327 --> 02:17:36,792
[SPEAKER_16]: Congratulations to Representative Donato, who's undoubtedly one of the hottest working men or persons on Beacon Hill.

1776
02:17:37,152 --> 02:17:37,813
[SPEAKER_16]: Absolutely.

1777
02:17:38,593 --> 02:17:42,355
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Councilor Camuso for approval, all those in favor?

1778
02:17:44,437 --> 02:18:04,821
[SPEAKER_16]: Offered by Councilor Caraviello, be it resolved that the City Solicitor and Code Enforcement Officer report back to the Subcommittee on licensing if all taxi owners and companies are in compliance on the City of Medford Vehicle for Hire Ordinance, Section 90-37, Owner's License.

1779
02:18:05,221 --> 02:18:09,942
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Caraviello, and I notice you've also called for a Subcommittee meeting, if you want to share with us.

1780
02:18:12,143 --> 02:18:15,105
[SPEAKER_03]: All the owners are all going to be coming up for renewal, I think April 1st.

1781
02:18:15,585 --> 02:18:28,113
[SPEAKER_03]: So along with the help from the clerk and the solicitor, every two weeks, I mean every week, the committee will bring in two different taxing companies along with some way bills in the form of the new rules that we'll be having.

1782
02:18:28,773 --> 02:18:33,516
[SPEAKER_03]: And hopefully we'll get some rules in place and move on with this.

1783
02:18:34,517 --> 02:18:35,337
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Counselor.

1784
02:18:35,397 --> 02:18:36,178
[SPEAKER_25]: Counselor Camuso.

1785
02:18:36,498 --> 02:18:36,698
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

1786
02:18:37,390 --> 02:18:41,033
[SPEAKER_25]: I think this is something we should also have Bill Timmons get involved with.

1787
02:18:41,693 --> 02:18:44,035
[SPEAKER_25]: This is actually a part of his job he should be doing.

1788
02:18:44,596 --> 02:18:57,987
[SPEAKER_25]: So if maybe we could get him there for, um, for this very important meeting, uh, I'd like to make sure he's part of this cause we all know, uh, he can issue fines as well as he's the person that certifies the meters every April.

1789
02:18:58,947 --> 02:19:03,371
[SPEAKER_25]: Uh, so he's a front and center and more importantly, he's had dealings with all these,

1790
02:19:04,984 --> 02:19:17,111
[SPEAKER_25]: companies and licenses, so we want to get some input from him on the way they're doing their business and if he feels that they're a reputable business to continue within the confines of our community.

1791
02:19:18,852 --> 02:19:20,013
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you for a good council.

1792
02:19:20,033 --> 02:19:20,573
[SPEAKER_25]: Councillor Knight.

1793
02:19:21,354 --> 02:19:22,715
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1794
02:19:23,763 --> 02:19:26,705
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to commend Councillor Caviello on tackling this issue.

1795
02:19:27,625 --> 02:19:34,889
[SPEAKER_15]: In my time on the Council, we've had a lot of discussion about taxi licenses, about the ordinance that's in place, about whether or not it's outdated.

1796
02:19:35,249 --> 02:19:45,154
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that an appropriate first step would be auditing these companies to determine where they're in compliance and where they're in non-compliance so that we can move forward and develop a comprehensive ordinance and make some changes.

1797
02:19:45,675 --> 02:19:53,399
[SPEAKER_15]: The city clerks work very hard on putting something together that mirrors what they've done in Brookline, which seems to be a rather extensive and comprehensive ordinance.

1798
02:19:53,935 --> 02:20:03,143
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that Councilor Caviello's course of action is an appropriate one where we'll meet weekly or bi-weekly in order to hash this out and get it wrapped up hopefully before the end of the legislative session, Mr. President.

1799
02:20:03,183 --> 02:20:04,324
[SPEAKER_16]: But I stand in full support.

1800
02:20:04,844 --> 02:20:05,184
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1801
02:20:05,244 --> 02:20:06,145
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1802
02:20:06,225 --> 02:20:09,348
[SPEAKER_16]: And on the motion for approval by Councilor Caviello, all those in favor?

1803
02:20:09,848 --> 02:20:10,569
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

1804
02:20:10,649 --> 02:20:11,970
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion passes.

1805
02:20:13,171 --> 02:20:13,751
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we get everything?

1806
02:20:16,413 --> 02:20:16,814
[SPEAKER_16]: Records.

1807
02:20:17,815 --> 02:20:18,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Penta.

1808
02:20:19,616 --> 02:20:21,858
[SPEAKER_08]: In that packet, we received a letter from the mayor

1809
02:20:22,390 --> 02:20:35,958
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, dated February 27th, as it relates to the, uh, um, the GIC situation that we discussed last week in the letter, um, they may have make some mistake on the right in the beginning, uh, plan design rest for GIC.

1810
02:20:35,998 --> 02:20:39,801
[SPEAKER_08]: There will be a voting on the rates on their upcoming March 3rd meeting.

1811
02:20:39,861 --> 02:20:41,942
[SPEAKER_08]: It isn't March 3rd, it's tomorrow, March 4th.

1812
02:20:42,743 --> 02:20:49,127
[SPEAKER_08]: And for those who might be interested in this March 4th meeting, which is tomorrow, and I believe it's at eight 15 or between eight 15, eight 30,

1813
02:20:51,101 --> 02:20:53,862
[SPEAKER_08]: You can attend the meeting, but they're not going to allow public comment.

1814
02:20:54,383 --> 02:20:57,944
[SPEAKER_08]: So that unfortunately seems to set another tempo here.

1815
02:20:58,524 --> 02:21:04,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Also in the letter, basically substantiates, I think, what we discussed last week, at least what I said.

1816
02:21:05,327 --> 02:21:13,490
[SPEAKER_08]: The unfortunate part of the GIC program, it's been intentionally underfunded for the past three years, and they never took it into any consideration.

1817
02:21:13,650 --> 02:21:18,052
[SPEAKER_08]: And when they were doing their budgetary process, the prior administration,

1818
02:21:18,523 --> 02:21:31,007
[SPEAKER_08]: They never took into consideration the additional people who were joining GIC and that the end of federal funds were not being forthcoming to the Commonwealth of Mass.

1819
02:21:31,688 --> 02:21:46,713
[SPEAKER_08]: So the cost of approximately $162 to $197 million is the cost right now, unfortunately, that GIC is going to be held accountable for to make whole this whole idea of those cities and towns that are in the GIC program.

1820
02:21:47,473 --> 02:21:56,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Another thing, another major change that they have made, it's going to go from an annual January to December to a fiscal year, which will be July 1st to June 30th.

1821
02:21:56,880 --> 02:22:06,446
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the keys in here is as follows, and I think it just segues itself into what we talked about last week, which is the following.

1822
02:22:06,466 --> 02:22:16,153
[SPEAKER_08]: It states, the GIC members can only change from an individual to a family or a family to an individual coverage with the qualifying event, which is marriage, birth,

1823
02:22:16,647 --> 02:22:31,454
[SPEAKER_08]: adoption of a child, change in the dependent eligibility, divorce, pursuant to subject matter chapter 32A, eligibility requirement, death of a spouse, dependent or a spouse, or dependence and voluntary loss of coverage elsewhere.

1824
02:22:31,974 --> 02:22:45,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, by having that, that one-time event, and coupling that with Harvard Health and Tufts going from a PPO to a POS, the next part that seems to be an unqualified issue

1825
02:22:45,605 --> 02:22:57,650
[SPEAKER_08]: is the fact that anyone who's in PPO and goes to a POS, whether it be in Tufts or Harvard, if you have a particular doctor in a particular hospital that are not in it, you cannot go to it.

1826
02:22:57,690 --> 02:22:58,570
[SPEAKER_08]: You lose that doctor.

1827
02:22:58,931 --> 02:23:00,031
[SPEAKER_08]: You lose that hospital.

1828
02:23:00,731 --> 02:23:10,896
[SPEAKER_08]: So what was said before is, while the 85-15 might stay the same, there is a huge, there will be a 6% to 12% increase.

1829
02:23:11,376 --> 02:23:12,276
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what it looks like.

1830
02:23:12,696 --> 02:23:13,977
[SPEAKER_08]: The projection is going to be

1831
02:23:14,527 --> 02:23:17,649
[SPEAKER_08]: at tomorrow's event for them to take the vote.

1832
02:23:18,769 --> 02:23:31,155
[SPEAKER_08]: This administration, the Baker administration, I believe, is committed to offsetting by a supplemental budget, getting close to that $192 million, which appears to be the magic number right now.

1833
02:23:31,556 --> 02:23:44,102
[SPEAKER_08]: But also, with that being said, the issue of whether, in fact, monies are going to be forthcoming in the future as it relates to offsetting that, that's going to be another issue unto itself.

1834
02:23:44,613 --> 02:23:52,414
[SPEAKER_08]: I think what needs to take place, and if I understand the gentleman who came here last week and indicated we're locked in until 2017.

1835
02:23:52,474 --> 02:23:56,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, the only thing that we're locked into is the percentage rate.

1836
02:23:56,035 --> 02:23:59,255
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not locked into keeping the rates what they are.

1837
02:23:59,736 --> 02:24:06,197
[SPEAKER_08]: The city of Medford, as well as each subscriber, is going to have to wind up paying for this in some shape, manner, or form.

1838
02:24:06,697 --> 02:24:14,278
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're a current employee, you're a retiree, a survivor, a school teacher, a policeman, a fireman, a municipal employee,

1839
02:24:14,743 --> 02:24:19,804
[SPEAKER_08]: are going to pay for this effective July 1st with the rates that will be forthcoming.

1840
02:24:20,665 --> 02:24:41,450
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the things that were brought up in discussion, and it was a point made really applicable by the Mass Teachers Association and the American Teachers Association, and their claim is quite candid, that they honestly feel that this whole health care cost, which is an outrageous cost, is being driven by insurance companies because

1841
02:24:42,295 --> 02:24:46,176
[SPEAKER_08]: The driving of these rates are going up because of the claims.

1842
02:24:46,856 --> 02:24:51,717
[SPEAKER_08]: And the claims are being predicated by people going to more expensive either hospitals or more expensive doctors.

1843
02:24:52,537 --> 02:25:10,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, when the program and the problem was being introduced, strike that, when the whole insurance issue was being introduced, I believe in 2011, for which the city of Medford jumped on board, effective July, January 1st of 2012, the whole idea was to reduce our insurance cost here in the city of Medford.

1844
02:25:10,761 --> 02:25:12,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's just talk about the city of Medford.

1845
02:25:13,272 --> 02:25:21,155
[SPEAKER_08]: And that would have worked very well, and I think everybody recognized the fact that their co-pays and their family costs were going to go up as part of joining this.

1846
02:25:21,235 --> 02:25:28,378
[SPEAKER_08]: But the city of Medford indicated that they would be saving approximately $25 to $26 million over a four-and-a-half, five-year period of time.

1847
02:25:28,959 --> 02:25:30,959
[SPEAKER_16]: Is this your presentation from last week?

1848
02:25:31,240 --> 02:25:37,882
[SPEAKER_08]: No, this is the presentation of today, attending the meeting that the governor was at, and we had this discussion.

1849
02:25:38,202 --> 02:25:38,863
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't mind, do you?

1850
02:25:38,923 --> 02:25:40,744
[SPEAKER_08]: It's information that is forthcoming.

1851
02:25:40,764 --> 02:25:41,724
[SPEAKER_08]: And as a result of that,

1852
02:25:42,175 --> 02:25:43,697
[SPEAKER_08]: This information is very important.

1853
02:25:43,717 --> 02:25:54,792
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyone who was on GIC here in the city of Medford, Unicare, that seems to be the difference between Tufts Health and what's the other one?

1854
02:25:54,812 --> 02:25:55,312
[SPEAKER_08]: I just forgot it.

1855
02:25:58,776 --> 02:25:59,656
[SPEAKER_08]: And what is the other one?

1856
02:26:00,637 --> 02:26:01,518
[SPEAKER_08]: I just forgot the other name.

1857
02:26:02,338 --> 02:26:04,600
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, anyway, Harvard Health, Tufts Health and Harvard Health.

1858
02:26:04,940 --> 02:26:17,029
[SPEAKER_08]: So the tradeoff is going to be your fees and costs are going to be higher in Tufts Health and Harvard Health, but Unicare may be at an issue where they might either be the same or they may go down.

1859
02:26:17,410 --> 02:26:24,115
[SPEAKER_08]: But the real major concern is anyone who has their PPO is going to go to a POS, you are going to lose

1860
02:26:24,777 --> 02:26:33,118
[SPEAKER_08]: If you lose your doctor or the hospital associated with it that you had before, and the PPO, and it's not found in the POS, then you cannot go to that doctor.

1861
02:26:33,138 --> 02:26:35,099
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to have to find another doctor in another hospital.

1862
02:26:35,539 --> 02:26:38,099
[SPEAKER_08]: So these are one of the diminishing things that are taking place.

1863
02:26:38,459 --> 02:26:43,880
[SPEAKER_08]: And now we're up to 60 communities, 60 communities that seem to be ready to jump on board.

1864
02:26:43,940 --> 02:26:45,040
[SPEAKER_08]: We were at 50 at the time.

1865
02:26:45,080 --> 02:26:46,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we're up to 60 cities and towns.

1866
02:26:47,141 --> 02:26:50,681
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, the argument is the larger the numbers, the lower the cost should be.

1867
02:26:50,741 --> 02:26:52,082
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's not working out that way.

1868
02:26:52,442 --> 02:26:53,662
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the big stumbling blocks

1869
02:26:54,299 --> 02:27:03,783
[SPEAKER_08]: The Patrick administration, for three years in a row, underfunded intentionally the liability that was necessary to be paid in that GIC program.

1870
02:27:03,843 --> 02:27:05,124
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's where we're at right now.

1871
02:27:05,704 --> 02:27:19,410
[SPEAKER_08]: So what started off as a $320 million deficit, when the Patrick administration said they were passing a budget that's current and it's level, it's now up to, I think, almost $900 million, a shade under a billion dollars.

1872
02:27:19,930 --> 02:27:23,312
[SPEAKER_08]: And these are one of the areas, unfortunately, that are being taxed.

1873
02:27:24,058 --> 02:27:38,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully, the mayor who was the negotiator in behalf of this can recognize the wherewithal to do something that offsets before 2017 no further increases that we would have to pay here in the city of Medford.

1874
02:27:38,226 --> 02:27:51,034
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what the relationship is between Harvard and Pilgrim with employees, retirees, and survivors as compared to Unicare, but that does and that will have an effect upon the city of Medford.

1875
02:27:52,514 --> 02:27:53,335
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councillor.

1876
02:27:53,820 --> 02:27:54,380
[SPEAKER_16]: The records.

1877
02:27:54,720 --> 02:27:55,721
[SPEAKER_16]: Wait a minute, Mr. President.

1878
02:27:55,821 --> 02:27:56,221
[SPEAKER_16]: Tabled.

1879
02:27:59,002 --> 02:27:59,402
[SPEAKER_16]: Records.

1880
02:28:00,003 --> 02:28:00,143
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1881
02:28:00,743 --> 02:28:02,083
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to leave the records for this week.

1882
02:28:02,824 --> 02:28:06,025
[SPEAKER_16]: Records of the tabled records of the February 17th, 2015.

1883
02:28:06,265 --> 02:28:07,746
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not me.

1884
02:28:08,006 --> 02:28:09,786
[SPEAKER_16]: Were passed to Councilor Karaviello.

1885
02:28:10,507 --> 02:28:12,608
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you have a chance to inspect those?

1886
02:28:12,748 --> 02:28:13,148
[SPEAKER_16]: I have not.

1887
02:28:13,228 --> 02:28:14,308
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll get that done next week.

1888
02:28:15,749 --> 02:28:17,029
[SPEAKER_16]: Then the motion to retable them.

1889
02:28:17,069 --> 02:28:17,730
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1890
02:28:17,770 --> 02:28:18,410
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

1891
02:28:19,170 --> 02:28:19,490
[SPEAKER_16]: February 24th.

1892
02:28:19,510 --> 02:28:21,011
[SPEAKER_16]: Records are retabled.

1893
02:28:21,371 --> 02:28:22,352
[SPEAKER_16]: Records of February 24th were.

1894
02:28:23,824 --> 02:28:27,548
[SPEAKER_16]: pass to Councilor Knight for inspection.

1895
02:28:28,709 --> 02:28:33,393
[SPEAKER_15]: But if Council President, Councilor Penta has an issue, I'll be happy to sit with them and talk about it and we can figure it out.

1896
02:28:33,433 --> 02:28:34,514
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll table them until next week.

1897
02:28:35,755 --> 02:28:39,019
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to table those records as well.

1898
02:28:40,180 --> 02:28:41,141
[SPEAKER_16]: Records are tabled.

1899
02:28:42,782 --> 02:28:47,627
[SPEAKER_16]: And on the motion of the Vice President for Lungo Kern, motion to adjourn.
