Paul Rousseau?

26
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,030
Present.

27
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:15,971
Paulette Vanderkloot, present.

28
00:02:16,091 --> 00:02:16,951
Mayor Lungo Kern?

29
00:02:17,331 --> 00:02:17,691
Present.

30
00:02:17,711 --> 00:02:18,992
Seven present, zero absent.

31
00:02:25,595 --> 00:02:27,376
So good evening, Madam Mayor.

32
00:02:27,436 --> 00:02:39,664
The presentation that was shared with the committee earlier this evening, I was gonna have Mr. Fallon, Mr. DeLava, as they're the two closest to it, walk us through it for the committee.

33
00:02:39,704 --> 00:02:41,705
Mr. Fallon is just coming in right now.

34
00:02:41,905 --> 00:02:46,648
So we'll get him up and just give me one second to adjust one other thing.

35
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,872
And screen share for you.

36
00:02:54,507 --> 00:03:03,860
Allen and Mr. Good evening.

37
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,722
Hello everyone.

38
00:03:06,483 --> 00:03:11,810
I think, Chad and I will piggyback back and forth on on this presentation.

39
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:23,222
Just before we get started, I know there's going to be discussions regarding, you know, the relaunching of the vision committee.

40
00:03:23,762 --> 00:03:36,586
There's been some things in the past that have been sort of set up and, you know, I guess some of the things we were talking about, are we talking about like renovations to the building or are we talking more vision stuff?

41
00:03:36,606 --> 00:03:41,627
But I think we're going to show you what we've currently done so far so that when you are making that decision of,

42
00:03:42,247 --> 00:03:51,657
where you're going or which direction you're going regarding what has been done recently at the high school, which many of you are already aware of, as well as at the vocational school.

43
00:03:52,418 --> 00:03:53,539
So we can go to the next slide.

44
00:03:59,044 --> 00:04:05,148
So, you know, some of the projects that you are aware of obviously, you know, the swimming pool had been redone.

45
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:08,990
A few years ago we just recently got the new gymnasium floor.

46
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:13,153
My first year here, the science labs were completed in 2014.

47
00:04:15,392 --> 00:04:21,597
Now with the COVID CARES Act money, things that have been improvement is our HVAC system.

48
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:30,985
We are still in working on the student bathrooms that are in progress and the new boilers that were funded by the MSBA grant.

49
00:04:34,117 --> 00:04:42,023
So as you can see here, little pictures of our swimming pool, as well as our floor that's partnered with Lesley University.

50
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,224
I know many of you have been there already.

51
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:49,848
So that's one thing that we are quite proud of that has been improved throughout the years.

52
00:04:50,368 --> 00:04:50,768
Move on.

53
00:04:54,951 --> 00:04:56,852
Now, you gotta be impressed with this.

54
00:04:56,912 --> 00:04:58,694
I was actually on the roof to get these pictures.

55
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:15,926
But I wanted to make sure that it was clear that the swap outs were just recently happening with our go green contractor that has been doing improvements for fans as well as air conditioning and air exchanges.

56
00:05:16,606 --> 00:05:21,768
So I wanted to make sure you got a picture of some of the units that have been already installed on the newer end.

57
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:29,570
If you look more to that left picture, you'll also see that the venting and the piping has been improved as well.

58
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:33,401
Next one.

59
00:05:34,882 --> 00:05:37,023
Many of you are aware of our science lab areas.

60
00:05:37,043 --> 00:05:47,369
Each science lab has a prep room area as well as a regular science lab area, which again, through MSBA grant funding that happened around 2014.

61
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:58,075
And then of course we have our biotech area that's part of the science lab as well that many of you have visited through the years.

62
00:06:03,936 --> 00:06:09,251
And Chad's going to take over on the vocational side I know you've seen some of this presentation before but.

63
00:06:10,525 --> 00:06:13,626
he's got more updated pieces to what he's been doing on the vocational side.

64
00:06:14,246 --> 00:06:14,766
Thanks, Paul.

65
00:06:15,406 --> 00:06:18,647
So I definitely am thrilled that I can beef up my resume.

66
00:06:18,687 --> 00:06:25,129
Not that I'm going anywhere, but who knew four years ago when I took this job, I'd be in my fourth or fifth project here in the high school.

67
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:25,830
So it's really cool.

68
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,090
I'm glad to be able to do it.

69
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:28,990
We have done a lot.

70
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:36,813
Every time we take on a project, though, I have to tell you, and I always make the joke with usually whoever's in my six-foot radius,

71
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:52,719
every time I do these projects I worry I like see this wrecking ball in my mind thinking with my luck I'll finish the new salon you know the marble was just put in and we'll get we'll get funding for a new school and in comes the wrecking ball and I'll be standing there guarding the marble that I that I took from the girls locker room

72
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:55,042
So it's always a risk.

73
00:06:55,623 --> 00:07:07,761
Luckily, all the work we do, we have been lucky, we have private donors, it's grant funded, a lot of the stuff we can take with us, but there are some things that obviously we're doing to the physical plant that can't be taken with us if we were to leave this building.

74
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:19,138
With that said, and getting to know the building more over four years and kind of seeing the structure when it's exposed, there are a lot of good, I do think it has good bones.

75
00:07:19,278 --> 00:07:23,441
I think the HVAC systems were something that were gonna need to be done regardless.

76
00:07:24,362 --> 00:07:26,763
Whether the building can last us another 50 years, I don't know.

77
00:07:26,843 --> 00:07:34,489
But the projects we're doing now are at least revitalizing the space, making it safe, making it up to code.

78
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:34,569
And

79
00:07:37,633 --> 00:07:39,994
Hopefully it will buy us some time.

80
00:07:40,854 --> 00:07:49,998
So a quick update, I did give this at the Buildings and Grounds Subcommittee, so I won't get into detail, but metal fabrication and welding was painted, walls and ceilings.

81
00:07:50,398 --> 00:07:51,619
That was a no-cost job.

82
00:07:52,119 --> 00:07:55,220
We have finished, at least for now, our LED lighting projects.

83
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,981
We were able to do five different programs.

84
00:07:57,021 --> 00:08:00,362
That was $100,000 plus in grant funding.

85
00:08:00,943 --> 00:08:02,723
That's also a cost savings to the school.

86
00:08:03,064 --> 00:08:04,744
So we have five of our programs with that.

87
00:08:05,225 --> 00:08:06,225
Paul, you can go to the next slide.

88
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,127
I'm not in control of it.

89
00:08:08,308 --> 00:08:11,009
Oh, sorry, Paul.

90
00:08:11,269 --> 00:08:13,670
Robotics and Engineering is fully complete at this point.

91
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,030
We have a very small punch list.

92
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:20,193
We have to do a few items before that's finished, but that space is very much inhabitable.

93
00:08:20,613 --> 00:08:22,594
That was through the Skills Capital Grant, $287,000.

94
00:08:22,874 --> 00:08:28,516
The final thing for the HVAC down there right now is to get the unit going in the classroom.

95
00:08:29,116 --> 00:08:33,058
We have new heat, and that also has windows and doors that open.

96
00:08:35,259 --> 00:08:35,419
Next.

97
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,306
just some more pictures of robotics, the finished product.

98
00:08:41,569 --> 00:08:49,534
In programming and web development, we moved that program to a bigger space, which was the former robotics and engineering program, spent about 16,000 on that.

99
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,775
Those are all items that could be moved if needed.

100
00:08:51,835 --> 00:08:54,137
That was through a partnership with the Furniture Trust.

101
00:08:54,677 --> 00:09:00,081
So 25 new workstations, new carpet, paint, and new computers that we bought through Perkins funding last year.

102
00:09:05,637 --> 00:09:14,543
In the former programming and web room, we made that a construction technology lab that will be shared by metal fabrication, construction and craft laborers in carpentry.

103
00:09:15,023 --> 00:09:16,524
The desks were built by the students.

104
00:09:16,564 --> 00:09:19,226
We used wood that was just made out of pine.

105
00:09:19,306 --> 00:09:20,467
It wasn't anything expensive.

106
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:24,109
And you can see that the teachers made a demonstration desk as well.

107
00:09:24,349 --> 00:09:30,273
We did this prior to COVID, but it actually lent itself well to our current situation because students aren't directly next to each other.

108
00:09:30,293 --> 00:09:32,295
Next slide, please.

109
00:09:33,257 --> 00:09:35,878
So the cosmetology salon is just about finished.

110
00:09:36,218 --> 00:09:39,819
These are some pictures of the process over the last year, really.

111
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,740
If you go to the next slide, I can show you where we're at now.

112
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,181
The floor will be finished by this week.

113
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:49,982
The marble from the girls' locker room has been retrofitted for this space.

114
00:09:50,582 --> 00:09:54,384
If you flip to the next slide, we can show you the current pictures.

115
00:09:55,964 --> 00:09:56,384
Dr. Cushing.

116
00:09:56,604 --> 00:09:57,084
Dr. Cushing.

117
00:09:57,925 --> 00:09:58,165
Thanks.

118
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:03,417
So much like we did in the bistro, we took more remnants of the marble that was in the locker room.

119
00:10:03,797 --> 00:10:09,460
And we did basically a 25 foot countertop, if you will, in the middle of the salon.

120
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,781
And that's gonna be 12 workstations for the students.

121
00:10:12,522 --> 00:10:14,803
We use the marble above the sink on that lower picture.

122
00:10:15,343 --> 00:10:17,264
And the picture in the middle is a picture of the floor.

123
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:24,668
And then the picture on the right is one of our instructors with students just last week, putting the fascia trim on the workstations.

124
00:10:27,436 --> 00:10:31,658
Automotive technology, this was really the stars aligned on this one.

125
00:10:31,678 --> 00:10:36,700
This was a combination of the students not being in the space allowed us to empty everything.

126
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:41,562
I shouldn't say we allowed the teachers to empty everything out of the shop, which was a huge project.

127
00:10:42,562 --> 00:10:44,143
This shop hadn't been touched in years.

128
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:49,365
And we put down a high grade airport quality floor down in that space.

129
00:10:49,425 --> 00:10:56,128
That would have been no doubt $100,000 job that we were able to get as no cost because of our partnership with the Painters Union.

130
00:10:56,988 --> 00:10:58,510
Sherman Williams donated the paint.

131
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:08,398
So really when all was said and done, the only thing I paid for was to have the ceiling painted by a contractor after the fact, because I didn't dare ask the painters union back.

132
00:11:08,518 --> 00:11:10,580
They were moving on to another project with the apprentices.

133
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,121
So we did that ourself.

134
00:11:12,602 --> 00:11:13,202
That was about $10,000.

135
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:17,566
So all I had to spend for this project was about $10,000 for the painting of the ceiling.

136
00:11:17,586 --> 00:11:19,348
If you go to the next slide, you can see.

137
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:27,155
So with the new lighting, the ceiling and the floor, the new lifts, automotive technology is now one of our newest programs.

138
00:11:27,215 --> 00:11:32,980
And last year with Perkins funding, we upgraded some machinery and products for the shop.

139
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,782
So now we're up to NATF standards in this program as well.

140
00:11:37,143 --> 00:11:37,363
Next.

141
00:11:38,084 --> 00:11:39,605
And that's an update from our side.

142
00:11:47,671 --> 00:11:48,692
Great, member McLaughlin.

143
00:11:51,352 --> 00:11:53,213
I just wanted to say it looks great, Chad.

144
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,114
Thank you very much.

145
00:11:54,194 --> 00:11:59,237
I got a little bit of a tour before COVID, and I was just so impressed.

146
00:11:59,257 --> 00:12:00,918
It had been my first time for a walk around.

147
00:12:00,998 --> 00:12:04,860
So it just looks so good, and it's exciting.

148
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,681
And I can't wait to see the salon all done.

149
00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:09,222
And I'm sure your students can't wait to get in there.

150
00:12:09,943 --> 00:12:10,983
Yeah, it's going to be nice.

151
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:11,744
Thank you for your support.

152
00:12:19,383 --> 00:12:22,005
Dr. Cushing, do you have another slide deck?

153
00:12:22,025 --> 00:12:27,669
That is the slide deck we have right now.

154
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:45,681
We have begun work on another slide deck to really look at how we would go about really setting a vision, the type of work that should be done to go through, kind of like Mr. DeLava was saying at the start, really establishing

155
00:12:46,984 --> 00:12:54,170
the vision for what we want Medford High School to be so that the physical structure then meets those needs.

156
00:12:58,593 --> 00:13:00,914
But I see Mr. Russo has his hand up.

157
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:03,676
Hi, thank you for the presentation.

158
00:13:03,736 --> 00:13:04,897
I have to admit confusion.

159
00:13:06,739 --> 00:13:11,862
It seemed that I wasn't on the agenda, so I was a little confused by that, but so

160
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:18,784
that all seems like really important information for the vision committee to consider when they do their work.

161
00:13:19,564 --> 00:13:23,045
And I'm glad that we have actually put it all together on a list.

162
00:13:23,265 --> 00:13:25,045
I think that that'll be helpful for them.

163
00:13:27,846 --> 00:13:40,570
Just wondering, so are we moving on to the policy to fill out the required six items that we have to hand off to the vision committee?

164
00:13:44,005 --> 00:13:45,745
So can I ask a question?

165
00:13:45,765 --> 00:13:46,606
Is that okay?

166
00:13:48,006 --> 00:14:02,589
Because the inception of the vision committee is where I, you know, I've gone through my previous emails and it really started under a different administration regarding building improvements.

167
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:08,570
And Mia, I know you're quoted actually in the press release as well as the application process.

168
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:10,191
for that.

169
00:14:10,211 --> 00:14:23,284
And I think what I'm trying to get a grasp on is, it sounds like we're reforming the vision committee, but we haven't set the actual standards for what that vision committee is.

170
00:14:23,945 --> 00:14:30,091
Because there was a selection that was made and then it was decided that we would reopen the application process.

171
00:14:31,576 --> 00:14:33,118
which totally is understandable.

172
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:40,369
I just, I think that's where the crux of where I am stuck as the principle of where this is going.

173
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:43,134
So I'm glad we're having this committee of the whole, cause I'm a little.

174
00:14:44,085 --> 00:14:45,406
And Paul, you're right.

175
00:14:46,006 --> 00:14:59,534
I think it was, well, now looking back, it was an oversight, because it was kind of Kathy and I transitioning, and Kathy was really the one who thought of a vision committee, and that's when she came on as chair of the buildings committee.

176
00:14:59,934 --> 00:15:12,061
So really, Kathy, I don't know if you, you probably remember better than I do, because it was the vocational teacher who had come up and has presented when the buildings committee, I think it was the last meeting we transitioned together.

177
00:15:13,076 --> 00:15:14,677
Yeah, it was Mr. Brown.

178
00:15:15,338 --> 00:15:20,522
It was actually his idea, and he proposed and shared some ideas.

179
00:15:21,223 --> 00:15:29,249
He reached out to me this week to see if I had a copy of his proposal, which I don't have it, but it was all great information.

180
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:39,597
And he actually has over, it looks like over, he has 35 years in the construction industry, seven years at Medford Vocational Technical High School.

181
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,200
He also has eight years in,

182
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,821
manufacturing and design.

183
00:15:45,782 --> 00:15:54,649
So, you know, he actually came up with the idea and shared some, you know, some like a brief presentation at that building and grounds meeting.

184
00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:58,952
And I have a copy of the minutes, but it doesn't have a copy of the proposal.

185
00:15:59,052 --> 00:16:00,553
Like I actually pulled out the minutes.

186
00:16:01,053 --> 00:16:07,338
I saved them, but I don't have a copy of his proposal, but I think it was more along, you know,

187
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:14,303
What were we gonna go, you know, were we gonna do renovations or was it going to be a new school?

188
00:16:14,664 --> 00:16:33,760
But I think like with everything going on right now, all the updates that are going on, including the HVAC and the boiler and all the vocational updates, you know, I think it might be best to go forward with this committee, you know, for a renovation for the high school, you know, almost like a refurbish the high school.

189
00:16:36,684 --> 00:16:43,446
And I think also the trouble that we had earlier was that, you know, we didn't have a diverse group.

190
00:16:43,866 --> 00:16:45,767
So that's why it was disbanded.

191
00:16:46,687 --> 00:16:58,911
And we need to just, I guess, the mayor and the committee, we just need to, I think, come up with an application process and maybe a lottery process to choose the very select, you know, diverse group.

192
00:16:59,991 --> 00:17:03,412
And that's what, you know, that's what I remember so far.

193
00:17:04,373 --> 00:17:05,273
Thank you, Member Kretz.

194
00:17:05,313 --> 00:17:05,753
Member Graham.

195
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:29,386
So I think when we disbanded this committee, we talked about the fact that, you know, one of the, you know, among the challenges in the way that the committee was formed is that we did not have a diverse cross section of residents participating, but that really that was because we weren't following our own rules about how to establish such a committee and

196
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:40,082
I think we need to go back to the beginning of that process and say, which is what we agreed we would do, and say, what is the scope of this committee that we're asking?

197
00:17:41,702 --> 00:17:44,263
And therefore, how many people do we need?

198
00:17:44,483 --> 00:17:45,743
And what is the time frame?

199
00:17:45,803 --> 00:17:47,264
And what do we expect from them?

200
00:17:47,304 --> 00:17:53,205
And what parameters are we providing to them so that they can then go off and do their exploratory

201
00:17:53,743 --> 00:17:55,483
work, whatever that work might be.

202
00:17:55,743 --> 00:18:08,045
But it would be hugely irresponsible of this committee to say, we just because we have done stuff in recent times that we shouldn't at least examine what all of our options are.

203
00:18:08,145 --> 00:18:14,366
Because when you are retrofitting a building, it is often far more expensive than something new.

204
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:20,187
Sometimes it's not, but none of us is qualified to make that decision, but none of us is qualified to make that decision.

205
00:18:20,247 --> 00:18:23,568
So we should, I think we need to proceed with

206
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,342
plans that we had in place to sort of examine those as options.

207
00:18:27,422 --> 00:18:35,127
So what Mr. Brown presented to us back at that meeting because I was in attendance was that there's really three options.

208
00:18:35,367 --> 00:18:39,570
One is to renovate in place and to do that a little bit at a time.

209
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:40,511
That's one option.

210
00:18:41,051 --> 00:18:45,834
The other was to build something new on site.

211
00:18:46,675 --> 00:18:51,298
So basically stand up a new structure and then ultimately the current one goes away.

212
00:18:52,038 --> 00:18:53,079
The third option was

213
00:18:54,404 --> 00:19:01,271
not to build on site at all, but to find some other site or location and explore what that would look like.

214
00:19:01,672 --> 00:19:11,001
And I think each of those three things at this point in time, based on what we don't know, are just as viable as the last thing.

215
00:19:12,133 --> 00:19:22,219
I think, you know, in terms of the scope of the committee, we need to not limit them and we need to, as a committee, not limit our thinking about how we're going to do this.

216
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:31,144
And I hear that all the time when the discussion of vision committee comes up is people say, well, we did this work six years ago, so we can't possibly consider doing something different.

217
00:19:31,684 --> 00:19:35,487
I think that's an expensive assumption potentially.

218
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,608
And I don't feel like we are,

219
00:19:38,204 --> 00:19:39,885
rolling in dough as a community.

220
00:19:39,985 --> 00:19:51,269
So we owe it to the community to make really astute, smart decisions about what's in the best interest of our vision, which we don't have at the moment, and how we get there.

221
00:19:51,469 --> 00:19:59,272
So I do think if we go back to the beginning of forming an advisory committee and talk about the scope, that will lead us to questions like,

222
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:19,841
just how big should the committee be, who should be on the committee, what kind of skills do we need, and then we can get to the point of how do we have an application process that allows us to ensure that we have a representative group of people on the various components of the committee to do the work that we have asked them to do.

223
00:20:21,169 --> 00:20:24,512
a framing of the work and an expectation of what we need from people.

224
00:20:24,632 --> 00:20:34,059
I think it's really hard to expect people to just blindly sign up for something where we can't say it's this many hours, it's this many months, it's this much time.

225
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:42,565
And I think there's a lot of facets to this process that perhaps the committee needs to be quite large because there need to be subcommittees.

226
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:50,531
And I think that's what we should be talking about today, not about whether or not we are gonna do X or Y or Z because none of us is qualified to make those decisions.

227
00:20:54,362 --> 00:20:55,042
Member McLaughlin.

228
00:20:57,803 --> 00:20:58,203
Thank you.

229
00:20:58,923 --> 00:21:08,025
Also, I just, you know, this was sort of a tricky thing in that it was a crossover between two administrations, right?

230
00:21:08,145 --> 00:21:15,747
And so, and also two new school committee members and new central administration and a whole bunch of things.

231
00:21:15,827 --> 00:21:20,868
And so I think really sort of getting an understanding again to Member Graham's point and also

232
00:21:21,368 --> 00:21:38,598
Member Kretsch's point, getting an understanding both of what the intention was under the former administration and the former school committee when this was established initially to, you know, again, what the intent is today, you know, what that looks like, what our policy

233
00:21:39,138 --> 00:22:07,967
suggest we do when we're making this sort of an ad hoc committee and again to member Graham's point what the you know what the individuals who should be what the selection process is and what we're looking for in terms of expertise because I also don't feel like necessarily a vision committee I certainly I think a vision committee will be able to do it sounds like what we're asking them to do is you know research walkthroughs you know cost analysis potentially I mean I don't really know because we haven't spelled that out

234
00:22:08,447 --> 00:22:27,632
But even among those people it doesn't necessarily mean that we're going to have experts per se, unless that's what we're saying is we're looking for community based experts and if that's what we're saying, as opposed to community members who are submitting applications then I think we need some clarification on that too but I just want to make sure that those who are watching or those who watch later.

235
00:22:28,401 --> 00:22:38,826
community members, what have you, understand that this is something that has crossed two administrations and several school committee members.

236
00:22:38,866 --> 00:22:41,127
So we're all playing a little bit of catch up here.

237
00:22:41,588 --> 00:22:41,948
Thank you.

238
00:22:44,709 --> 00:22:54,214
Member Rousseau, and then I know the admin did work on a slide deck that isn't fully ready, but maybe we can, I think that would go to intention and scope.

239
00:22:54,814 --> 00:22:55,414
Member Rousseau?

240
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:56,695
Thank you.

241
00:22:57,512 --> 00:23:01,953
I was there and my memory is that it was, let's do a vision committee.

242
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:04,833
And that was as far as we really got on what we meant.

243
00:23:05,754 --> 00:23:12,135
I think this committee can decide what we mean and what was bent then is sort of not relevant.

244
00:23:12,555 --> 00:23:17,276
It certainly would be good if it was, if there was a clear statement, I'd be all for like, let's dig it out.

245
00:23:18,156 --> 00:23:20,236
But my memory was there wasn't a clear statement.

246
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:22,937
And so now it's time for us to do it.

247
00:23:23,197 --> 00:23:24,557
And twice in the last,

248
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:41,667
Earlier today, as well as in February, I sent a clear statement of what I thought as a sort of a starting point for what that item B, which is the assignment the school committee wishes the committee to fulfill and the extent and limitations of its responsibilities, which is in our policy.

249
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:46,740
This is the essentially the scope and charter, what is it we want them to do.

250
00:23:47,481 --> 00:23:54,935
And, you know, I just drafted something since I felt it was important to that we could have something to respond to if you obviously if there are other

251
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:59,811
Other ideas, that's fine too, but mine is pretty short.

252
00:24:00,351 --> 00:24:12,073
It says that the Medford High School Vision Advisory Committee shall work to understand and state clearly the possible options for providing Medford with a high school that can suit our educational and other needs for the next 50 years.

253
00:24:12,613 --> 00:24:16,274
The options may only include those that will be carbon neutral or better.

254
00:24:17,074 --> 00:24:22,355
The advisory committee shall provide quarterly reports to the school committee with a presentation at the conclusion of service.

255
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:31,165
other than the part about carbon neutrality and the setting of a, you know, what's the window of time we're talking about here?

256
00:24:31,185 --> 00:24:43,572
50 years from now, I'm guessing building technology will be so remarkably different than today that it seemed like a good timeframe, 50 years, that we've gotten 50 years out of this high school.

257
00:24:44,713 --> 00:24:52,118
So, you know, that was just something that I put together and it was purposefully only really two points that are important to me

258
00:24:52,762 --> 00:24:55,703
is that we are not thinking in five and 10 year increments.

259
00:24:55,983 --> 00:25:04,586
We're thinking 50 years and that we're not building something that will continue to destroy the earth as we just built a police station way up on the air.

260
00:25:04,806 --> 00:25:05,086
Why?

261
00:25:05,326 --> 00:25:11,868
Because it's gonna be flooding by the time this high school, if it was for 50 years, by the time this high school finishes its service.

262
00:25:12,088 --> 00:25:20,071
So I get a little nervous about going any more specific because as member Graham said, I don't have

263
00:25:20,461 --> 00:25:27,263
any of the technical skills to know whether or not renovating and all that other stuff are necessary.

264
00:25:27,323 --> 00:25:42,289
But I also feel very strongly that we shouldn't be deciding ahead of time based on what we think the financial situation of the city will be in two, three, four, five, 10 years from now, when if there was a new high school, for instance, construction doesn't start a year from now.

265
00:25:42,389 --> 00:25:44,790
I mean, we could be the richest community in the state.

266
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:48,731
We couldn't begin from now and have a groundbreaking a year from now.

267
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:54,502
So I think the financial part should be, here's what it would look like cost-wise.

268
00:25:55,002 --> 00:26:04,364
And then we get those back and we in the community look at them and decide, okay, well, I mean, we can or can't afford this or what option do we want?

269
00:26:04,485 --> 00:26:06,565
But I don't know what those options would look like.

270
00:26:06,605 --> 00:26:09,286
So that's for me is where I feel like we need to start.

271
00:26:13,775 --> 00:26:16,016
I wanted to share, good evening committee members.

272
00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:23,218
I did want to share that I did have the opportunity to work with both Principal DeLaver and Principal Fallon.

273
00:26:23,978 --> 00:26:30,460
And as we were thinking and preparing for today's committee of the whole, we were kind of envisioning

274
00:26:32,688 --> 00:26:33,209
structure.

275
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:47,585
It's a separate slide deck, but I would love the opportunity to be able to just share some of the thinking based on what different members have said this evening about how we need to think more broadly.

276
00:26:48,386 --> 00:26:52,850
but also to say like these are some of the other possibilities that we've been thinking about.

277
00:26:53,871 --> 00:27:09,864
The first slide deck that was presented was kind of, you know, in the absence of us not being able to, you know, meet in large groups and go on tours, it would really be wonderful for everyone to see the work that's happening, especially in Cosmo where it's like

278
00:27:10,765 --> 00:27:21,068
happening right now and it's just exciting to see the floors and everything feels new and you feel like it's HDTV and they should be videotaping everything that's happening.

279
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:28,950
But I would love to be able to share this second deck with you which

280
00:27:31,736 --> 00:27:43,761
was our thinking about the vision, the vision planning, Dr. Cushing was involved as well, but this is more of a structured way.

281
00:27:43,841 --> 00:27:51,684
But for those of you who like to kind of see it as a structure, this is a little more formal, but this is just a proposal.

282
00:27:51,764 --> 00:27:58,547
So it's in draft form, but this was kind of our best thinking as a team.

283
00:27:59,668 --> 00:28:03,214
And thank you, Dr. Cushing, for starting the slide.

284
00:28:03,234 --> 00:28:11,027
And I know since we're in this format, similar to what was said,

285
00:28:13,315 --> 00:28:16,537
In October of 19, I was new, just coming on board.

286
00:28:16,557 --> 00:28:31,625
At that time, Mr. DeLava spoke to this, that we announced an official process for this master vision plan and how do we see Medford Public Schools evolving and changing.

287
00:28:32,566 --> 00:28:42,151
And at that point in time, we also looked at our vocational programming, which is definitely playing an integral role

288
00:28:42,811 --> 00:28:43,371
envisioning.

289
00:28:43,411 --> 00:29:00,582
And as you could see with all the programs that are being updated and enhanced and, you know, these are additional opportunities for our students, I truly, truly feel like there is such untapped potential on the vocational side of the house.

290
00:29:00,862 --> 00:29:05,164
And you can proceed to the next slide, Dr. Cushing.

291
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:20,496
There's such potential and we are talking about how can we maximize the potential of the vocational side of the house for the entire comprehensive school community.

292
00:29:21,337 --> 00:29:34,159
And start thinking outside of the box, start thinking innovatively and saying, how could Medford High School, our flagship building, re-envision itself?

293
00:29:35,255 --> 00:29:42,879
And so I'm going to let Mr. Fallon, I'm going to let you jump in on the mission statement because we're in this mode.

294
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:49,762
It's hard to see where people are at, but I'm going to, I'm going to let you guys start and then I will support you because we all worked on this together.

295
00:29:50,743 --> 00:29:52,684
Mr. Fallon, Mr. DeLava, either or.

296
00:29:53,384 --> 00:29:56,245
Well, so the mission statement, so I think,

297
00:29:57,777 --> 00:30:10,487
One thing that we should note is there's been work within the building regarding NEASC, regarding our own is when we, when I first became principal here at the high school, that was one of the functions that we were doing.

298
00:30:10,527 --> 00:30:13,269
And pre-COVID, we were sort of halfway there.

299
00:30:13,309 --> 00:30:22,676
We were trying to get a vision statement of what a student that comes into Medford High School in ninth grade and what they should end up with out in 12th grade.

300
00:30:22,716 --> 00:30:25,338
And that would have been our mantra, our whole,

301
00:30:27,093 --> 00:30:30,158
way of education through here at the high school.

302
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:34,283
And that also includes structural pieces within the building.

303
00:30:35,185 --> 00:30:37,468
You know, I taught here.

304
00:30:38,189 --> 00:30:39,490
Prior to the science labs.

305
00:30:41,513 --> 00:30:44,655
find it very intriguing how they have turned out.

306
00:30:44,695 --> 00:30:55,743
I think maybe I might have stayed in teaching more instead of going to administration knowing that those resources were going to be part of the learning process.

307
00:30:56,003 --> 00:30:57,364
I mean that's a little bit of a joke but

308
00:30:58,411 --> 00:30:59,471
I'm happy where I am.

309
00:30:59,531 --> 00:31:07,534
I just wanted to say that it is a good thing that when structure reflects the educational value, it's very important.

310
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:15,197
So this mission statement has been changed through NEASC from the prior administration being here at the high school.

311
00:31:15,997 --> 00:31:19,378
When NEASC comes around again, we'll be looking to rework it as well.

312
00:31:19,998 --> 00:31:31,624
But I think, you know, through the years, it's important that a mission statement basically is at the top of your head so I always still go back to the Andrews one, because I remember it excellence through responsibility and respect.

313
00:31:32,305 --> 00:31:33,926
I think everybody knew that mantra.

314
00:31:34,947 --> 00:31:35,408
going through.

315
00:31:35,468 --> 00:31:40,771
And then again, new administration comes in and if they feel there's a different avenue for that, that happens.

316
00:31:40,831 --> 00:31:41,031
So.

317
00:31:41,952 --> 00:31:42,732
Well, can I jump in?

318
00:31:43,133 --> 00:31:43,333
Yep.

319
00:31:43,373 --> 00:31:43,853
Go right ahead.

320
00:31:44,113 --> 00:31:44,454
Thank you.

321
00:31:44,494 --> 00:31:57,943
So member Russo, thank you for also kind of framing the, the idea of what the vision committee is, because I think when, when we, when we, when we've been talking about this for a while but as, as kind of the team was discussing what this meant,

322
00:31:58,897 --> 00:32:05,304
We were trying to decide, so as an educator, when you hear vision, you think one thing, and that's usually how are teachers engaging with each other?

323
00:32:05,324 --> 00:32:06,866
How are students responding to each other?

324
00:32:06,906 --> 00:32:10,209
What's the conversation you hear in the hallways when you walk through between classes?

325
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:15,455
And Paul and I were able to think about what does our high school look like five years from now?

326
00:32:15,595 --> 00:32:17,076
What did it look like 10 years ago?

327
00:32:17,116 --> 00:32:17,897
What does it look like now?

328
00:32:17,917 --> 00:32:19,099
And what are the things we want to change?

329
00:32:19,739 --> 00:32:20,860
And so we were trying to distinguish.

330
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:27,845
So that's why it was helpful member or so when you kind of spoke to the fact that this vision committee was really formed for more than physical structure, perhaps.

331
00:32:27,905 --> 00:32:32,248
Am I am I right to assume that that the vision committee was really tasked with the building itself?

332
00:32:33,549 --> 00:32:40,854
It was a direct response to countless complaints about bathrooms that don't function.

333
00:32:40,874 --> 00:32:45,917
I mean, we didn't even get into the fact that barely anything of that building is ADA compliant.

334
00:32:47,018 --> 00:32:47,218
I mean,

335
00:32:48,779 --> 00:33:02,371
You know, my son is just there this year, so obviously he isn't really there, but there's not many people in the community that don't think that the physical structure is in need of a lot.

336
00:33:03,252 --> 00:33:07,496
It was not in response to the education that's provided in any way, shape or form is my memory.

337
00:33:08,489 --> 00:33:25,143
So when Paul and I were thinking about what what a high school of the future looks like, you know we started at the very bottom which was mission and vision, and you know a lot of the exercises last year that we had teachers being part of was really creating a shared vision, and that takes time, unfortunately it really does, but we're at the, we're at the point now where we felt like.

338
00:33:26,467 --> 00:33:37,054
However, this team is made up whoever the stakeholders end up being Paul and I would be, you know, have active roles because this is the school that we're going to be at this is the school that we want to see bring into the, you know, bring into the future.

339
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:40,456
So starting at this we thought as a team with Maurice and Peter.

340
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:53,683
what is it that we can provide the committee so that they know here are the things that have already been done over the last 10 years in the physical building so that we can at least prioritize what needs to be done either if we renovate or if we come in with a wrecking ball.

341
00:33:54,303 --> 00:34:05,549
If you go to the next slide, what we did was we tried to put things into kind of seven categories that if we are able to sit at the table with the stakeholders, we can say, we're gonna first of all, provide you information.

342
00:34:05,649 --> 00:34:09,571
So committee members on this committee will see what are the things that have been done?

343
00:34:10,091 --> 00:34:11,472
Where do we really need to put our work?

344
00:34:11,572 --> 00:34:12,393
Where do we need to start?

345
00:34:12,513 --> 00:34:13,254
Is it bathrooms?

346
00:34:13,354 --> 00:34:13,874
Is it roof?

347
00:34:14,095 --> 00:34:15,676
Is it plumbing?

348
00:34:16,777 --> 00:34:25,024
If we provide the committee with all the information, which would include the enrollment of our school, you know, Medford High had 4,000 students years ago, and now there's 1,300.

349
00:34:26,044 --> 00:34:26,765
So it's a lot different.

350
00:34:26,785 --> 00:34:29,347
So when we think of a new building, we're not designing a school for 4,000 students anymore.

351
00:34:32,182 --> 00:34:42,251
So what we did was we hoped that providing some process for this would help people on the committee really understand and really do the difficult work of deciding what a school might look like.

352
00:34:43,753 --> 00:34:45,454
I don't know if Maurice, if you wanna jump in or.

353
00:34:45,474 --> 00:34:49,138
May I have a point of privilege?

354
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:51,280
Member McLaughlin.

355
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:52,508
Thank you.

356
00:34:52,588 --> 00:34:53,349
Thank you, Mr. Collin.

357
00:34:53,709 --> 00:35:05,355
I guess I want to say from, you know, as a community member and people that I've been talking with in the community regarding the vision committee, I think, you know, the physical structure is one aspect of the vision committee.

358
00:35:05,435 --> 00:35:15,040
I don't think it's the sole aspect from my perspective, which is a large reason why we were talking about making sure also that the vision committee was a diverse representation.

359
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:18,482
I think we need to hear from the vision committee about what

360
00:35:18,982 --> 00:35:33,600
It is they see from all aspects of the vision of the high school, and what needs to happen for the future of the high school, not just the physical structure, frankly, I think it is a combination of, you know, a variety of things.

361
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,784
For example, the, you know, I think the

362
00:35:38,873 --> 00:35:42,158
the anti-racism task force, some of the curriculum things that we've been talking about.

363
00:35:42,178 --> 00:35:50,108
I mean, I think that there's a whole ball of wax that we're talking, the social, emotional, and the physical, and potentially the academic.

364
00:35:50,168 --> 00:35:55,976
And I think that this, you know, breaking down of it is great, but I wouldn't limit it to just the physical structure.

365
00:35:56,682 --> 00:35:58,504
So luckily we didn't then.

366
00:35:58,544 --> 00:36:05,129
So I'm glad you said that Melanie, because that's why I was thanking member Russo for kind of clarifying it to me and maybe to other members.

367
00:36:05,189 --> 00:36:19,981
But what we did is we were thinking more in general that yes, this would be, we know that the intent was heavy on building the plant itself, but there's other things that go into that, that when we think about what a building would look like in five years, there's a lot of layers.

368
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:21,743
So we actually did that.

369
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:31,796
And also just to piggyback, there's so many stakeholders that are involved in regarding this, not just the vision committee.

370
00:36:32,656 --> 00:36:33,937
It's you as a school committee.

371
00:36:34,177 --> 00:36:36,337
It's our site council here at the high school.

372
00:36:36,878 --> 00:36:39,158
There's a lot of pieces that are involved here.

373
00:36:39,258 --> 00:36:46,621
So what I'm trying to hope to get out of this committee of the whole two is a structured plan or a structured function

374
00:36:47,361 --> 00:36:52,985
for that vision committee are as more of an advisory piece.

375
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,886
Are they doing fact finding for us?

376
00:36:55,607 --> 00:36:59,409
And then we're taking it back to our site council and then we're reviewing it.

377
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:03,052
I mean, like I said, there's so many different groups and stakeholders.

378
00:37:03,092 --> 00:37:10,617
I just wanna make sure that it's clear of what the challenges or what the outcomes will be regarding this committee.

379
00:37:23,265 --> 00:37:23,525
Mayor.

380
00:37:24,085 --> 00:37:26,286
Madam Mayor, Mr Rousseau has a question.

381
00:37:26,666 --> 00:37:26,806
Yep.

382
00:37:26,906 --> 00:37:27,427
I didn't see him.

383
00:37:28,007 --> 00:37:28,607
Member Rousseau.

384
00:37:29,507 --> 00:37:29,887
Thank you.

385
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:36,490
Um, yeah, I'm just going through the approved policy on this advisory committees to the school committee.

386
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,891
So I mean, I just want to be clear.

387
00:37:39,031 --> 00:37:43,072
I have no intention or interest in providing what the vision is.

388
00:37:43,272 --> 00:37:47,654
That was sort of the point is the community will decide what the vision is.

389
00:37:48,274 --> 00:37:50,115
The community comes together and says,

390
00:37:50,645 --> 00:37:52,646
knock it all down and put a bunch of trailers in.

391
00:37:52,686 --> 00:37:57,388
That's what Medford really wants, which I can't imagine, but let's pretend.

392
00:37:57,868 --> 00:38:00,229
Then that's what the community wants.

393
00:38:00,289 --> 00:38:03,110
I'm on for two year terms, just like everybody else here.

394
00:38:03,871 --> 00:38:07,372
This vision needs to be something that the community has agreed to.

395
00:38:07,392 --> 00:38:14,235
I mean, certainly the spark was about physical plants.

396
00:38:14,789 --> 00:38:31,624
I completely agree with Member McLaughlin and Paul and Chad and everybody else who's spoken that that's, you know, the physical plant is, you know, a building is a lot more than the physical structure and how it integrates into the community and what do we include and what do we not include.

397
00:38:31,664 --> 00:38:34,507
You know, MSBA, you can't build a pool with MSBA.

398
00:38:34,967 --> 00:38:37,430
So, you know, those are really hard questions that we have to answer.

399
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:37,850
We can't

400
00:38:38,355 --> 00:38:41,677
build a building that is bigger than MSBA will allow us.

401
00:38:42,017 --> 00:38:44,398
MSBA is the Massachusetts School Building Authority.

402
00:38:44,438 --> 00:38:46,299
They fund school buildings.

403
00:38:47,379 --> 00:38:50,561
We can't actually build a building as big as that one that we have now.

404
00:38:50,681 --> 00:39:02,566
So we would have really important and hard conversations around the Medford Family Network and preschool and all these other things that are in our physical plant now that absolutely there's no way that the new building

405
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:06,875
could be funded through the normal structures and include those.

406
00:39:06,935 --> 00:39:10,677
So those are really important things, but I think the community should decide that.

407
00:39:10,737 --> 00:39:28,005
I mean, the school committee, obviously we have a role here, but I don't have any interest in providing my vision because my vision is pretty much straightforward and simple, knock the whole thing down, pretend there's a limitless amount of money, call Mr. Bloomberg and he'll just write us a couple billion dollar check and we'll be all happy.

408
00:39:28,025 --> 00:39:30,447
Unfortunately, that's not reality, but,

409
00:39:32,251 --> 00:39:38,273
But that's why I think that, first of all, it does need to have a lot of people on it, and I don't know how many.

410
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:46,395
I want to also be clear that I firmly and very strongly believe it cannot be majority employees of the city or of the school system.

411
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:51,916
It must be majority, not us, because this is not

412
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:55,942
the principal's vision.

413
00:39:56,042 --> 00:39:57,664
This is not the school committee's vision.

414
00:39:57,704 --> 00:40:00,105
This needs to be the city of Medford's vision.

415
00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:06,650
Because if we end up with a vision where the only thing they come back and say is, we've got three options.

416
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:13,175
They all involve knocking the building down and doing an override or whatever that thing is called when you get a loan like that.

417
00:40:14,536 --> 00:40:16,697
They're the ones who are gonna have to sell it to the community.

418
00:40:16,717 --> 00:40:19,019
I mean, they have to vote for it.

419
00:40:19,755 --> 00:40:25,739
You know, we're seven votes or however many of us live in Medford, we can't accomplish that.

420
00:40:25,899 --> 00:40:33,144
So the community needs to be 100% behind whatever the heck that vision is, because they're going to have to pay for it.

421
00:40:33,284 --> 00:40:35,646
Actually, no matter what the options are, they're going to have to pay for it.

422
00:40:35,846 --> 00:40:36,046
So.

423
00:40:36,926 --> 00:40:45,132
So I was wondering if we'd be able to continue with the slide deck, just so that we can really show those pieces that we're talking about that I think would help frame the work.

424
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:48,872
And I just want to say, I agree that it has to be a shared vision.

425
00:40:49,132 --> 00:41:04,480
We were just thinking, we're going to have to do a lot of the, we want to provide this committee with all the information they need so that they can make these decisions, so that they can begin to have these conversations, because a lot of people don't know about the things that we've been doing within the building, because as far as we know, we're stuck with this building.

426
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:05,761
Point of information.

427
00:41:05,781 --> 00:41:07,282
Point of information.

428
00:41:07,342 --> 00:41:09,583
Point of information, member Rousseau, then Mr. DeLeva.

429
00:41:10,243 --> 00:41:11,004
Thank you.

430
00:41:11,044 --> 00:41:15,446
Part of the policy, I just wanted to provide this, I realize not everybody's necessarily read the policy, but

431
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:32,963
Part of this is that the, when you say the committee, Mr. Fallon, I just wanna be clear, the committee being the advisory committee, we have to give the advisory committee a certain set of authority to request reports from you and whomever else, buildings and grounds, and not have us be in the middle.

432
00:41:33,604 --> 00:41:37,847
We can't be in the middle of every time the advisory committee says,

433
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:39,553
well, what's our heating bill?

434
00:41:39,733 --> 00:41:43,397
It can't come to school committee and get on the agenda, because this will be a 10 year project.

435
00:41:43,437 --> 00:41:45,259
So I agree with you completely.

436
00:41:45,299 --> 00:41:49,102
I just, when you said the committee, it's the advisory committee, not us.

437
00:41:49,122 --> 00:41:52,986
I mean, that should be making these requests and getting what they need.

438
00:41:53,006 --> 00:41:54,948
Sorry, thank you.

439
00:41:55,508 --> 00:41:55,849
Thank you.

440
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:59,772
I actually had a question for a member of Vanderkloot.

441
00:42:00,572 --> 00:42:05,234
Yes, she has extensive knowledge when new schools came into play.

442
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:07,816
I happen to be teaching at the old Hobbes.

443
00:42:09,356 --> 00:42:11,778
At the time, and the transition happened.

444
00:42:12,298 --> 00:42:22,023
So she actually has some knowledge based off when we transferred into our new schools newer schools at the time so.

445
00:42:22,943 --> 00:42:23,103
Ms.

446
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:31,409
Vanderkloof, what I was wondering is, while I was a new teacher at that time, the process, though, had committees, if I'm correct on that?

447
00:42:31,429 --> 00:42:31,949
Absolutely.

448
00:42:33,225 --> 00:42:35,286
So we had the building the future committee.

449
00:42:35,526 --> 00:42:46,553
And I would say that it came somewhat similar in that there was a great deal of discussion amongst in the community about the shape.

450
00:42:47,894 --> 00:42:56,380
And then several school committee members, including myself spearheaded, bringing it to the floor for discussion and, you know,

451
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,781
moving it forward.

452
00:42:59,361 --> 00:43:03,543
One of the things which helped us was we had dynamic leadership of the committee.

453
00:43:04,223 --> 00:43:11,906
Rick Orlando and Tricia McDonough really did such an incredibly fabulous job outlining the path.

454
00:43:12,867 --> 00:43:22,270
The first discussions were, there was a series of events around the community, listening events, getting people's input.

455
00:43:22,791 --> 00:43:23,611
What were they thinking?

456
00:43:23,651 --> 00:43:24,491
What were they seeing?

457
00:43:24,551 --> 00:43:26,212
What were their reactions?

458
00:43:27,012 --> 00:43:29,274
and their concerns as we move forward.

459
00:43:30,055 --> 00:43:39,182
And remember, at that point, there was no, you know, in a similar way, we had not preconceived that we were going to build four new schools.

460
00:43:39,262 --> 00:43:39,863
We didn't know.

461
00:43:40,503 --> 00:43:45,688
All of that came into being over the course of the process.

462
00:43:46,387 --> 00:44:01,299
of the committee looking at the various different resources, concerns, land parcels availability, but even would they be K to H, would they be, none of that was preconceived.

463
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:03,661
That was all part of the work of the committee.

464
00:44:05,122 --> 00:44:07,604
And that was then defined.

465
00:44:08,064 --> 00:44:12,968
One of the things that was extremely important was there were different phases of the committee.

466
00:44:13,008 --> 00:44:15,310
So the first was kind of the outreach

467
00:44:16,271 --> 00:44:20,975
Then the second was taking the information and coming up with some decisions.

468
00:44:21,215 --> 00:44:32,927
And those ones then were brought to the school committee for our input, because if we weren't buying it, there was no way we were going to be able to sell it to the community.

469
00:44:33,908 --> 00:44:38,132
And then a variety of different meetings happened around

470
00:44:38,812 --> 00:44:45,923
uh Medford uh you know outreaching to different groups and whatnot explaining what was um uh

471
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:51,563
what project proposals there were, what ideas there were, and narrowing it down.

472
00:44:51,683 --> 00:44:56,347
So it's really quite a process in the same way that I think that we're thinking here.

473
00:44:57,568 --> 00:45:00,350
Were there discussions about educational?

474
00:45:01,511 --> 00:45:04,834
Yes, absolutely, and they need to be included as well.

475
00:45:05,435 --> 00:45:15,303
One of the things though that is very interesting sort of looking back is that there will be people who say, I just don't understand why.

476
00:45:16,493 --> 00:45:31,943
And they really have no understanding today why certain decisions were made back then about either the placement of the schools or why there's a K to eight and a middle school on one piece of property.

477
00:45:32,383 --> 00:45:37,267
So that's one of the interesting things as time goes on, those pieces are lost to the community.

478
00:45:37,787 --> 00:45:40,909
And then we have people saying, I don't understand this.

479
00:45:41,069 --> 00:45:45,532
And I can tell you that all of those decisions were thoroughly vetted

480
00:45:46,605 --> 00:45:49,866
and that there was a basis for each one of those decisions.

481
00:45:50,566 --> 00:45:52,506
But over time, it does get lost.

482
00:45:52,806 --> 00:45:57,207
And that's a valuable thing for me to realize as we go forward with this.

483
00:45:58,567 --> 00:46:10,309
I do wanna mention, by the way, that there was at the time, the third stage of building the future committee, which is what we called it.

484
00:46:10,369 --> 00:46:13,130
The third stage was the high school.

485
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:14,950
And there was some work

486
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:17,411
you know, things done over time.

487
00:46:17,571 --> 00:46:38,757
And then at some point, Dr. Perrella, you may recall, the former headmaster of the high school, he put together a, he wanted to put together a grant and he looked very much at the library area and discussed a lot about what should be happening educationally in that area.

488
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:41,857
And I thought it was a very thorough vetting.

489
00:46:41,897 --> 00:46:43,618
There was a, at the time,

490
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:47,148
There was a, they put together a presentation.

491
00:46:47,969 --> 00:47:02,383
And that's something that you know as we're talking about the things we're talking about not just the physical structure but how is the building going to be used educationally, we should, even though of course I'm sure it needs to be updated but we should look back to that, what happened at that point to.

492
00:47:04,638 --> 00:47:09,782
The, it was a very dedicated group of people.

493
00:47:11,043 --> 00:47:13,605
They had to be able to meet.

494
00:47:13,806 --> 00:47:16,668
I think at first we were meeting weekly.

495
00:47:17,869 --> 00:47:24,294
We could check with Rick Orlando and Tricia about exactly that, but it was a long process.

496
00:47:24,454 --> 00:47:27,837
I would say that it was probably about a year before we came

497
00:47:29,338 --> 00:47:38,165
was the first presentation and the first narrowing down steps was, you know, it was a significant process of time.

498
00:47:40,487 --> 00:47:41,848
I don't know if that answers the question.

499
00:47:42,749 --> 00:47:43,910
No, thank you.

500
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:53,397
I think you hold a valuable experience regarding this based off of the newer schools that were built at the time.

501
00:47:54,137 --> 00:47:58,841
And like you said, you have an idea of the process and who was involved.

502
00:47:58,901 --> 00:48:03,364
And it was mostly community members, as member Russo was saying.

503
00:48:04,846 --> 00:48:14,389
If I remember correctly, there were a couple of administrators, but they were just overseeing because they had knowledge base that community members probably couldn't grab right at the time.

504
00:48:14,889 --> 00:48:15,169
Right.

505
00:48:15,369 --> 00:48:19,611
We certainly had a few staff, but there were also people who acted.

506
00:48:19,891 --> 00:48:22,952
They might have attended the meetings because they were giving information.

507
00:48:23,432 --> 00:48:23,992
Right.

508
00:48:25,312 --> 00:48:33,495
You know, so it depended, but I think we were we really started at ground zero without great

509
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:38,552
you know, with no preconceptions about what was going to happen.

510
00:48:40,652 --> 00:48:41,533
There's a blank slate.

511
00:48:42,573 --> 00:48:43,594
Thank you.

512
00:48:43,614 --> 00:48:45,774
The six o'clock subcommittee meeting was canceled.

513
00:48:45,795 --> 00:48:47,575
Is that correct?

514
00:48:47,595 --> 00:48:51,097
Or are we on a hard hour tonight?

515
00:48:51,117 --> 00:48:54,078
I didn't know that.

516
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:55,939
Which was the six o'clock subcommittee meeting.

517
00:48:56,619 --> 00:48:57,099
Oh, I'm not sure.

518
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:59,240
I just know this said five to six, so I just want to

519
00:49:01,378 --> 00:49:03,420
I don't think there was a six o'clock subcommittee meeting.

520
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,701
I think we're not on a higher.

521
00:49:04,721 --> 00:49:05,521
I think six was tomorrow.

522
00:49:06,122 --> 00:49:07,002
Six is tomorrow, okay.

523
00:49:07,282 --> 00:49:08,083
Which is canceled.

524
00:49:08,103 --> 00:49:10,665
The subcommittee meeting for tomorrow has been canceled.

525
00:49:10,685 --> 00:49:11,485
It was five to 6.30.

526
00:49:11,946 --> 00:49:12,306
Thank you.

527
00:49:13,047 --> 00:49:16,389
Okay.

528
00:49:16,649 --> 00:49:30,279
I think we need to probably create a plan for how we're gonna get, when and how we're gonna advertise and make sure we have a way to get it out to the entire community

529
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:34,204
to make sure that we're getting applications and new applications.

530
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:46,146
And so I think sometime after the new year is probably best to do that and maybe use most of what the last application said and maybe add a few questions to it.

531
00:49:46,226 --> 00:49:56,407
I think maybe we start there and then I think we're on the right track after we get that out and spend plenty of time advertising that, then we come up with a charge.

532
00:50:00,028 --> 00:50:00,248
Sorry.

533
00:50:01,003 --> 00:50:13,286
Member Russo did start that, but I think that's something we need to have a whole nother meeting on to create a formal charge that we will give the vision committee once it is fully established.

534
00:50:14,967 --> 00:50:26,730
And then I think at that point, I think the vision committee is gonna probably need subcommittees and one of those will be outreach and strategy communication to be able to grab, whether that's a survey or

535
00:50:28,208 --> 00:50:32,571
or what we need to make sure we're reaching out to the whole community to give ideas and suggestions.

536
00:50:32,652 --> 00:50:38,036
So that's just what, just wanted to figure out a way how to stop the process.

537
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:44,741
And I think probably by the end of January, we should maybe have this application out and come up with a plan on how to get it out.

538
00:50:46,022 --> 00:50:49,325
And member Russo, then member Graham, then member McLaughlin.

539
00:50:50,065 --> 00:50:50,405
Thank you.

540
00:50:50,646 --> 00:50:51,186
I just wanna be quick.

541
00:50:53,067 --> 00:50:53,688
That is, I don't,

542
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:55,171
That is certainly a way to do it.

543
00:50:55,291 --> 00:51:06,119
And I don't think it's a terrible way, but I would say that by providing what that statement is first, I know if I was looking to volunteer, I'd wanna know what am I volunteering for?

544
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:14,145
And I think if I was being told I was volunteering to participate in a vision, figuring out what our high school would look like.

545
00:51:14,365 --> 00:51:20,109
And all I cared about as a community member was how to make sure we actually even have a planet a century from now.

546
00:51:20,892 --> 00:51:36,665
And if you told me that the vision included that we will only consider options, and again, I put that on there, that we only are considering carbon neutral or better options, that would excite me as somebody who was like, all right, I can participate in this because I know that's what I'm going to be doing.

547
00:51:36,725 --> 00:51:46,372
If you ask me to be involved and you don't tell me what it is exactly, well, I mean, there's just a lot of other things, especially for volunteers to participate in.

548
00:51:47,791 --> 00:52:02,558
And I think that if we, for instance, ended up with a statement that says it needs to be carbon neutral and we don't end up with anybody who has, you know, has a education in that background or does that for a living, then it's going to be just endless, like finding consultants.

549
00:52:02,658 --> 00:52:11,903
And my opinion is this and Google searches when we could really make that much quicker if there's an environmental engineer, whatever the proper titles are.

550
00:52:12,303 --> 00:52:16,845
So, I mean, my preference is definitely to put that forward first so that those people who are volunteering

551
00:52:17,262 --> 00:52:19,804
can say, oh, I do care about that.

552
00:52:22,225 --> 00:52:23,306
That's just my preference.

553
00:52:23,386 --> 00:52:23,667
Thank you.

554
00:52:23,687 --> 00:52:24,047
Thank you.

555
00:52:24,367 --> 00:52:25,888
Member Graham, then Member McLaughlin.

556
00:52:32,973 --> 00:52:34,574
Sorry about that.

557
00:52:35,555 --> 00:52:36,756
It's been a long day of Zooming.

558
00:52:36,836 --> 00:52:46,823
So I was also thinking about some of the things that I heard in the original, in the last process, where I heard people say things like,

559
00:52:47,612 --> 00:52:50,815
I wasn't sure what the time commitment was.

560
00:52:50,915 --> 00:52:53,317
So I didn't sign up.

561
00:52:53,697 --> 00:52:58,501
And then I also heard people who were selected who were like, I still don't know what I signed up for.

562
00:52:58,521 --> 00:53:00,763
And like, I may or may not be able to do this.

563
00:53:00,863 --> 00:53:13,713
So I think it is important for us to like come up with that, that sort of charge, as well as some, some sort of rough sketch of how

564
00:53:14,393 --> 00:53:19,830
we think the committee needs to be comprised and where is the balance of like,

565
00:53:20,752 --> 00:53:33,239
the person who really wants to be involved but cannot come to a meeting every single week, maybe there's a role for them versus the person who has a background in environmental science building schools and like what we would want from them.

566
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:47,368
So I do think even if it means our application doesn't go out until the end of February, honestly, I think it's worth our investment to like take the time to sort of spec that out, this group and really

567
00:53:48,073 --> 00:54:04,182
be on the same page about what we're asking the group to do, how we envision that the group will operate, because I think it needs to be bigger than it was, but as soon as you get bigger than it was, you have to have some substructures in place.

568
00:54:04,222 --> 00:54:15,187
And maybe we can have some of that discussion to sort of provide that guidance and then send out the application so that there really is like a place for everybody to

569
00:54:17,151 --> 00:54:32,203
feel like there's a home for them to participate without having to blindly say, yes, I have an unlimited number of hours to give to Medford public schools so I think I'd rather us take the time in January and even if it goes into February to get that part.

570
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:54,623
right and like sort of like staked out in some fashion so that when we send the application out we can both be clear about what what we're asking the larger committee to do and also maybe there are sub jobs that we're trying to find people to fill but also that we can have a clear message at that time about

571
00:54:56,115 --> 00:55:11,861
that we are committed to having more voices than just the people on the committee and this is how we will do it and there, you know, I think we found in the reopening task force there were a good number of people uniquely interested in the communications piece of what needed to happen and they were, it was a great group so

572
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:34,955
um you know maybe there's a way for us to make sure that we are being clear about all the like various things that we think we need before that application goes out the door and I think honestly like we're probably not going to be in a position to be like lots of on-site activity in large groups between now and then anyway so I think we just maybe use the time to to do that right up front.

573
00:55:36,496 --> 00:55:36,797
Thank you.

574
00:55:36,897 --> 00:55:38,518
Member McLaughlin then Member Van de Kloet.

575
00:55:40,808 --> 00:55:41,248
Thank you.

576
00:55:41,428 --> 00:55:54,576
I would agree that we need to be very specific in the charge around what it is we're asking the community to be part of and to be, you know, really take the time to spell that out, which, you know, I don't think anyone's proposing that that happened tonight.

577
00:55:54,616 --> 00:56:04,121
But I do think that, again, that's something we should do with what the hourly requirement is, and maybe some of the specific roles that we're hoping to fill.

578
00:56:04,221 --> 00:56:07,603
And, you know, some of these those other things that we can work around.

579
00:56:07,623 --> 00:56:08,684
I also think that

580
00:56:09,182 --> 00:56:18,286
we really need to be thinking, obviously, I'm sure you are thinking of this, Mayor, is translation for all of this material, applications, and anything else.

581
00:56:18,306 --> 00:56:38,536
But I also think that we need to, as we consider the BIPOC community, I really think that as we're even structuring what we want the MHS, technical high school vision committee to look like, that we need to be able to engage some stakeholders in our community

582
00:56:38,983 --> 00:57:03,045
that represent the BIPOC community to say, are we really thinking about everybody even in this statement and even in how we're rolling this out so that perhaps as we're structuring this statement, we could be thinking about who are some leaders in a variety of different constituencies so that, again, much like what's been happening in subcommittee meetings, we are going to some

583
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:06,047
you know, experts in those areas to ask.

584
00:57:06,547 --> 00:57:26,562
So I would also just suggest that as we're even creating the mission for the vision committee and the structure for the statements before the applications go out, that we have some identified community stakeholders that really can help fulfill the role of the BIPOC community that we're not representing here, please.

585
00:57:29,244 --> 00:57:29,624
Thank you.

586
00:57:30,045 --> 00:57:30,585
Member Wierdekloot?

587
00:57:36,258 --> 00:57:42,691
One of the things I just wanted to mention was the importance of also having

588
00:57:44,440 --> 00:58:10,993
members go out and even if just in the initial process we did visitations to other school districts and that was so important and that's really harder to do right now because of COVID but you know most of us are framed you know we know our high school maybe we've been in another one but we certainly you know haven't been in a lot and we we went to quite a few other districts and that was

589
00:58:11,793 --> 00:58:20,142
very instrumental and that required that people were also available to take some time during the day.

590
00:58:21,704 --> 00:58:32,415
And that was important because it excited us incredibly to see, to come out of our world and also to see what was being offered

591
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:33,945
in other districts.

592
00:58:34,025 --> 00:58:42,568
And so I just want to mention that, that maybe it can be conveyed somewhat by people visiting and then doing presentations.

593
00:58:43,009 --> 00:58:50,951
They can be, you know, that might be a job, if you would, that some people go, a smaller amount go and then make a presentation.

594
00:58:51,271 --> 00:58:55,173
But that's just another aspect we want to make sure we're doing is visitations.

595
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:57,273
Thank you.

596
00:58:57,334 --> 00:58:57,614
Divya?

597
00:58:57,634 --> 00:59:01,495
Let me just try to unmute you.

598
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:04,830
work.

599
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:06,492
Yeah, thank you.

600
00:59:06,512 --> 00:59:20,063
Um, I just wanted to add one more thing that I think was mentioned by a few folks here, which is, you know, who is, who are the people who are most impacted by the social and physical spaces in the high school.

601
00:59:21,144 --> 00:59:22,826
and most impacted negatively.

602
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:32,736
And to my mind, it would be students who have disabilities, students who identify as transgender in terms of their access to bathrooms, for example.

603
00:59:33,357 --> 00:59:38,122
So factoring in their input would need to be intentional.

604
00:59:39,123 --> 00:59:42,387
And also volunteering to these places is also a privilege.

605
00:59:45,797 --> 00:59:52,379
and recognizing that and doing targeted and intentional outreach because equity is not giving equal opportunity.

606
00:59:53,180 --> 01:00:01,303
It's not about doing lotteries or else we will end up with another committee, which is all white, like what happened the last time.

607
01:00:01,423 --> 01:00:10,726
So I just want to front and center that, that the people who are most impacted and that would include students as well, I would hope to be part of the vision committee.

608
01:00:11,306 --> 01:00:11,646
Thank you.

609
01:00:12,386 --> 01:00:12,747
Thank you.

610
01:00:13,447 --> 01:00:14,067
Member McLaughlin.

611
01:00:15,267 --> 01:00:16,887
Thank you, Divya, for that.

612
01:00:16,948 --> 01:00:17,288
Yeah.

613
01:00:17,688 --> 01:00:40,514
And so I just want to clarify around, you know, for folks that are watching as well, when Dr. Anand, when you're saying that it's a privilege, I'm hearing that you're saying that it's a privilege that people who maybe aren't working or have more flexible work hours or time, you know, or someone to take care of their children, that they're able to participate.

614
01:00:40,554 --> 01:00:42,235
Is that what you're saying when you say a privilege?

615
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:48,136
Oh, you're still muted, Dr. Anand, sorry.

616
01:00:51,699 --> 01:01:11,715
Yes, and if I'm, that too, and if I'm a parent who is, you know, of a child with a disability living in Medford housing, for example, and I'm working three jobs, my voice is very important to have, but at the same time, I do not have the time to devote and sit into a vision committee where, you know, on the one hand I might be a minority,

617
01:01:13,242 --> 01:01:22,366
And so I have the labor of educating everyone else in the room, plus, you know, have the luxury of time to devote to that space.

618
01:01:22,866 --> 01:01:30,269
So being mindful of these, you know, would be really helpful if we actually want to, you know, move into action in terms of equity.

619
01:01:31,630 --> 01:01:32,090
Thank you.

620
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:36,532
So I think we really have some work to do as a school committee around what that would look like.

621
01:01:36,592 --> 01:01:39,153
And I'd love to talk with you more about that if we could at some point.

622
01:01:39,693 --> 01:01:40,874
Yeah, sure, Melanie.

623
01:01:41,354 --> 01:01:41,614
Thank you.

624
01:01:44,718 --> 01:01:47,639
So it sounds like we wanna do the charge first.

625
01:01:47,699 --> 01:01:53,180
I think that's the majority of this school committee.

626
01:01:53,900 --> 01:02:03,642
I don't know if we wanna see more of that slideshow, if we want that email to us and we set up a meeting for early January to try to come up with a charge together.

627
01:02:06,042 --> 01:02:06,322
Thoughts?

628
01:02:09,323 --> 01:02:10,923
Member Rousseau, then member Graham.

629
01:02:12,004 --> 01:02:12,384
Thank you.

630
01:02:13,124 --> 01:02:13,304
Yes.

631
01:02:14,245 --> 01:02:20,886
You know, unfortunately, open meeting law is, this is an example of where open meeting law is truly a bit of a pain.

632
01:02:21,586 --> 01:02:31,828
You know, ideally we'd all have a Google doc open and we'd do a bunch of editing and we'd all come up with something we liked as a first draft and we'd come to the meeting and we could talk about it.

633
01:02:32,348 --> 01:02:34,869
And that would be against the law, so we can't do that.

634
01:02:36,109 --> 01:02:41,410
So, you know, how to accomplish drafting language as a committee,

635
01:02:43,482 --> 01:02:44,423
It's, it's awful.

636
01:02:44,843 --> 01:02:57,413
I mean, so, you know, I think that you know that that is part of why I had drafted something because I couldn't envision how to do this.

637
01:02:58,454 --> 01:02:59,495
But I think that if

638
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:15,575
know, if the superintendent reaches out to individual members, the sort of the weird exception here is the superintendent's not an elected official, she can reach out to all of us and try to understand what each of us wants and in a vision, in a

639
01:03:16,378 --> 01:03:25,560
in a charge statement and try to come up with something she thinks will work for all of us, as long as she's not like, well, Paul said this and Nia said that, you know, that wouldn't work.

640
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:33,301
And I personally feel like she could definitely do this work if she's okay with it or wants to assign it to someone.

641
01:03:33,321 --> 01:03:42,322
And that would be my preference, because honestly, if we just try to do it in a meeting like this on Zoom, I just feel like we're gonna have seven more meetings.

642
01:03:43,703 --> 01:03:45,963
Yeah, I think that sounds like a great idea.

643
01:03:46,447 --> 01:03:51,290
I know myself and my staff worked on a charge for the fire station task force.

644
01:03:51,350 --> 01:03:52,291
So that's an example.

645
01:03:52,431 --> 01:03:56,633
And plus Paul, you did start something that we can go off of.

646
01:03:56,713 --> 01:04:04,958
And if we just all send our ideas to Dr. Edward Vincent and the team, maybe we can try to draft some sort of charge.

647
01:04:04,998 --> 01:04:12,463
And I know that some of the slideshow may acknowledge some of what we want in the charge anyway, and we can sit and review it in January.

648
01:04:15,114 --> 01:04:16,014
Member Graham, sorry.

649
01:04:17,555 --> 01:04:21,637
I was actually gonna suggest that we not put that on the superintendent.

650
01:04:21,717 --> 01:04:24,798
She has lots of things to do.

651
01:04:25,378 --> 01:04:31,461
But, and you know, we've talked extensively about like how many things we're asking the superintendent to do.

652
01:04:31,581 --> 01:04:41,805
And I think this is an example of something that as a committee, we could say, you know, there's like, I don't know, there's three or four pieces of this and could individual committee members take a shot at it

653
01:04:42,182 --> 01:04:43,763
and bring something to the next meeting.

654
01:04:43,823 --> 01:04:45,743
I think that's a really fair way to do it.

655
01:04:47,224 --> 01:04:56,788
As long as the committee agrees with that approach, I don't see why we can't each individual, you know, take a part and write something down.

656
01:04:56,868 --> 01:04:58,008
So there's something to look at.

657
01:04:58,028 --> 01:05:08,173
I, you know, I think it would be luxurious for Maurice to have the time to have a half hour conversation with each of us about our wants and our needs, but you know, we,

658
01:05:09,731 --> 01:05:12,433
she has really pressing things to do as well.

659
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:27,685
So I would be happy to take on a piece of the work, but I want to make sure that the entire committee is on board with who's going to do what and that it's just simply a draft and a starting point so we can have a productive conversation.

660
01:05:27,725 --> 01:05:28,825
So that's just another idea.

661
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:30,767
I just assumed that

662
01:05:31,271 --> 01:05:33,592
Dr. Edward Vincent would kind of delegate that.

663
01:05:33,612 --> 01:05:39,013
I know Mr. Fallon, Mr. DeLava have done a lot to prepare for tonight, Dr. Cushing.

664
01:05:39,253 --> 01:05:44,775
So it's up to the committee, Dr. Vincent, it's up to your feelings as well.

665
01:05:46,655 --> 01:05:51,717
Just listening to what was said, I was also thinking about the possibility of

666
01:05:52,788 --> 01:05:57,654
Sending some of the charge language to the subcommittee building and ground subcommittee.

667
01:05:57,674 --> 01:06:03,642
And I was thinking, maybe we could carve out a chunk of time at a pre existing meeting.

668
01:06:04,483 --> 01:06:09,088
If that's a possibility of the top of my head right now I can't remember everyone who's on that committee and.

669
01:06:11,852 --> 01:06:21,195
I don't mind the coordination in working with the principals, working with Susie to at least begin to move the work forward.

670
01:06:21,735 --> 01:06:30,937
And the second slide deck was kind of trying to capture ideas of how it could possibly look, which is a draft.

671
01:06:31,397 --> 01:06:33,258
So I can definitely send that to everyone.

672
01:06:34,810 --> 01:06:41,532
And if we were able to bring it to subcommittee, I don't have the calendar in front of me right now.

673
01:06:41,552 --> 01:06:44,573
If a team member might be able to look at the date.

674
01:06:45,173 --> 01:06:53,815
So when we have like our next building and ground subcommittee, if that was one way, or it could go to one of the other subcommittees so that we could

675
01:06:54,615 --> 01:07:03,281
Divvy up the work so that not any one member was you know burdened with carrying a heavier load than others.

676
01:07:03,701 --> 01:07:07,224
So some of it could be under communications subcommittee.

677
01:07:07,304 --> 01:07:10,466
We could bring a portion of that under communications.

678
01:07:10,586 --> 01:07:14,089
A portion could also be under building and ground subcommittee.

679
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:18,372
Divide up the work and through subcommittee you would have at least

680
01:07:18,932 --> 01:07:44,970
three members working together so you would have like three voices contributing to you know one chunk of it and then I could work on the coordination piece of you know the different meetings and you know bringing it together to say this you know this is a potential draft and present it at a regular meeting that's just another another way to give people an opportunity to

681
01:07:47,586 --> 01:07:56,234
work in a team without violating open meeting law, or work collaboratively as opposed to doing the giant Google Doc.

682
01:07:58,436 --> 01:07:58,936
Member Rousseau?

683
01:07:58,976 --> 01:08:02,960
I feel like we have a lot of options.

684
01:08:04,099 --> 01:08:10,945
Um, and, um, I guess, you know, for me, it's like the, the strategy group, it seems really relevant.

685
01:08:11,185 --> 01:08:16,430
Uh, the equity group that, you know, the equity subcommittee that I have seems relevant, the buildings.

686
01:08:17,110 --> 01:08:19,292
I feel like they all end up having a piece of it.

687
01:08:19,772 --> 01:08:26,918
And, and, um, I think a really good charge statement can't be four pages long.

688
01:08:26,938 --> 01:08:31,002
Uh, you know, when we ask for applicants, one page is good.

689
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:33,501
And that's going to include everything you're going to fill in.

690
01:08:33,982 --> 01:08:37,144
So I mean, anything more than a paragraph is probably too much.

691
01:08:37,885 --> 01:08:41,667
And I mean, I don't have any evidence that that's the right amount.

692
01:08:41,787 --> 01:08:47,972
But so I just feel that if we send it off to the various subcommittees,

693
01:08:48,607 --> 01:09:07,073
they're either gonna all add their spin, you know, the strategy group is gonna think all about strategy, buildings and grounds are gonna think all about physical plant, the equity, the subcommittee that I have will add several sentences about the importance of equity and understanding how we get different people in the community involved.

694
01:09:07,513 --> 01:09:16,376
And then this charge statement will be so long that people won't even apply because they won't have time to finish reading what it is we're gonna ask them to do.

695
01:09:17,056 --> 01:09:30,746
I mean, so I just, I feel strongly like it needs, I mean, I feel strongly it needs to be as short as possible and as, I don't want to say vague, that's not really the right word, but not as non-prescriptive as possible.

696
01:09:31,666 --> 01:09:35,909
And, you know, sending it to subcommittee means the subcommittee will have to meet.

697
01:09:36,369 --> 01:09:42,334
And just like the full committee, not even two of those members of the subcommittee can open a Google Doc and work together.

698
01:09:42,494 --> 01:09:45,856
They have to, maybe the chair does it before the meeting,

699
01:09:46,475 --> 01:09:50,616
and then they can talk about it in the meeting, because the open meeting law does apply.

700
01:09:50,677 --> 01:09:57,879
I hate that, but I did ask Howard about that last year, because I was very confused how we could work as a subcommittee with open meeting law.

701
01:09:58,419 --> 01:10:05,882
So I just feel like it'll just make it so that the subcommittee will meet, then they will have to send it to the full committee.

702
01:10:06,613 --> 01:10:12,458
And then we will all have something to say, and then it will go either back to the subcommittee, to a different subcommittee.

703
01:10:12,478 --> 01:10:16,401
I just think we'll be in March before we even come close to a statement.

704
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:23,287
So that's just my opinion on sending it off to a subcommittee.

705
01:10:25,188 --> 01:10:26,729
So Mr. DeLeva.

706
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:27,550
Sorry.

707
01:10:31,815 --> 01:10:32,655
Sorry, I forgot to unmute.

708
01:10:32,675 --> 01:10:35,056
I think we're all just zoomed out here for a little bit.

709
01:10:35,737 --> 01:10:46,161
So what I'm hearing from member Russo, which no different than what we're doing at the high school is I think it's more of you coming up with a mission for this particular group.

710
01:10:46,301 --> 01:10:49,203
What is the mission statement for this group?

711
01:10:49,943 --> 01:10:53,225
Then they can come together and do like the vision stuff, right?

712
01:10:53,545 --> 01:10:55,025
Am I understanding that?

713
01:10:57,566 --> 01:10:58,247
If I might, mayor.

714
01:10:59,456 --> 01:11:09,263
Yeah, I mean, the policy statement, our policy says that the assignment the school committee wishes the committee to fulfill and the extent and limitations of its responsibility.

715
01:11:09,303 --> 01:11:22,634
So yeah, I mean, that's why I think that it's probably not actually as hard as we're thinking it will be, because, you know, we will probably have to debate things like, you know, Paul's all about this, whatever the options are have to be carbon neutral.

716
01:11:22,694 --> 01:11:25,876
And if everybody else, if not a majority of us agree, then that comes out.

717
01:11:26,897 --> 01:11:27,077
But,

718
01:11:28,723 --> 01:11:36,108
you know, things like keep it under $150 million, like those aren't gonna be in the vision statement probably because that's really just so perspective.

719
01:11:37,869 --> 01:11:40,390
Mr. Delivery, you're all set.

720
01:11:41,471 --> 01:11:43,272
Dr. Edward-Vincent and member Van de Kloot.

721
01:11:44,353 --> 01:11:49,136
Yes, so what I was gonna say in regards to having it

722
01:11:50,347 --> 01:11:52,028
go and have the respective groups.

723
01:11:52,728 --> 01:11:53,308
I truly am.

724
01:11:53,648 --> 01:12:10,776
Member Rousseau, where you have a draft charge already written, I am willing to be the keeper of the knowledge and send it to everyone and take feedback and revisions.

725
01:12:10,896 --> 01:12:20,020
I'm willing to do that so that I will be able to work on it, share it with the team, and see if all of those pieces can kind of come together

726
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:30,665
into one inclusive charge statement and keep in mind that the charge should not be longer than one page.

727
01:12:30,685 --> 01:12:34,066
So I'm definitely willing to do that.

728
01:12:34,206 --> 01:12:36,808
I'm willing to do that piece of the work.

729
01:12:37,028 --> 01:12:47,693
And then once we are able to come up with an official charge, the next phase of the work would be to include that charge

730
01:12:48,313 --> 01:13:01,622
you know, on the application process, but also to include what the specific subgroupings could be so that as people try to determine whether they're interested in terms of the time commitment in those pieces.

731
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:17,554
So I am willing to do phase one of keeping that charge and trying to at least get the charge done and be able to present it back to you as a committee.

732
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:28,860
And hopefully, by the end of January, everyone will have been able to have weighed in so that we'll be able to move on to the next phase at that point in time.

733
01:13:35,904 --> 01:13:41,148
I want to ask member Rousseau to read what he had read at the beginning, his charge.

734
01:13:42,649 --> 01:13:43,790
Paul, can you just repeat it?

735
01:13:43,810 --> 01:13:46,652
Sure.

736
01:13:47,533 --> 01:13:48,874
And I'll paste it into the chat.

737
01:13:48,914 --> 01:13:49,595
Is chat open?

738
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:49,915
It is.

739
01:13:49,935 --> 01:13:56,500
Let me just paste it in first so I can find the text.

740
01:13:57,329 --> 01:14:08,074
The Medford High School Vision Advisory Committee shall work to understand and state clearly the possible options to provide Medford with a high school that can suit our educational and other needs for the next 50 years.

741
01:14:08,134 --> 01:14:11,296
The options may only include those that will be carbon neutral or better.

742
01:14:12,076 --> 01:14:18,500
The advisory committee shall provide quarterly reports to the school committee with a presentation at the conclusion of the service.

743
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:23,022
And it's worth noting that there are six sections that we have to fill in.

744
01:14:24,122 --> 01:14:24,823
One of them is,

745
01:14:26,124 --> 01:14:28,505
The first one is like, how long are we asking them?

746
01:14:29,145 --> 01:14:33,286
And my suggestion was we just say a year with a possibility of an extension of six months.

747
01:14:34,386 --> 01:14:41,989
And then section C asks for the resources that we shall provide to the advisory committee.

748
01:14:42,229 --> 01:14:53,592
And in my suggestion, I said the superintendent shall provide reports as requested by a majority vote of the advisory committee, unless the superintendent believes the report request is burdensome.

749
01:14:54,272 --> 01:15:04,345
Should a report request be considered burdensome the advisory committee may request that the request may request that the request be placed on the next school committee agenda for discussion and consideration.

750
01:15:05,851 --> 01:15:11,334
resource request shall be considered on a case by case basis and made to the school committee at the next scheduled meeting.

751
01:15:11,374 --> 01:15:26,322
So in that I was envisioning, you know, if the advisory committee once fully constituted recognizes that, you know, we need, we really, let's pretend they need to have a site survey done by a company that'll cost $20,000.

752
01:15:28,072 --> 01:15:30,574
and that they, without that, they don't feel they can move forward.

753
01:15:30,594 --> 01:15:32,115
I'm just making that up.

754
01:15:33,395 --> 01:15:39,019
They would obviously have to come to us and say, we need this, can you pay for it?

755
01:15:39,899 --> 01:15:47,084
And then there was a section E, which was about, section E is one of the most weird sentences.

756
01:15:47,144 --> 01:15:51,727
I won't read the whole thing, cause it's quite long, but I essentially think what it's trying to say is,

757
01:15:52,487 --> 01:16:05,175
you know, it's around conflicts of interest and making sure that we don't just have a vision committee consisting of all of the staff of the buildings and grounds department, or, you know, that wouldn't be a conflict of interest.

758
01:16:06,656 --> 01:16:12,799
And the last one is section F, which is responsibility for release of information to the press.

759
01:16:12,899 --> 01:16:22,205
And my suggestion was the chair of the advisory committee shall be responsible for press contact just so that

760
01:16:22,598 --> 01:16:28,686
you know, with any kind of a committee, everybody will not agree all the time.

761
01:16:29,507 --> 01:16:34,534
And to keep things nice, it would make sense if one person is the press contact.

762
01:16:35,676 --> 01:16:36,497
So that's what I had.

763
01:16:37,186 --> 01:16:56,089
Thank you, Paul, you know personally I think that's a fine starting point to be able to I mean, to take what Paul has has written and for us that to deliberate on it to give feedback to the superintendent and, and, you know, for us to

764
01:16:57,050 --> 01:17:04,514
you know, then if she could develop some way to share that with us, and then I think that would make sense.

765
01:17:05,134 --> 01:17:16,980
And while I can understand Jenny's concern about not Maurice having too much, I think it's absolutely critical that Maurice does play a strong role in this development.

766
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:19,421
So I think that works.

767
01:17:20,401 --> 01:17:21,982
You know, I like Paul's starting point.

768
01:17:22,662 --> 01:17:23,182
personally.

769
01:17:23,202 --> 01:17:33,386
I think it's a good place to begin with, it's solid, but yet there's also a lot of potentials for discussion as well.

770
01:17:34,506 --> 01:17:51,612
Okay, so is there a motion on the floor that will use Paul's starter draft as a way to, you know, take a few weeks and review and send potential additions, edits to superintendent and our staff,

771
01:17:52,232 --> 01:17:59,495
to then compile a charge that we will review by the end of January.

772
01:18:01,416 --> 01:18:02,457
We don't even have to put a timeframe.

773
01:18:02,497 --> 01:18:04,278
I know- So moved.

774
01:18:04,298 --> 01:18:07,439
20 other Committee of the Whole meetings, but sometime after the new year.

775
01:18:08,279 --> 01:18:08,780
So moved.

776
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:13,982
Moved by member Van de Kloet, seconded by- Second.

777
01:18:14,482 --> 01:18:15,983
Member Rousseau, roll call.

778
01:18:18,524 --> 01:18:19,104
Jenny Graham?

779
01:18:19,825 --> 01:18:20,005
Yes.

780
01:18:21,024 --> 01:18:21,645
Cathy Kretsch?

781
01:18:22,165 --> 01:18:22,365
Yes.

782
01:18:23,386 --> 01:18:24,307
Melanie McLaughlin?

783
01:18:24,687 --> 01:18:25,007
Yes.

784
01:18:26,128 --> 01:18:26,829
Mia Mastone?

785
01:18:27,309 --> 01:18:27,569
Yes.

786
01:18:28,090 --> 01:18:28,790
Paul Rousseau?

787
01:18:29,891 --> 01:18:30,071
Yes.

788
01:18:31,472 --> 01:18:32,313
Paulette Vander Kloot?

789
01:18:32,333 --> 01:18:32,613
Yes.

790
01:18:34,235 --> 01:18:35,155
Mayor Lungo Kern?

791
01:18:35,636 --> 01:18:35,876
Yes.

792
01:18:35,936 --> 01:18:38,378
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

793
01:18:38,418 --> 01:18:39,359
The paper passes.

794
01:18:39,579 --> 01:18:46,725
And then also, if the administration could just send us all the second slideshow so we can use that to help, that would be great.

795
01:18:47,325 --> 01:18:49,547
And thank you for that, the administration.

796
01:18:50,184 --> 01:18:51,925
Yes, thank you for the two slide decks.

797
01:18:51,945 --> 01:18:52,925
That was helpful.

798
01:18:53,305 --> 01:18:55,326
I know we received the first one.

799
01:18:55,386 --> 01:18:58,888
We'll get the second one, and we can maybe even put them on the website.

800
01:19:00,129 --> 01:19:00,929
Member McLaughlin?

801
01:19:01,749 --> 01:19:09,833
And I just wanted to say thank you, Dr. Edward Vincent, for being the keeper of the information and reintegrating it and reorganizing it.

802
01:19:09,853 --> 01:19:13,035
We appreciate that, especially with everything that we know is going on.

803
01:19:13,135 --> 01:19:14,515
So thank you.

804
01:19:14,876 --> 01:19:16,697
And I make a motion to adjourn.

805
01:19:17,437 --> 01:19:19,738
Yes, and our next regular meeting

01:19:20,562 --> 01:19:24,223
full of holiday chair will be Monday, the 21st.

807
01:19:26,043 --> 01:19:28,584
So everyone's wearing their Christmas pajamas?

808
01:19:28,644 --> 01:19:29,544
Is that what I heard, Mayor?

809
01:19:29,644 --> 01:19:31,324
A police sweater contest.

810
01:19:32,585 --> 01:19:32,965
All right.

811
01:19:33,125 --> 01:19:33,605
You're on.

812
01:19:33,645 --> 01:19:33,865
You're on.

813
01:19:33,965 --> 01:19:34,725
I must object.

814
01:19:34,945 --> 01:19:35,725
I must object.

815
01:19:35,925 --> 01:19:36,286
I can't.

816
01:19:36,646 --> 01:19:37,626
Come on.

817
01:19:38,866 --> 01:19:39,246
OK.

818
01:19:39,426 --> 01:19:40,366
I'll meet you there, Mayor.

819
01:19:40,827 --> 01:19:41,087
OK.

820
01:19:41,107 --> 01:19:41,607
Let's do it.

821
01:19:42,087 --> 01:19:42,487
All right.

822
01:19:42,827 --> 01:19:44,627
I'm going to take Scott's sweater.

823
01:19:44,707 --> 01:19:45,387
He's got a good one.

824
01:19:45,428 --> 01:19:45,948
It lights up.
