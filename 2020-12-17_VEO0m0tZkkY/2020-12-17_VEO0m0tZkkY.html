    <p>[Paul D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=183.88s">Hello</a>  everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=186.483s">I</a>  think, Chad and I will piggyback back and forth on on this presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=194.46s">Just</a>  before we get started, I know there's going to be discussions regarding, you know, the relaunching of the vision committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=203.762s">There's</a>  been some things in the past that have been sort of set up and, you know, I guess some of the things we were talking about, are we talking about like renovations to the building or are we talking more vision stuff? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=216.606s">But</a>  I think we're going to show you what we've currently done so far so that when you are making that decision of, <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=222.247s">where</a>  you're going or which direction you're going regarding what has been done recently at the high school, which many of you are already aware of, as well as at the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=232.418s">So</a>  we can go to the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=239.044s">So,</a>  you know, some of the projects that you are aware of obviously, you know, the swimming pool had been redone. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=245.828s">A</a>  few years ago we just recently got the new gymnasium floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=249.971s">My</a>  first year here, the science labs were completed in 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=255.392s">Now</a>  with the COVID CARES Act money, things that have been improvement is our HVAC system. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=262.958s">We</a>  are still in working on the student bathrooms that are in progress and the new boilers that were funded by the MSBA grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=274.117s">So</a>  as you can see here, little pictures of our swimming pool, as well as our floor that's partnered with Lesley University. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=282.623s">I</a>  know many of you have been there already. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=284.384s">So</a>  that's one thing that we are quite proud of that has been improved throughout the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=290.368s">Move</a>  on. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=294.951s">Now,</a>  you gotta be impressed with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=296.912s">I</a>  was actually on the roof to get these pictures. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=300.541s">But</a>  I wanted to make sure that it was clear that the swap outs were just recently happening with our go green contractor that has been doing improvements for fans as well as air conditioning and air exchanges. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=316.606s">So</a>  I wanted to make sure you got a picture of some of the units that have been already installed on the newer end. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=322.188s">If</a>  you look more to that left picture, you'll also see that the venting and the piping has been improved as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=332.981s">Next</a>  one. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=334.882s">Many</a>  of you are aware of our science lab areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=337.043s">Each</a>  science lab has a prep room area as well as a regular science lab area, which again, through MSBA grant funding that happened around 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=347.87s">And</a>  then of course we have our biotech area that's part of the science lab as well that many of you have visited through the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=363.936s">And</a>  Chad's going to take over on the vocational side I know you've seen some of this presentation before but. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=370.525s">he's</a>  got more updated pieces to what he's been doing on the vocational side.</p>

    <p>[Fallon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=374.246s">Thanks,</a>  Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=375.406s">So</a>  I definitely am thrilled that I can beef up my resume. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=378.687s">Not</a>  that I'm going anywhere, but who knew four years ago when I took this job, I'd be in my fourth or fifth project here in the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=385.169s">So</a>  it's really cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=386.03s">I'm</a>  glad to be able to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=388.11s">We</a>  have done a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=389.17s">Every</a>  time we take on a project, though, I have to tell you, and I always make the joke with usually whoever's in my six-foot radius, <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=397.833s">every</a>  time I do these projects I worry I like see this wrecking ball in my mind thinking with my luck I'll finish the new salon you know the marble was just put in and we'll get we'll get funding for a new school and in comes the wrecking ball and I'll be standing there guarding the marble that I that I took from the girls locker room <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=413.139s">So</a>  it's always a risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=415.623s">Luckily,</a>  all the work we do, we have been lucky, we have private donors, it's grant funded, a lot of the stuff we can take with us, but there are some things that obviously we're doing to the physical plant that can't be taken with us if we were to leave this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=428.49s">With</a>  that said, and getting to know the building more over four years and kind of seeing the structure when it's exposed, there are a lot of good, I do think it has good bones. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=439.278s">I</a>  think the HVAC systems were something that were gonna need to be done regardless. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=444.362s">Whether</a>  the building can last us another 50 years, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=446.843s">But</a>  the projects we're doing now are at least revitalizing the space, making it safe, making it up to code. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=454.509s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=457.633s">Hopefully</a>  it will buy us some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=460.854s">So</a>  a quick update, I did give this at the Buildings and Grounds Subcommittee, so I won't get into detail, but metal fabrication and welding was painted, walls and ceilings. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=470.398s">That</a>  was a no-cost job. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=472.119s">We</a>  have finished, at least for now, our LED lighting projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=475.26s">We</a>  were able to do five different programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=477.021s">That</a>  was $100,000 plus in grant funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=480.943s">That's</a>  also a cost savings to the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=483.064s">So</a>  we have five of our programs with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=485.225s">Paul,</a>  you can go to the next slide.</p>

    <p>[Paul D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=487.167s">I'm</a>  not in control of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=488.308s">Oh,</a>  sorry, Paul.</p>

    <p>[Fallon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=491.269s">Robotics</a>  and Engineering is fully complete at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=493.69s">We</a>  have a very small punch list. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=495.07s">We</a>  have to do a few items before that's finished, but that space is very much inhabitable. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=500.613s">That</a>  was through the Skills Capital Grant, $287,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=502.874s">The</a>  final thing for the HVAC down there right now is to get the unit going in the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=509.116s">We</a>  have new heat, and that also has windows and doors that open. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=515.259s">Next.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=516.125s">just</a>  some more pictures of robotics, the finished product. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=521.569s">In</a>  programming and web development, we moved that program to a bigger space, which was the former robotics and engineering program, spent about 16,000 on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=529.654s">Those</a>  are all items that could be moved if needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=531.835s">That</a>  was through a partnership with the Furniture Trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=534.677s">So</a>  25 new workstations, new carpet, paint, and new computers that we bought through Perkins funding last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=545.637s">In</a>  the former programming and web room, we made that a construction technology lab that will be shared by metal fabrication, construction and craft laborers in carpentry. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=555.023s">The</a>  desks were built by the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=556.564s">We</a>  used wood that was just made out of pine. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=559.306s">It</a>  wasn't anything expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=561.067s">And</a>  you can see that the teachers made a demonstration desk as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=564.349s">We</a>  did this prior to COVID, but it actually lent itself well to our current situation because students aren't directly next to each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=570.293s">Next</a>  slide, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=573.257s">So</a>  the cosmetology salon is just about finished. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=576.218s">These</a>  are some pictures of the process over the last year, really. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=581.2s">If</a>  you go to the next slide, I can show you where we're at now. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=584.28s">The</a>  floor will be finished by this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=586.461s">The</a>  marble from the girls' locker room has been retrofitted for this space. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=590.582s">If</a>  you flip to the next slide, we can show you the current pictures.</p>

    <p>[Paul D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=595.964s">Dr.</a>  Cushing.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=596.604s">Dr.</a>  Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=597.925s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fallon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=599.295s">So</a>  much like we did in the bistro, we took more remnants of the marble that was in the locker room. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=603.797s">And</a>  we did basically a 25 foot countertop, if you will, in the middle of the salon. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=609.48s">And</a>  that's gonna be 12 workstations for the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=612.522s">We</a>  use the marble above the sink on that lower picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=615.343s">And</a>  the picture in the middle is a picture of the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=617.985s">And</a>  then the picture on the right is one of our instructors with students just last week, putting the fascia trim on the workstations. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=627.436s">Automotive</a>  technology, this was really the stars aligned on this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=631.678s">This</a>  was a combination of the students not being in the space allowed us to empty everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=636.74s">I</a>  shouldn't say we allowed the teachers to empty everything out of the shop, which was a huge project. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=642.562s">This</a>  shop hadn't been touched in years. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=644.243s">And</a>  we put down a high grade airport quality floor down in that space. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=649.425s">That</a>  would have been no doubt $100,000 job that we were able to get as no cost because of our partnership with the Painters Union. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=656.988s">Sherman</a>  Williams donated the paint. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=658.65s">So</a>  really when all was said and done, the only thing I paid for was to have the ceiling painted by a contractor after the fact, because I didn't dare ask the painters union back. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=668.518s">They</a>  were moving on to another project with the apprentices. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=670.66s">So</a>  we did that ourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=672.602s">That</a>  was about $10,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=673.423s">So</a>  all I had to spend for this project was about $10,000 for the painting of the ceiling. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=677.586s">If</a>  you go to the next slide, you can see. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=680.95s">So</a>  with the new lighting, the ceiling and the floor, the new lifts, automotive technology is now one of our newest programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=687.215s">And</a>  last year with Perkins funding, we upgraded some machinery and products for the shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=693.02s">So</a>  now we're up to NATF standards in this program as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=697.143s">Next.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=698.084s">And</a>  that's an update from our side.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=707.671s">Great,</a>  member McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=711.352s">I</a>  just wanted to say it looks great, Chad. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=713.333s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=714.194s">I</a>  got a little bit of a tour before COVID, and I was just so impressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=719.257s">It</a>  had been my first time for a walk around. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=720.998s">So</a>  it just looks so good, and it's exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=724.92s">And</a>  I can't wait to see the salon all done. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=727.301s">And</a>  I'm sure your students can't wait to get in there.</p>

    <p>[Fallon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=729.943s">Yeah,</a>  it's going to be nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=731.023s">Thank</a>  you for your support.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=739.383s">Dr.</a>  Cushing, do you have another slide deck?</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=742.025s">That</a>  is the slide deck we have right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=749.73s">We</a>  have begun work on another slide deck to really look at how we would go about really setting a vision, the type of work that should be done to go through, kind of like Mr. DeLava was saying at the start, really establishing <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=766.984s">the</a>  vision for what we want Medford High School to be so that the physical structure then meets those needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=778.593s">But</a>  I see Mr. Russo has his hand up.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=781.115s">Hi,</a>  thank you for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=783.736s">I</a>  have to admit confusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=786.739s">It</a>  seemed that I wasn't on the agenda, so I was a little confused by that, but so <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=794.002s">that</a>  all seems like really important information for the vision committee to consider when they do their work. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=799.564s">And</a>  I'm glad that we have actually put it all together on a list. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=803.265s">I</a>  think that that'll be helpful for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=807.846s">Just</a>  wondering, so are we moving on to the policy to fill out the required six items that we have to hand off to the vision committee?</p>

    <p>[Paul D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=824.005s">So</a>  can I ask a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=825.765s">Is</a>  that okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=828.006s">Because</a>  the inception of the vision committee is where I, you know, I've gone through my previous emails and it really started under a different administration regarding building improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=842.629s">And</a>  Mia, I know you're quoted actually in the press release as well as the application process. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=849.69s">for</a>  that. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=850.211s">And</a>  I think what I'm trying to get a grasp on is, it sounds like we're reforming the vision committee, but we haven't set the actual standards for what that vision committee is. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=863.945s">Because</a>  there was a selection that was made and then it was decided that we would reopen the application process. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=871.576s">which</a>  totally is understandable. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=873.198s">I</a>  just, I think that's where the crux of where I am stuck as the principle of where this is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=880.389s">So</a>  I'm glad we're having this committee of the whole, cause I'm a little.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=884.085s">And</a>  Paul, you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=886.006s">I</a>  think it was, well, now looking back, it was an oversight, because it was kind of Kathy and I transitioning, and Kathy was really the one who thought of a vision committee, and that's when she came on as chair of the buildings committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=899.934s">So</a>  really, Kathy, I don't know if you, you probably remember better than I do, because it was the vocational teacher who had come up and has presented when the buildings committee, I think it was the last meeting we transitioned together.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=913.076s">Yeah,</a>  it was Mr. Brown. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=915.338s">It</a>  was actually his idea, and he proposed and shared some ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=921.223s">He</a>  reached out to me this week to see if I had a copy of his proposal, which I don't have it, but it was all great information. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=929.389s">And</a>  he actually has over, it looks like over, he has 35 years in the construction industry, seven years at Medford Vocational Technical High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=940.458s">He</a>  also has eight years in, <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=943.3s">manufacturing</a>  and design. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=945.782s">So,</a>  you know, he actually came up with the idea and shared some, you know, some like a brief presentation at that building and grounds meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=955.029s">And</a>  I have a copy of the minutes, but it doesn't have a copy of the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=959.052s">Like</a>  I actually pulled out the minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=961.053s">I</a>  saved them, but I don't have a copy of his proposal, but I think it was more along, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=967.958s">What</a>  were we gonna go, you know, were we gonna do renovations or was it going to be a new school? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=974.664s">But</a>  I think like with everything going on right now, all the updates that are going on, including the HVAC and the boiler and all the vocational updates, you know, I think it might be best to go forward with this committee, you know, for a renovation for the high school, you know, almost like a refurbish the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=996.684s">And</a>  I think also the trouble that we had earlier was that, you know, we didn't have a diverse group. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1003.866s">So</a>  that's why it was disbanded. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1006.687s">And</a>  we need to just, I guess, the mayor and the committee, we just need to, I think, come up with an application process and maybe a lottery process to choose the very select, you know, diverse group. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1019.991s">And</a>  that's what, you know, that's what I remember so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1024.373s">Thank</a>  you, Member Kreatz.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1025.313s">Member</a>  Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1027.08s">So</a>  I think when we disbanded this committee, we talked about the fact that, you know, one of the, you know, among the challenges in the way that the committee was formed is that we did not have a diverse cross section of residents participating, but that really that was because we weren't following our own rules about how to establish such a committee and <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1050.9s">I</a>  think we need to go back to the beginning of that process and say, which is what we agreed we would do, and say, what is the scope of this committee that we're asking? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1061.702s">And</a>  therefore, how many people do we need? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1064.483s">And</a>  what is the time frame? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1065.803s">And</a>  what do we expect from them? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1067.304s">And</a>  what parameters are we providing to them so that they can then go off and do their exploratory <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1073.743s">work,</a>  whatever that work might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1075.743s">But</a>  it would be hugely irresponsible of this committee to say, we just because we have done stuff in recent times that we shouldn't at least examine what all of our options are. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1088.145s">Because</a>  when you are retrofitting a building, it is often far more expensive than something new. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1094.887s">Sometimes</a>  it's not, but none of us is qualified to make that decision, but none of us is qualified to make that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1100.247s">So</a>  we should, I think we need to proceed with <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1104.1s">plans</a>  that we had in place to sort of examine those as options. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1107.422s">So</a>  what Mr. Brown presented to us back at that meeting because I was in attendance was that there's really three options. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1115.367s">One</a>  is to renovate in place and to do that a little bit at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1119.63s">That's</a>  one option. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1121.051s">The</a>  other was to build something new on site. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1126.675s">So</a>  basically stand up a new structure and then ultimately the current one goes away. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1132.038s">The</a>  third option was <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1134.404s">not</a>  to build on site at all, but to find some other site or location and explore what that would look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1141.672s">And</a>  I think each of those three things at this point in time, based on what we don't know, are just as viable as the last thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1152.133s">I</a>  think, you know, in terms of the scope of the committee, we need to not limit them and we need to, as a committee, not limit our thinking about how we're going to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1162.279s">And</a>  I hear that all the time when the discussion of vision committee comes up is people say, well, we did this work six years ago, so we can't possibly consider doing something different. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1171.684s">I</a>  think that's an expensive assumption potentially. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1175.507s">And</a>  I don't feel like we are, <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1178.204s">rolling</a>  in dough as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1179.985s">So</a>  we owe it to the community to make really astute, smart decisions about what's in the best interest of our vision, which we don't have at the moment, and how we get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1191.469s">So</a>  I do think if we go back to the beginning of forming an advisory committee and talk about the scope, that will lead us to questions like, <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1200.069s">just</a>  how big should the committee be, who should be on the committee, what kind of skills do we need, and then we can get to the point of how do we have an application process that allows us to ensure that we have a representative group of people on the various components of the committee to do the work that we have asked them to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1221.169s">a</a>  framing of the work and an expectation of what we need from people. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1224.632s">I</a>  think it's really hard to expect people to just blindly sign up for something where we can't say it's this many hours, it's this many months, it's this much time. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1235.059s">And</a>  I think there's a lot of facets to this process that perhaps the committee needs to be quite large because there need to be subcommittees. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1242.625s">And</a>  I think that's what we should be talking about today, not about whether or not we are gonna do X or Y or Z because none of us is qualified to make those decisions.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1254.362s">Member</a>  McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1257.803s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1258.923s">Also,</a>  I just, you know, this was sort of a tricky thing in that it was a crossover between two administrations, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1268.145s">And</a>  so, and also two new school committee members and new central administration and a whole bunch of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1275.827s">And</a>  so I think really sort of getting an understanding again to Member Graham's point and also <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1281.368s">Member</a>  Kretsch's point, getting an understanding both of what the intention was under the former administration and the former school committee when this was established initially to, you know, again, what the intent is today, you know, what that looks like, what our policy <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1299.138s">suggest</a>  we do when we're making this sort of an ad hoc committee and again to member Graham's point what the you know what the individuals who should be what the selection process is and what we're looking for in terms of expertise because I also don't feel like necessarily a vision committee I certainly I think a vision committee will be able to do it sounds like what we're asking them to do is you know research walkthroughs you know cost analysis potentially I mean I don't really know because we haven't spelled that out <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1328.447s">But</a>  even among those people it doesn't necessarily mean that we're going to have experts per se, unless that's what we're saying is we're looking for community based experts and if that's what we're saying, as opposed to community members who are submitting applications then I think we need some clarification on that too but I just want to make sure that those who are watching or those who watch later. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1348.401s">community</a>  members, what have you, understand that this is something that has crossed two administrations and several school committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1358.866s">So</a>  we're all playing a little bit of catch up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1361.588s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1364.709s">Member</a>  Ruseau, and then I know the admin did work on a slide deck that isn't fully ready, but maybe we can, I think that would go to intention and scope. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1374.814s">Member</a>  Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1376.375s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1377.512s">I</a>  was there and my memory is that it was, let's do a vision committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1382.013s">And</a>  that was as far as we really got on what we meant. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1385.754s">I</a>  think this committee can decide what we mean and what was bent then is sort of not relevant. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1392.555s">It</a>  certainly would be good if it was, if there was a clear statement, I'd be all for like, let's dig it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1398.156s">But</a>  my memory was there wasn't a clear statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1400.916s">And</a>  so now it's time for us to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1403.197s">And</a>  twice in the last, <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1405.37s">Earlier</a>  today, as well as in February, I sent a clear statement of what I thought as a sort of a starting point for what that item B, which is the assignment the school committee wishes the committee to fulfill and the extent and limitations of its responsibilities, which is in our policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1422.212s">This</a>  is the essentially the scope and charter, what is it we want them to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1427.481s">And,</a>  you know, I just drafted something since I felt it was important to that we could have something to respond to if you obviously if there are other <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1436.91s">Other</a>  ideas, that's fine too, but mine is pretty short. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1440.351s">It</a>  says that the Medford High School Vision Advisory Committee shall work to understand and state clearly the possible options for providing Medford with a high school that can suit our educational and other needs for the next 50 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1452.613s">The</a>  options may only include those that will be carbon neutral or better. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1457.074s">The</a>  advisory committee shall provide quarterly reports to the school committee with a presentation at the conclusion of service. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1464.0s">other</a>  than the part about carbon neutrality and the setting of a, you know, what's the window of time we're talking about here? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1471.185s">50</a>  years from now, I'm guessing building technology will be so remarkably different than today that it seemed like a good timeframe, 50 years, that we've gotten 50 years out of this high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1484.713s">So,</a>  you know, that was just something that I put together and it was purposefully only really two points that are important to me <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1492.762s">is</a>  that we are not thinking in five and 10 year increments. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1495.983s">We're</a>  thinking 50 years and that we're not building something that will continue to destroy the earth as we just built a police station way up on the air. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1504.806s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1505.326s">Because</a>  it's gonna be flooding by the time this high school, if it was for 50 years, by the time this high school finishes its service. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1512.088s">So</a>  I get a little nervous about going any more specific because as member Graham said, I don't have <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1520.461s">any</a>  of the technical skills to know whether or not renovating and all that other stuff are necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1527.323s">But</a>  I also feel very strongly that we shouldn't be deciding ahead of time based on what we think the financial situation of the city will be in two, three, four, five, 10 years from now, when if there was a new high school, for instance, construction doesn't start a year from now. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1542.389s">I</a>  mean, we could be the richest community in the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1545.19s">We</a>  couldn't begin from now and have a groundbreaking a year from now. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1549.34s">So</a>  I think the financial part should be, here's what it would look like cost-wise. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1555.002s">And</a>  then we get those back and we in the community look at them and decide, okay, well, I mean, we can or can't afford this or what option do we want? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1564.485s">But</a>  I don't know what those options would look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1566.605s">So</a>  that's for me is where I feel like we need to start.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1573.775s">I</a>  wanted to share, good evening committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1576.076s">I</a>  did want to share that I did have the opportunity to work with both Principal DeLaver and Principal Fallon. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1583.978s">And</a>  as we were thinking and preparing for today's committee of the whole, we were kind of envisioning <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1592.688s">structure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1593.91s">It's</a>  a separate slide deck, but I would love the opportunity to be able to just share some of the thinking based on what different members have said this evening about how we need to think more broadly. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1608.386s">but</a>  also to say like these are some of the other possibilities that we've been thinking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1613.871s">The</a>  first slide deck that was presented was kind of, you know, in the absence of us not being able to, you know, meet in large groups and go on tours, it would really be wonderful for everyone to see the work that's happening, especially in Cosmo where it's like <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1630.765s">happening</a>  right now and it's just exciting to see the floors and everything feels new and you feel like it's HDTV and they should be videotaping everything that's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1641.708s">But</a>  I would love to be able to share this second deck with you which <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1651.736s">was</a>  our thinking about the vision, the vision planning, Dr. Cushing was involved as well, but this is more of a structured way. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1663.841s">But</a>  for those of you who like to kind of see it as a structure, this is a little more formal, but this is just a proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1671.764s">So</a>  it's in draft form, but this was kind of our best thinking as a team. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1679.668s">And</a>  thank you, Dr. Cushing, for starting the slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1683.234s">And</a>  I know since we're in this format, similar to what was said, <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1693.315s">In</a>  October of 19, I was new, just coming on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1696.557s">At</a>  that time, Mr. DeLava spoke to this, that we announced an official process for this master vision plan and how do we see Medford Public Schools evolving and changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1712.566s">And</a>  at that point in time, we also looked at our vocational programming, which is definitely playing an integral role <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1722.811s">envisioning.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1723.411s">And</a>  as you could see with all the programs that are being updated and enhanced and, you know, these are additional opportunities for our students, I truly, truly feel like there is such untapped potential on the vocational side of the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1740.862s">And</a>  you can proceed to the next slide, Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1747.454s">There's</a>  such potential and we are talking about how can we maximize the potential of the vocational side of the house for the entire comprehensive school community. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1761.337s">And</a>  start thinking outside of the box, start thinking innovatively and saying, how could Medford High School, our flagship building, re-envision itself? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1775.255s">And</a>  so I'm going to let Mr. Fallon, I'm going to let you jump in on the mission statement because we're in this mode. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1782.919s">It's</a>  hard to see where people are at, but I'm going to, I'm going to let you guys start and then I will support you because we all worked on this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1790.743s">Mr.</a>  Fallon, Mr. DeLava, either or.</p>

    <p>[Paul D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1793.384s">Well,</a>  so the mission statement, so I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1797.777s">One</a>  thing that we should note is there's been work within the building regarding NEASC, regarding our own is when we, when I first became principal here at the high school, that was one of the functions that we were doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1810.527s">And</a>  pre-COVID, we were sort of halfway there. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1813.309s">We</a>  were trying to get a vision statement of what a student that comes into Medford High School in ninth grade and what they should end up with out in 12th grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1822.716s">And</a>  that would have been our mantra, our whole, <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1827.093s">way</a>  of education through here at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1830.798s">And</a>  that also includes structural pieces within the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1835.185s">You</a>  know, I taught here. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1838.189s">Prior</a>  to the science labs. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1841.513s">find</a>  it very intriguing how they have turned out. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1844.695s">I</a>  think maybe I might have stayed in teaching more instead of going to administration knowing that those resources were going to be part of the learning process. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1856.003s">I</a>  mean that's a little bit of a joke but <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1858.411s">I'm</a>  happy where I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1859.531s">I</a>  just wanted to say that it is a good thing that when structure reflects the educational value, it's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1867.574s">So</a>  this mission statement has been changed through NEASC from the prior administration being here at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1875.997s">When</a>  NEASC comes around again, we'll be looking to rework it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1879.998s">But</a>  I think, you know, through the years, it's important that a mission statement basically is at the top of your head so I always still go back to the Andrews one, because I remember it excellence through responsibility and respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1892.305s">I</a>  think everybody knew that mantra. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1894.947s">going</a>  through. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1895.468s">And</a>  then again, new administration comes in and if they feel there's a different avenue for that, that happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1900.831s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fallon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1901.952s">Well,</a>  can I jump in?</p>

    <p>[Paul D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1903.133s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1903.373s">Go</a>  right ahead.</p>

    <p>[Fallon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1904.113s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1904.494s">So</a>  member Ruseau, thank you for also kind of framing the, the idea of what the vision committee is, because I think when, when we, when we, when we've been talking about this for a while but as, as kind of the team was discussing what this meant, <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1918.897s">We</a>  were trying to decide, so as an educator, when you hear vision, you think one thing, and that's usually how are teachers engaging with each other? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1925.324s">How</a>  are students responding to each other? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1926.906s">What's</a>  the conversation you hear in the hallways when you walk through between classes? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1930.79s">And</a>  Paul and I were able to think about what does our high school look like five years from now? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1935.595s">What</a>  did it look like 10 years ago? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1937.116s">What</a>  does it look like now? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1937.917s">And</a>  what are the things we want to change? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1939.739s">And</a>  so we were trying to distinguish. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1940.9s">So</a>  that's why it was helpful member or so when you kind of spoke to the fact that this vision committee was really formed for more than physical structure, perhaps. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1947.905s">Am</a>  I am I right to assume that that the vision committee was really tasked with the building itself?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1953.549s">It</a>  was a direct response to countless complaints about bathrooms that don't function. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1960.874s">I</a>  mean, we didn't even get into the fact that barely anything of that building is ADA compliant. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1967.018s">I</a>  mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1968.779s">You</a>  know, my son is just there this year, so obviously he isn't really there, but there's not many people in the community that don't think that the physical structure is in need of a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1983.252s">It</a>  was not in response to the education that's provided in any way, shape or form is my memory.</p>

    <p>[Fallon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=1988.489s">So</a>  when Paul and I were thinking about what what a high school of the future looks like, you know we started at the very bottom which was mission and vision, and you know a lot of the exercises last year that we had teachers being part of was really creating a shared vision, and that takes time, unfortunately it really does, but we're at the, we're at the point now where we felt like. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2006.467s">However,</a>  this team is made up whoever the stakeholders end up being Paul and I would be, you know, have active roles because this is the school that we're going to be at this is the school that we want to see bring into the, you know, bring into the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2017.474s">So</a>  starting at this we thought as a team with Maurice and Peter. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2021.376s">what</a>  is it that we can provide the committee so that they know here are the things that have already been done over the last 10 years in the physical building so that we can at least prioritize what needs to be done either if we renovate or if we come in with a wrecking ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2034.303s">If</a>  you go to the next slide, what we did was we tried to put things into kind of seven categories that if we are able to sit at the table with the stakeholders, we can say, we're gonna first of all, provide you information. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2045.649s">So</a>  committee members on this committee will see what are the things that have been done? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2050.091s">Where</a>  do we really need to put our work? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2051.572s">Where</a>  do we need to start? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2052.513s">Is</a>  it bathrooms? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2053.354s">Is</a>  it roof? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2054.095s">Is</a>  it plumbing? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2056.777s">If</a>  we provide the committee with all the information, which would include the enrollment of our school, you know, Medford High had 4,000 students years ago, and now there's 1,300. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2066.044s">So</a>  it's a lot different. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2066.785s">So</a>  when we think of a new building, we're not designing a school for 4,000 students anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2072.182s">So</a>  what we did was we hoped that providing some process for this would help people on the committee really understand and really do the difficult work of deciding what a school might look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2083.753s">I</a>  don't know if Maurice, if you wanna jump in or.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2085.474s">May</a>  I have a point of privilege? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2090.399s">Member</a>  McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2092.048s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2092.588s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Collin. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2093.709s">I</a>  guess I want to say from, you know, as a community member and people that I've been talking with in the community regarding the vision committee, I think, you know, the physical structure is one aspect of the vision committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2105.435s">I</a>  don't think it's the sole aspect from my perspective, which is a large reason why we were talking about making sure also that the vision committee was a diverse representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2115.14s">I</a>  think we need to hear from the vision committee about what <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2118.982s">It</a>  is they see from all aspects of the vision of the high school, and what needs to happen for the future of the high school, not just the physical structure, frankly, I think it is a combination of, you know, a variety of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2134.0s">For</a>  example, the, you know, I think the <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2138.873s">the</a>  anti-racism task force, some of the curriculum things that we've been talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2142.178s">I</a>  mean, I think that there's a whole ball of wax that we're talking, the social, emotional, and the physical, and potentially the academic. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2150.168s">And</a>  I think that this, you know, breaking down of it is great, but I wouldn't limit it to just the physical structure.</p>

    <p>[Fallon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2156.682s">So</a>  luckily we didn't then. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2158.544s">So</a>  I'm glad you said that Melanie, because that's why I was thanking member Ruseau for kind of clarifying it to me and maybe to other members. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2165.189s">But</a>  what we did is we were thinking more in general that yes, this would be, we know that the intent was heavy on building the plant itself, but there's other things that go into that, that when we think about what a building would look like in five years, there's a lot of layers. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2180.221s">So</a>  we actually did that.</p>

    <p>[Paul D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2182.613s">And</a>  also just to piggyback, there's so many stakeholders that are involved in regarding this, not just the vision committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2192.656s">It's</a>  you as a school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2194.177s">It's</a>  our site council here at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2196.878s">There's</a>  a lot of pieces that are involved here. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2199.258s">So</a>  what I'm trying to hope to get out of this committee of the whole two is a structured plan or a structured function <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2207.361s">for</a>  that vision committee are as more of an advisory piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2213.085s">Are</a>  they doing fact finding for us? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2215.607s">And</a>  then we're taking it back to our site council and then we're reviewing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2219.509s">I</a>  mean, like I said, there's so many different groups and stakeholders. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2223.092s">I</a>  just wanna make sure that it's clear of what the challenges or what the outcomes will be regarding this committee.</p>

    <p>[Fallon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2243.265s">Mayor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2244.085s">Madam</a>  Mayor, Mr. Rousseau has a question.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2246.666s">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2246.906s">I</a>  didn't see him. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2248.007s">Member</a>  Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2249.507s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2250.348s">Um,</a>  yeah, I'm just going through the approved policy on this advisory committees to the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2257.09s">So</a>  I mean, I just want to be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2259.031s">I</a>  have no intention or interest in providing what the vision is. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2263.272s">That</a>  was sort of the point is the community will decide what the vision is. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2268.274s">The</a>  community comes together and says, <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2270.645s">knock</a>  it all down and put a bunch of trailers in. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2272.686s">That's</a>  what Medford really wants, which I can't imagine, but let's pretend. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2277.868s">Then</a>  that's what the community wants. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2280.289s">I'm</a>  on for two year terms, just like everybody else here. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2283.871s">This</a>  vision needs to be something that the community has agreed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2287.392s">I</a>  mean, certainly the spark was about physical plants. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2294.789s">I</a>  completely agree with Member McLaughlin and Paul and Chad and everybody else who's spoken that that's, you know, the physical plant is, you know, a building is a lot more than the physical structure and how it integrates into the community and what do we include and what do we not include. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2311.664s">You</a>  know, MSBA, you can't build a pool with MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2314.967s">So,</a>  you know, those are really hard questions that we have to answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2317.49s">We</a>  can't <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2318.355s">build</a>  a building that is bigger than MSBA will allow us. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2322.017s">MSBA</a>  is the Massachusetts School Building Authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2324.438s">They</a>  fund school buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2327.379s">We</a>  can't actually build a building as big as that one that we have now. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2330.681s">So</a>  we would have really important and hard conversations around the Medford Family Network and preschool and all these other things that are in our physical plant now that absolutely there's no way that the new building <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2343.333s">could</a>  be funded through the normal structures and include those. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2346.935s">So</a>  those are really important things, but I think the community should decide that. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2350.737s">I</a>  mean, the school committee, obviously we have a role here, but I don't have any interest in providing my vision because my vision is pretty much straightforward and simple, knock the whole thing down, pretend there's a limitless amount of money, call Mr. Bloomberg and he'll just write us a couple billion dollar check and we'll be all happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2368.025s">Unfortunately,</a>  that's not reality, but, <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2372.251s">But</a>  that's why I think that, first of all, it does need to have a lot of people on it, and I don't know how many. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2379.293s">I</a>  want to also be clear that I firmly and very strongly believe it cannot be majority employees of the city or of the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2386.875s">It</a>  must be majority, not us, because this is not <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2392.74s">the</a>  principal's vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2396.042s">This</a>  is not the school committee's vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2397.704s">This</a>  needs to be the city of Medford's vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2400.125s">Because</a>  if we end up with a vision where the only thing they come back and say is, we've got three options. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2406.69s">They</a>  all involve knocking the building down and doing an override or whatever that thing is called when you get a loan like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2414.536s">They're</a>  the ones who are gonna have to sell it to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2416.717s">I</a>  mean, they have to vote for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2419.755s">You</a>  know, we're seven votes or however many of us live in Medford, we can't accomplish that. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2425.899s">So</a>  the community needs to be 100% behind whatever the heck that vision is, because they're going to have to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2433.284s">Actually,</a>  no matter what the options are, they're going to have to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2435.846s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2436.926s">So</a>  I was wondering if we'd be able to continue with the slide deck, just so that we can really show those pieces that we're talking about that I think would help frame the work.</p>

    <p>[Fallon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2446.45s">And</a>  I just want to say, I agree that it has to be a shared vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2449.132s">We</a>  were just thinking, we're going to have to do a lot of the, we want to provide this committee with all the information they need so that they can make these decisions, so that they can begin to have these conversations, because a lot of people don't know about the things that we've been doing within the building, because as far as we know, we're stuck with this building.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2465.18s">Point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2465.781s">Point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2467.342s">Point</a>  of information, member Rousseau, then Mr. DeLeva. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2470.243s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2471.044s">Part</a>  of the policy, I just wanted to provide this, I realize not everybody's necessarily read the policy, but <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2475.87s">Part</a>  of this is that the, when you say the committee, Mr. Fallon, I just wanna be clear, the committee being the advisory committee, we have to give the advisory committee a certain set of authority to request reports from you and whomever else, buildings and grounds, and not have us be in the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2493.604s">We</a>  can't be in the middle of every time the advisory committee says, <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2498.412s">well,</a>  what's our heating bill? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2499.733s">It</a>  can't come to school committee and get on the agenda, because this will be a 10 year project. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2503.437s">So</a>  I agree with you completely. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2505.299s">I</a>  just, when you said the committee, it's the advisory committee, not us. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2509.122s">I</a>  mean, that should be making these requests and getting what they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2513.006s">Sorry,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Fallon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2515.508s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Paul D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2516.99s">I</a>  actually had a question for a member of Vanderkloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2520.572s">Yes,</a>  she has extensive knowledge when new schools came into play. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2525.695s">I</a>  happen to be teaching at the old Hobbes. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2529.356s">At</a>  the time, and the transition happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2532.298s">So</a>  she actually has some knowledge based off when we transferred into our new schools newer schools at the time so. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2542.943s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2543.123s">Van</a>  der Kloot, what I was wondering is, while I was a new teacher at that time, the process, though, had committees, if I'm correct on that?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2551.429s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2553.225s">So</a>  we had the building the future committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2555.526s">And</a>  I would say that it came somewhat similar in that there was a great deal of discussion amongst in the community about the shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2567.894s">And</a>  then several school committee members, including myself spearheaded, bringing it to the floor for discussion and, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2577.28s">moving</a>  it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2579.361s">One</a>  of the things which helped us was we had dynamic leadership of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2584.223s">Rick</a>  Orlando and Tricia McDonough really did such an incredibly fabulous job outlining the path. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2592.867s">The</a>  first discussions were, there was a series of events around the community, listening events, getting people's input. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2602.791s">What</a>  were they thinking? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2603.651s">What</a>  were they seeing? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2604.551s">What</a>  were their reactions? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2607.012s">and</a>  their concerns as we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2610.055s">And</a>  remember, at that point, there was no, you know, in a similar way, we had not preconceived that we were going to build four new schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2619.262s">We</a>  didn't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2620.503s">All</a>  of that came into being over the course of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2626.387s">of</a>  the committee looking at the various different resources, concerns, land parcels availability, but even would they be K to H, would they be, none of that was preconceived. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2641.359s">That</a>  was all part of the work of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2645.122s">And</a>  that was then defined. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2648.064s">One</a>  of the things that was extremely important was there were different phases of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2653.008s">So</a>  the first was kind of the outreach <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2656.271s">Then</a>  the second was taking the information and coming up with some decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2661.215s">And</a>  those ones then were brought to the school committee for our input, because if we weren't buying it, there was no way we were going to be able to sell it to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2673.908s">And</a>  then a variety of different meetings happened around <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2678.812s">uh</a>  Medford uh you know outreaching to different groups and whatnot explaining what was um uh <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2686.599s">what</a>  project proposals there were, what ideas there were, and narrowing it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2691.683s">So</a>  it's really quite a process in the same way that I think that we're thinking here. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2697.568s">Were</a>  there discussions about educational? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2701.511s">Yes,</a>  absolutely, and they need to be included as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2705.435s">One</a>  of the things though that is very interesting sort of looking back is that there will be people who say, I just don't understand why. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2716.493s">And</a>  they really have no understanding today why certain decisions were made back then about either the placement of the schools or why there's a K to eight and a middle school on one piece of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2732.383s">So</a>  that's one of the interesting things as time goes on, those pieces are lost to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2737.787s">And</a>  then we have people saying, I don't understand this. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2741.069s">And</a>  I can tell you that all of those decisions were thoroughly vetted <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2746.605s">and</a>  that there was a basis for each one of those decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2750.566s">But</a>  over time, it does get lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2752.806s">And</a>  that's a valuable thing for me to realize as we go forward with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2758.567s">I</a>  do wanna mention, by the way, that there was at the time, the third stage of building the future committee, which is what we called it. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2770.369s">The</a>  third stage was the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2773.77s">And</a>  there was some work <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2775.49s">you</a>  know, things done over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2777.571s">And</a>  then at some point, Dr. Perrella, you may recall, the former headmaster of the high school, he put together a, he wanted to put together a grant and he looked very much at the library area and discussed a lot about what should be happening educationally in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2799.897s">And</a>  I thought it was a very thorough vetting. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2801.897s">There</a>  was a, at the time, <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2804.385s">There</a>  was a, they put together a presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2807.969s">And</a>  that's something that you know as we're talking about the things we're talking about not just the physical structure but how is the building going to be used educationally, we should, even though of course I'm sure it needs to be updated but we should look back to that, what happened at that point to. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2824.638s">The,</a>  it was a very dedicated group of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2831.043s">They</a>  had to be able to meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2833.806s">I</a>  think at first we were meeting weekly. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2837.869s">We</a>  could check with Rick Orlando and Tricia about exactly that, but it was a long process. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2844.454s">I</a>  would say that it was probably about a year before we came <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2849.338s">was</a>  the first presentation and the first narrowing down steps was, you know, it was a significant process of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2860.487s">I</a>  don't know if that answers the question.</p>

    <p>[Paul D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2862.749s">No,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2864.01s">I</a>  think you hold a valuable experience regarding this based off of the newer schools that were built at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2874.137s">And</a>  like you said, you have an idea of the process and who was involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2878.901s">And</a>  it was mostly community members, as member Ruseau was saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2884.846s">If</a>  I remember correctly, there were a couple of administrators, but they were just overseeing because they had knowledge base that community members probably couldn't grab right at the time.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2894.889s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2895.369s">We</a>  certainly had a few staff, but there were also people who acted. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2899.891s">They</a>  might have attended the meetings because they were giving information. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2903.432s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2905.312s">You</a>  know, so it depended, but I think we were we really started at ground zero without great <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2914.69s">you</a>  know, with no preconceptions about what was going to happen.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2920.652s">There's</a>  a blank slate.</p>

    <p>[Paul D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2922.573s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2923.614s">The</a>  six o'clock subcommittee meeting was canceled. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2925.795s">Is</a>  that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2927.595s">Or</a>  are we on a hard hour tonight? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2931.117s">I</a>  didn't know that.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2934.098s">Which</a>  was the six o'clock subcommittee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2936.619s">Oh,</a>  I'm not sure.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2937.119s">I</a>  just know this said five to six, so I just want to</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2941.378s">I</a>  don't think there was a six o'clock subcommittee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2943.44s">I</a>  think we're not on a higher.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2944.721s">I</a>  think six was tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2946.122s">Six</a>  is tomorrow, okay.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2947.282s">Which</a>  is canceled. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2948.103s">The</a>  subcommittee meeting for tomorrow has been canceled. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2950.685s">It</a>  was five to 6.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2951.946s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2953.047s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2956.649s">I</a>  think we need to probably create a plan for how we're gonna get, when and how we're gonna advertise and make sure we have a way to get it out to the entire community <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2971.343s">to</a>  make sure that we're getting applications and new applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2974.304s">And</a>  so I think sometime after the new year is probably best to do that and maybe use most of what the last application said and maybe add a few questions to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2986.226s">I</a>  think maybe we start there and then I think we're on the right track after we get that out and spend plenty of time advertising that, then we come up with a charge.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3000.028s">Sorry.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3001.003s">Member</a>  Ruseau did start that, but I think that's something we need to have a whole nother meeting on to create a formal charge that we will give the vision committee once it is fully established. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3014.967s">And</a>  then I think at that point, I think the vision committee is gonna probably need subcommittees and one of those will be outreach and strategy communication to be able to grab, whether that's a survey or <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3028.208s">or</a>  what we need to make sure we're reaching out to the whole community to give ideas and suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3032.652s">So</a>  that's just what, just wanted to figure out a way how to stop the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3038.076s">And</a>  I think probably by the end of January, we should maybe have this application out and come up with a plan on how to get it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3046.022s">And</a>  member Ruseau, then member Graham, then member McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3050.065s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3050.646s">I</a>  just wanna be quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3053.067s">That</a>  is, I don't, <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3053.97s">That</a>  is certainly a way to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3055.291s">And</a>  I don't think it's a terrible way, but I would say that by providing what that statement is first, I know if I was looking to volunteer, I'd wanna know what am I volunteering for? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3066.599s">And</a>  I think if I was being told I was volunteering to participate in a vision, figuring out what our high school would look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3074.365s">And</a>  all I cared about as a community member was how to make sure we actually even have a planet a century from now. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3080.892s">And</a>  if you told me that the vision included that we will only consider options, and again, I put that on there, that we only are considering carbon neutral or better options, that would excite me as somebody who was like, all right, I can participate in this because I know that's what I'm going to be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3096.725s">If</a>  you ask me to be involved and you don't tell me what it is exactly, well, I mean, there's just a lot of other things, especially for volunteers to participate in. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3107.791s">And</a>  I think that if we, for instance, ended up with a statement that says it needs to be carbon neutral and we don't end up with anybody who has, you know, has a education in that background or does that for a living, then it's going to be just endless, like finding consultants. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3122.658s">And</a>  my opinion is this and Google searches when we could really make that much quicker if there's an environmental engineer, whatever the proper titles are. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3132.303s">So,</a>  I mean, my preference is definitely to put that forward first so that those people who are volunteering <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3137.262s">can</a>  say, oh, I do care about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3142.225s">That's</a>  just my preference. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3143.386s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3143.687s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3144.367s">Member</a>  Graham, then Member McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3152.973s">Sorry</a>  about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3155.555s">It's</a>  been a long day of Zooming. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3156.836s">So</a>  I was also thinking about some of the things that I heard in the original, in the last process, where I heard people say things like, <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3167.612s">I</a>  wasn't sure what the time commitment was. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3170.915s">So</a>  I didn't sign up. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3173.697s">And</a>  then I also heard people who were selected who were like, I still don't know what I signed up for. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3178.521s">And</a>  like, I may or may not be able to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3180.863s">So</a>  I think it is important for us to like come up with that, that sort of charge, as well as some, some sort of rough sketch of how <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3194.393s">we</a>  think the committee needs to be comprised and where is the balance of like, <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3200.752s">the</a>  person who really wants to be involved but cannot come to a meeting every single week, maybe there's a role for them versus the person who has a background in environmental science building schools and like what we would want from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3213.34s">So</a>  I do think even if it means our application doesn't go out until the end of February, honestly, I think it's worth our investment to like take the time to sort of spec that out, this group and really <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3228.073s">be</a>  on the same page about what we're asking the group to do, how we envision that the group will operate, because I think it needs to be bigger than it was, but as soon as you get bigger than it was, you have to have some substructures in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3244.222s">And</a>  maybe we can have some of that discussion to sort of provide that guidance and then send out the application so that there really is like a place for everybody to <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3257.151s">feel</a>  like there's a home for them to participate without having to blindly say, yes, I have an unlimited number of hours to give to Medford public schools so I think I'd rather us take the time in January and even if it goes into February to get that part. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3272.959s">right</a>  and like sort of like staked out in some fashion so that when we send the application out we can both be clear about what what we're asking the larger committee to do and also maybe there are sub jobs that we're trying to find people to fill but also that we can have a clear message at that time about <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3296.115s">that</a>  we are committed to having more voices than just the people on the committee and this is how we will do it and there, you know, I think we found in the reopening task force there were a good number of people uniquely interested in the communications piece of what needed to happen and they were, it was a great group so <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3312.82s">um</a>  you know maybe there's a way for us to make sure that we are being clear about all the like various things that we think we need before that application goes out the door and I think honestly like we're probably not going to be in a position to be like lots of on-site activity in large groups between now and then anyway so I think we just maybe use the time to to do that right up front. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3336.496s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3336.897s">Member</a>  McLaughlin then Member Van der Kloot.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3340.808s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3341.428s">I</a>  would agree that we need to be very specific in the charge around what it is we're asking the community to be part of and to be, you know, really take the time to spell that out, which, you know, I don't think anyone's proposing that that happened tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3354.616s">But</a>  I do think that, again, that's something we should do with what the hourly requirement is, and maybe some of the specific roles that we're hoping to fill. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3364.221s">And,</a>  you know, some of these those other things that we can work around. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3367.623s">I</a>  also think that <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3369.182s">we</a>  really need to be thinking, obviously, I'm sure you are thinking of this, Mayor, is translation for all of this material, applications, and anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3378.306s">But</a>  I also think that we need to, as we consider the BIPOC community, I really think that as we're even structuring what we want the MHS, technical high school vision committee to look like, that we need to be able to engage some stakeholders in our community <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3398.983s">that</a>  represent the BIPOC community to say, are we really thinking about everybody even in this statement and even in how we're rolling this out so that perhaps as we're structuring this statement, we could be thinking about who are some leaders in a variety of different constituencies so that, again, much like what's been happening in subcommittee meetings, we are going to some <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3423.545s">you</a>  know, experts in those areas to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3426.547s">So</a>  I would also just suggest that as we're even creating the mission for the vision committee and the structure for the statements before the applications go out, that we have some identified community stakeholders that really can help fulfill the role of the BIPOC community that we're not representing here, please.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3449.244s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3450.045s">Member</a>  Wierdekloot?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3456.258s">One</a>  of the things I just wanted to mention was the importance of also having <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3464.44s">members</a>  go out and even if just in the initial process we did visitations to other school districts and that was so important and that's really harder to do right now because of COVID but you know most of us are framed you know we know our high school maybe we've been in another one but we certainly you know haven't been in a lot and we we went to quite a few other districts and that was <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3491.793s">very</a>  instrumental and that required that people were also available to take some time during the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3501.704s">And</a>  that was important because it excited us incredibly to see, to come out of our world and also to see what was being offered <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3513.125s">in</a>  other districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3514.025s">And</a>  so I just want to mention that, that maybe it can be conveyed somewhat by people visiting and then doing presentations. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3523.009s">They</a>  can be, you know, that might be a job, if you would, that some people go, a smaller amount go and then make a presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3531.271s">But</a>  that's just another aspect we want to make sure we're doing is visitations.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3536.933s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3537.334s">Divya?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3537.634s">Let</a>  me just try to unmute you. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3544.63s">work.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3545.751s">Yeah,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3546.512s">Um,</a>  I just wanted to add one more thing that I think was mentioned by a few folks here, which is, you know, who is, who are the people who are most impacted by the social and physical spaces in the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3561.144s">and</a>  most impacted negatively. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3563.026s">And</a>  to my mind, it would be students who have disabilities, students who identify as transgender in terms of their access to bathrooms, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3573.357s">So</a>  factoring in their input would need to be intentional. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3579.123s">And</a>  also volunteering to these places is also a privilege. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3585.797s">and</a>  recognizing that and doing targeted and intentional outreach because equity is not giving equal opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3593.18s">It's</a>  not about doing lotteries or else we will end up with another committee, which is all white, like what happened the last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3601.423s">So</a>  I just want to front and center that, that the people who are most impacted and that would include students as well, I would hope to be part of the vision committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3611.306s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3612.386s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3613.447s">Member</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3615.267s">Thank</a>  you, Divya, for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3616.948s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3617.688s">And</a>  so I just want to clarify around, you know, for folks that are watching as well, when Dr. Anand, when you're saying that it's a privilege, I'm hearing that you're saying that it's a privilege that people who maybe aren't working or have more flexible work hours or time, you know, or someone to take care of their children, that they're able to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3640.554s">Is</a>  that what you're saying when you say a privilege? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3646.275s">Oh,</a>  you're still muted, Dr. Anand, sorry.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3651.699s">Yes,</a>  and if I'm, that too, and if I'm a parent who is, you know, of a child with a disability living in Medford housing, for example, and I'm working three jobs, my voice is very important to have, but at the same time, I do not have the time to devote and sit into a vision committee where, you know, on the one hand I might be a minority, <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3673.242s">And</a>  so I have the labor of educating everyone else in the room, plus, you know, have the luxury of time to devote to that space. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3682.866s">So</a>  being mindful of these, you know, would be really helpful if we actually want to, you know, move into action in terms of equity.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3691.63s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3692.21s">So</a>  I think we really have some work to do as a school committee around what that would look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3696.592s">And</a>  I'd love to talk with you more about that if we could at some point.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3699.693s">Yeah,</a>  sure, Melanie. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3701.354s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3704.718s">So</a>  it sounds like we wanna do the charge first. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3707.699s">I</a>  think that's the majority of this school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3713.9s">I</a>  don't know if we wanna see more of that slideshow, if we want that email to us and we set up a meeting for early January to try to come up with a charge together. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3726.042s">Thoughts?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3729.323s">Member</a>  Ruseau, then member Graham.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3732.004s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3733.124s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3734.245s">You</a>  know, unfortunately, open meeting law is, this is an example of where open meeting law is truly a bit of a pain. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3741.586s">You</a>  know, ideally we'd all have a Google doc open and we'd do a bunch of editing and we'd all come up with something we liked as a first draft and we'd come to the meeting and we could talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3752.348s">And</a>  that would be against the law, so we can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3756.109s">So,</a>  you know, how to accomplish drafting language as a committee, <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3763.482s">It's,</a>  it's awful. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3764.843s">I</a>  mean, so, you know, I think that you know that that is part of why I had drafted something because I couldn't envision how to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3778.454s">But</a>  I think that if <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3780.09s">know,</a>  if the superintendent reaches out to individual members, the sort of the weird exception here is the superintendent's not an elected official, she can reach out to all of us and try to understand what each of us wants and in a vision, in a <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3796.378s">in</a>  a charge statement and try to come up with something she thinks will work for all of us, as long as she's not like, well, Paul said this and Nia said that, you know, that wouldn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3806.56s">And</a>  I personally feel like she could definitely do this work if she's okay with it or wants to assign it to someone. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3813.321s">And</a>  that would be my preference, because honestly, if we just try to do it in a meeting like this on Zoom, I just feel like we're gonna have seven more meetings.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3823.703s">Yeah,</a>  I think that sounds like a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3826.447s">I</a>  know myself and my staff worked on a charge for the fire station task force. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3831.35s">So</a>  that's an example. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3832.431s">And</a>  plus Paul, you did start something that we can go off of. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3836.713s">And</a>  if we just all send our ideas to Dr. Edouard-Vincent and the team, maybe we can try to draft some sort of charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3844.998s">And</a>  I know that some of the slideshow may acknowledge some of what we want in the charge anyway, and we can sit and review it in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3855.114s">Member</a>  Graham, sorry.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3857.555s">I</a>  was actually gonna suggest that we not put that on the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3861.717s">She</a>  has lots of things to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3865.378s">But,</a>  and you know, we've talked extensively about like how many things we're asking the superintendent to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3871.581s">And</a>  I think this is an example of something that as a committee, we could say, you know, there's like, I don't know, there's three or four pieces of this and could individual committee members take a shot at it <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3882.182s">and</a>  bring something to the next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3883.823s">I</a>  think that's a really fair way to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3887.224s">As</a>  long as the committee agrees with that approach, I don't see why we can't each individual, you know, take a part and write something down. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3896.868s">So</a>  there's something to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3898.028s">I,</a>  you know, I think it would be luxurious for Maurice to have the time to have a half hour conversation with each of us about our wants and our needs, but you know, we, <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3909.731s">she</a>  has really pressing things to do as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3912.533s">So</a>  I would be happy to take on a piece of the work, but I want to make sure that the entire committee is on board with who's going to do what and that it's just simply a draft and a starting point so we can have a productive conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3927.725s">So</a>  that's just another idea.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3929.926s">I</a>  just assumed that <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3931.271s">Dr.</a>  Edouard-Vincent would kind of delegate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3933.612s">I</a>  know Mr. Fallon, Mr. DeLava have done a lot to prepare for tonight, Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3939.253s">So</a>  it's up to the committee, Dr. Vincent, it's up to your feelings as well.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3946.655s">Just</a>  listening to what was said, I was also thinking about the possibility of <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3952.788s">Sending</a>  some of the charge language to the subcommittee building and ground subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3957.674s">And</a>  I was thinking, maybe we could carve out a chunk of time at a pre existing meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3964.483s">If</a>  that's a possibility of the top of my head right now I can't remember everyone who's on that committee and. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3971.852s">I</a>  don't mind the coordination in working with the principals, working with Susie to at least begin to move the work forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3981.735s">And</a>  the second slide deck was kind of trying to capture ideas of how it could possibly look, which is a draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3991.397s">So</a>  I can definitely send that to everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3994.81s">And</a>  if we were able to bring it to subcommittee, I don't have the calendar in front of me right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4001.552s">If</a>  a team member might be able to look at the date. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4005.173s">So</a>  when we have like our next building and ground subcommittee, if that was one way, or it could go to one of the other subcommittees so that we could <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4014.615s">Divvy</a>  up the work so that not any one member was you know burdened with carrying a heavier load than others. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4023.701s">So</a>  some of it could be under communications subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4027.304s">We</a>  could bring a portion of that under communications. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4030.586s">A</a>  portion could also be under building and ground subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4034.989s">Divide</a>  up the work and through subcommittee you would have at least <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4038.932s">three</a>  members working together so you would have like three voices contributing to you know one chunk of it and then I could work on the coordination piece of you know the different meetings and you know bringing it together to say this you know this is a potential draft and present it at a regular meeting that's just another another way to give people an opportunity to <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4067.586s">work</a>  in a team without violating open meeting law, or work collaboratively as opposed to doing the giant Google Doc. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4078.436s">Member</a>  Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4078.976s">I</a>  feel like we have a lot of options. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4084.099s">Um,</a>  and, um, I guess, you know, for me, it's like the, the strategy group, it seems really relevant. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4091.185s">Uh,</a>  the equity group that, you know, the equity subcommittee that I have seems relevant, the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4097.11s">I</a>  feel like they all end up having a piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4099.772s">And,</a>  and, um, I think a really good charge statement can't be four pages long. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4106.938s">Uh,</a>  you know, when we ask for applicants, one page is good. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4111.58s">And</a>  that's going to include everything you're going to fill in. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4113.982s">So</a>  I mean, anything more than a paragraph is probably too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4117.885s">And</a>  I mean, I don't have any evidence that that's the right amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4121.787s">But</a>  so I just feel that if we send it off to the various subcommittees, <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4128.607s">they're</a>  either gonna all add their spin, you know, the strategy group is gonna think all about strategy, buildings and grounds are gonna think all about physical plant, the equity, the subcommittee that I have will add several sentences about the importance of equity and understanding how we get different people in the community involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4147.513s">And</a>  then this charge statement will be so long that people won't even apply because they won't have time to finish reading what it is we're gonna ask them to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4157.056s">I</a>  mean, so I just, I feel strongly like it needs, I mean, I feel strongly it needs to be as short as possible and as, I don't want to say vague, that's not really the right word, but not as non-prescriptive as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4171.666s">And,</a>  you know, sending it to subcommittee means the subcommittee will have to meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4176.369s">And</a>  just like the full committee, not even two of those members of the subcommittee can open a Google Doc and work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4182.494s">They</a>  have to, maybe the chair does it before the meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4186.475s">and</a>  then they can talk about it in the meeting, because the open meeting law does apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4190.677s">I</a>  hate that, but I did ask Howard about that last year, because I was very confused how we could work as a subcommittee with open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4198.419s">So</a>  I just feel like it'll just make it so that the subcommittee will meet, then they will have to send it to the full committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4206.613s">And</a>  then we will all have something to say, and then it will go either back to the subcommittee, to a different subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4212.478s">I</a>  just think we'll be in March before we even come close to a statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4217.922s">So</a>  that's just my opinion on sending it off to a subcommittee.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4225.188s">So</a>  Mr. DeLeva.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4227.35s">Sorry.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4231.815s">Sorry,</a>  I forgot to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4232.675s">I</a>  think we're all just zoomed out here for a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4235.737s">So</a>  what I'm hearing from member Ruseau, which no different than what we're doing at the high school is I think it's more of you coming up with a mission for this particular group. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4246.301s">What</a>  is the mission statement for this group? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4249.943s">Then</a>  they can come together and do like the vision stuff, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4253.545s">Am</a>  I understanding that?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4257.566s">If</a>  I might, mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4259.456s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, the policy statement, our policy says that the assignment the school committee wishes the committee to fulfill and the extent and limitations of its responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4269.303s">So</a>  yeah, I mean, that's why I think that it's probably not actually as hard as we're thinking it will be, because, you know, we will probably have to debate things like, you know, Paul's all about this, whatever the options are have to be carbon neutral. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4282.694s">And</a>  if everybody else, if not a majority of us agree, then that comes out. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4286.897s">But,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4288.723s">you</a>  know, things like keep it under $150 million, like those aren't gonna be in the vision statement probably because that's really just so perspective.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4297.869s">Mr.</a>  Delivery, you're all set. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4301.471s">Dr.</a>  Edward-Vincent and member Van der Kloot.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4304.353s">Yes,</a>  so what I was gonna say in regards to having it <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4310.347s">go</a>  and have the respective groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4312.728s">I</a>  truly am. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4313.648s">Member</a>  Ruseau, where you have a draft charge already written, I am willing to be the keeper of the knowledge and send it to everyone and take feedback and revisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4330.896s">I'm</a>  willing to do that so that I will be able to work on it, share it with the team, and see if all of those pieces can kind of come together <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4340.58s">into</a>  one inclusive charge statement and keep in mind that the charge should not be longer than one page. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4350.685s">So</a>  I'm definitely willing to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4354.206s">I'm</a>  willing to do that piece of the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4357.028s">And</a>  then once we are able to come up with an official charge, the next phase of the work would be to include that charge <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4368.313s">you</a>  know, on the application process, but also to include what the specific subgroupings could be so that as people try to determine whether they're interested in terms of the time commitment in those pieces. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4382.545s">So</a>  I am willing to do phase one of keeping that charge and trying to at least get the charge done and be able to present it back to you as a committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4398.394s">And</a>  hopefully, by the end of January, everyone will have been able to have weighed in so that we'll be able to move on to the next phase at that point in time.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4415.904s">I</a>  want to ask member Rousseau to read what he had read at the beginning, his charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4422.649s">Paul,</a>  can you just repeat it?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4423.81s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4427.533s">And</a>  I'll paste it into the chat. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4428.914s">Is</a>  chat open? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4429.675s">It</a>  is. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4429.935s">Let</a>  me just paste it in first so I can find the text. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4437.329s">The</a>  Medford High School Vision Advisory Committee shall work to understand and state clearly the possible options to provide Medford with a high school that can suit our educational and other needs for the next 50 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4448.134s">The</a>  options may only include those that will be carbon neutral or better. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4452.076s">The</a>  advisory committee shall provide quarterly reports to the school committee with a presentation at the conclusion of the service. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4458.64s">And</a>  it's worth noting that there are six sections that we have to fill in. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4464.122s">One</a>  of them is, <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4466.124s">The</a>  first one is like, how long are we asking them? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4469.145s">And</a>  my suggestion was we just say a year with a possibility of an extension of six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4474.386s">And</a>  then section C asks for the resources that we shall provide to the advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4482.229s">And</a>  in my suggestion, I said the superintendent shall provide reports as requested by a majority vote of the advisory committee, unless the superintendent believes the report request is burdensome. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4494.272s">Should</a>  a report request be considered burdensome the advisory committee may request that the request may request that the request be placed on the next school committee agenda for discussion and consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4505.851s">resource</a>  request shall be considered on a case by case basis and made to the school committee at the next scheduled meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4511.374s">So</a>  in that I was envisioning, you know, if the advisory committee once fully constituted recognizes that, you know, we need, we really, let's pretend they need to have a site survey done by a company that'll cost $20,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4528.072s">and</a>  that they, without that, they don't feel they can move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4530.594s">I'm</a>  just making that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4533.395s">They</a>  would obviously have to come to us and say, we need this, can you pay for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4539.899s">And</a>  then there was a section E, which was about, section E is one of the most weird sentences. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4547.144s">I</a>  won't read the whole thing, cause it's quite long, but I essentially think what it's trying to say is, <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4552.487s">you</a>  know, it's around conflicts of interest and making sure that we don't just have a vision committee consisting of all of the staff of the buildings and grounds department, or, you know, that wouldn't be a conflict of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4566.656s">And</a>  the last one is section F, which is responsibility for release of information to the press. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4572.899s">And</a>  my suggestion was the chair of the advisory committee shall be responsible for press contact just so that <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4582.598s">you</a>  know, with any kind of a committee, everybody will not agree all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4589.507s">And</a>  to keep things nice, it would make sense if one person is the press contact. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4595.676s">So</a>  that's what I had.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4597.186s">Thank</a>  you, Paul, you know personally I think that's a fine starting point to be able to I mean, to take what Paul has has written and for us that to deliberate on it to give feedback to the superintendent and, and, you know, for us to <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4617.05s">you</a>  know, then if she could develop some way to share that with us, and then I think that would make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4625.134s">And</a>  while I can understand Jenny's concern about not Maurice having too much, I think it's absolutely critical that Maurice does play a strong role in this development. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4637.12s">So</a>  I think that works. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4640.401s">You</a>  know, I like Paul's starting point. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4642.662s">personally.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4643.202s">I</a>  think it's a good place to begin with, it's solid, but yet there's also a lot of potentials for discussion as well.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4654.506s">Okay,</a>  so is there a motion on the floor that will use Paul's starter draft as a way to, you know, take a few weeks and review and send potential additions, edits to superintendent and our staff, <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4672.232s">to</a>  then compile a charge that we will review by the end of January. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4681.416s">We</a>  don't even have to put a timeframe. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4682.497s">I</a>  know- So moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4684.298s">20</a>  other Committee of the Whole meetings, but sometime after the new year. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4688.279s">So</a>  moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4689.82s">Moved</a>  by member Van der Kloot, seconded by- Second. <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4694.482s">Member</a>  Ruseau, roll call.</p>
