1
00:00:44,182 --> 00:00:45,203
[SPEAKER_01]: We should have it, Brianna.

2
00:00:47,224 --> 00:00:48,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much, thank you.

3
00:00:49,025 --> 00:00:54,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, it is 4-5, the Medford School Committee, Committee of the Whole meeting.

4
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:57,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Meeting date is 3-9-2022.

5
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:04,355
[SPEAKER_05]: There'll be a Committee of the Whole meeting on Wednesday, the 9th, 2022 from four to 6 p.m., held remotely on Zoom.

6
00:01:05,075 --> 00:01:10,959
[SPEAKER_05]: The purpose of the meeting is to discuss, edit, and approve the draft of the school committee rules packet proposed by member Rousseau.

7
00:01:12,147 --> 00:01:16,690
[SPEAKER_05]: You can zoom in or you can call in using number 929-205-6099.

8
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:25,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Please enter meeting ID 930-1644-8588 when prompted.

9
00:01:26,935 --> 00:01:32,879
[SPEAKER_05]: The purpose of the meeting is to discuss, edit and approve the draft of the school committee rules document proposed by member Rousseau.

10
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:40,663
[SPEAKER_05]: If my memory is correct, we left off on page

11
00:01:42,933 --> 00:01:49,117
[SPEAKER_05]: 1112 that we were reviewing and asking questions about.

12
00:01:50,758 --> 00:01:54,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, member Cress has her hand up and then member Rousseau.

13
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:03,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Mayor, I checked in with Mr. Russo the other week and we stopped at number 67.

14
00:02:04,326 --> 00:02:07,427
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to go back because I think we moved too quickly in the first meeting.

15
00:02:07,467 --> 00:02:12,368
[SPEAKER_08]: I just have to bring something up about number 51 that I didn't get a chance to mention.

16
00:02:12,728 --> 00:02:19,869
[SPEAKER_08]: So I wanted to just kind of go back to just review number 51 again, because I had notes and I never got a chance.

17
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:22,490
[SPEAKER_08]: I noted that I didn't get a chance to mention anything on number 51.

18
00:02:24,217 --> 00:02:38,263
[SPEAKER_12]: And I also just point of information also in there, if we could put up the document so that folks watching or at home can see the document that we're referring to, that would be helpful if someone could put it up as a screen share, please.

19
00:02:39,844 --> 00:02:47,567
[SPEAKER_12]: And then that way, I'm not switching between windows because I'm working on a laptop with an elevated foot and makes it a little tricky.

20
00:02:47,587 --> 00:02:50,529
[SPEAKER_12]: So the screen share would be great.

21
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:53,570
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a hard copy, so I'm not sure if

22
00:02:54,852 --> 00:02:57,173
[SPEAKER_05]: school admin could screen share.

23
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:58,553
[SPEAKER_05]: And member Kreatz.

24
00:02:59,993 --> 00:03:00,634
[SPEAKER_14]: Peter, hold on.

25
00:03:01,294 --> 00:03:01,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

26
00:03:01,994 --> 00:03:04,715
[SPEAKER_05]: And member Kreatz, why don't you start off by going to.

27
00:03:04,735 --> 00:03:06,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of order.

28
00:03:07,696 --> 00:03:08,716
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't taken a roll call.

29
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:10,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call.

30
00:03:10,396 --> 00:03:13,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call has been requested by member Ruseau.

31
00:03:13,717 --> 00:03:14,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Please call the roll.

32
00:03:15,258 --> 00:03:16,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

33
00:03:16,178 --> 00:03:16,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham.

34
00:03:17,538 --> 00:03:17,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Here.

35
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:22,480
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm using my memory since I left a little thing at home.

36
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,880
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm sorry they're going to be out of order.

37
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:26,547
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

38
00:03:27,087 --> 00:03:27,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Hays?

39
00:03:28,668 --> 00:03:28,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Here.

40
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:30,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Member McLaughlin?

41
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:31,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Here.

42
00:03:32,371 --> 00:03:33,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Member Kreatz, you would have been ahead.

43
00:03:33,792 --> 00:03:35,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, here, here.

44
00:03:35,474 --> 00:03:36,614
[SPEAKER_07]: One, two, three, four.

45
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Mustone will be joining us later.

46
00:03:38,816 --> 00:03:42,219
[SPEAKER_07]: And wait, one, two, three, four.

47
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau?

48
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Five.

49
00:03:47,783 --> 00:03:49,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn, did I skip somebody?

50
00:03:49,805 --> 00:03:50,205
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

51
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:51,886
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's all of us.

52
00:03:52,347 --> 00:03:53,448
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm used to having it written down.

53
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:55,989
[SPEAKER_05]: I am here.

54
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:58,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, there's six in the affirmative, one absent.

55
00:03:58,711 --> 00:04:06,676
[SPEAKER_05]: So for now, we can move on to number 51, member Cressy, you had a question on that.

56
00:04:08,337 --> 00:04:16,022
[SPEAKER_08]: So I originally in the prior meeting, I had notes listed here that it says, you know, regular meetings will begin at 630.

57
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:16,603
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

58
00:04:17,243 --> 00:04:22,927
[SPEAKER_08]: We made that adjustment in the last meeting to correct it from another time that it had said no meetings at school

59
00:04:23,047 --> 00:04:24,068
[SPEAKER_08]: committee will go beyond.

60
00:04:24,628 --> 00:04:26,029
[SPEAKER_08]: It says 11 p.m.

61
00:04:26,049 --> 00:04:31,733
[SPEAKER_08]: I just have concerns about that for everybody who is in the school committee meetings.

62
00:04:32,174 --> 00:04:37,177
[SPEAKER_08]: The administrators, the students, the teachers, just everybody, the public watching.

63
00:04:37,197 --> 00:04:39,099
[SPEAKER_08]: I think 11 p.m.

64
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,880
[SPEAKER_08]: is just too late in the evening.

65
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,441
[SPEAKER_08]: We start at 6 30 p.m.

66
00:04:42,461 --> 00:04:51,207
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's more reasonable to have it go from like 6 30 to 9 30 and if there's a motion to recess

67
00:04:52,467 --> 00:05:00,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we should take a roll call, you know, is there a motion to recess, you know, and put everything on the table that we haven't covered, and then it gets put on the next meeting.

68
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,991
[SPEAKER_08]: So I, I have a motion to amend the time change from 11pm to 930pm.

69
00:05:10,473 --> 00:05:14,277
[SPEAKER_08]: And the chair will then ask you know as we're getting close to 930pm.

70
00:05:14,798 --> 00:05:20,424
[SPEAKER_08]: If there is a motion to recess or continue the meeting until an extended period of time is stated.

71
00:05:20,784 --> 00:05:25,529
[SPEAKER_08]: So for example, like the chair would say, is there a motion to recess the meeting if we're not done.

72
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:33,636
[SPEAKER_08]: If we're close to being done, then you could maybe say, is there a motion to recess the meeting until like 10 p.m., you know?

73
00:05:34,036 --> 00:05:35,797
[SPEAKER_08]: And we might get done before 10 p.m.

74
00:05:36,077 --> 00:05:40,521
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just think going from 6.30 to 11 p.m.

75
00:05:40,981 --> 00:05:46,345
[SPEAKER_08]: with everybody's busy days and lives and having to be at school the next morning or work very early.

76
00:05:46,365 --> 00:05:51,209
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I don't retain anything after 9 p.m.

77
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:52,250
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just gone.

78
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,932
[SPEAKER_09]: And- I second that member Kreatz.

79
00:05:55,672 --> 00:05:56,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you.

80
00:05:57,174 --> 00:05:59,576
[SPEAKER_05]: The 11 be moved to 930.

81
00:06:00,137 --> 00:06:00,377
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

82
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:13,850
[SPEAKER_12]: And by member McLaughlin, can I actually make a comment Mayor before we do the road, it would it be appropriate if I make it just a brief comment, or maybe we can hear from.

83
00:06:16,265 --> 00:06:17,825
[SPEAKER_12]: maybe we could hear from the superintendent.

84
00:06:17,865 --> 00:06:31,949
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I know that this has been a conversation that I've had with a few of the administrators and to that exact point, I know that with COVID, obviously we had really long hours and really long meetings and hopefully we don't have to repeat any of that again anytime soon.

85
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:40,892
[SPEAKER_12]: But even with 11 o'clock, getting up so early, I know from the administrator's perspective, I've heard the same, that it's been very difficult.

86
00:06:40,992 --> 00:06:41,552
[SPEAKER_12]: And I also,

87
00:06:42,552 --> 00:06:47,614
[SPEAKER_12]: definitely get really tired come 10 o'clock, especially if it's an intense meeting or there's a lot of material.

88
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:55,038
[SPEAKER_12]: So just wanted to ask if we might hear a weigh in from the administration if they're able, if that sounds reasonable for them hourly.

89
00:06:55,688 --> 00:07:14,852
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I definitely would say having the 930 end time is reasonable knowing that sometimes we have either executive sessions or we could have future subcommittee meetings or future committee of the whole meetings that are back to back to a regular meeting.

90
00:07:15,392 --> 00:07:20,813
[SPEAKER_00]: So we still potentially could be meeting from four or five until

91
00:07:22,634 --> 00:07:24,995
[SPEAKER_00]: 9.30 and then do a check-in at that point in time.

92
00:07:25,095 --> 00:07:27,937
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think 11 p.m.

93
00:07:28,337 --> 00:07:35,701
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's just, that's a little too much.

94
00:07:36,402 --> 00:07:41,645
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too long a day for us to be able to really function coherently.

95
00:07:43,746 --> 00:07:49,229
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would be in support of a 9.30 time to check in, knowing that we may start earlier.

96
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:53,870
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

97
00:07:55,212 --> 00:07:56,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Hays, then Member Ruseau.

98
00:07:59,956 --> 00:08:00,677
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

99
00:08:00,857 --> 00:08:03,780
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I certainly don't want to make anyone's days longer.

100
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:10,467
[SPEAKER_10]: My only concern is that, and I don't remember historically, even though I attended most of the meetings,

101
00:08:10,971 --> 00:08:24,703
[SPEAKER_10]: how if most of the meetings do go very long, but at some point, if we keep backloading meetings with the previous week's unfinished agenda items, we're not going to make it through all of our agenda items.

102
00:08:24,743 --> 00:08:31,088
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't, again, I think I've said this a lot, but I don't know where the balance is, but I'm a little concerned that if we cut it off too early,

103
00:08:32,017 --> 00:08:36,759
[SPEAKER_10]: that on those days where we have a lot of agenda items, they're just gonna keep getting pushed.

104
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:43,681
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought the purpose of this particular rule was really just to say, that's the outside time we will go to.

105
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:51,144
[SPEAKER_10]: Not that generally we expect our hope meetings to go that long, but that this would just be the very latest we would ever go.

106
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:54,705
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd be curious to hear what other people have to say.

107
00:08:54,885 --> 00:08:57,366
[SPEAKER_10]: I am concerned about pushing items off too much.

108
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, member Ruseau.

109
00:09:01,228 --> 00:09:01,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

110
00:09:02,222 --> 00:09:08,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, that is, uh, member Hays's interpretation was correct that this was, uh, sort of drawing a line in the sand.

111
00:09:08,203 --> 00:09:10,784
[SPEAKER_07]: We've gone past 11 o'clock on many occasions.

112
00:09:11,564 --> 00:09:27,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and I just thought it's important to remind us, the body, um, and anybody else watching that our meeting in February before the last one, I'm sorry, I don't have the date, had one item on the agenda, one item, and we went to 930.

113
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and that was a light

114
00:09:30,493 --> 00:09:33,937
[SPEAKER_07]: That was as light of an agenda as I think I can recall us ever having.

115
00:09:34,557 --> 00:09:37,621
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I guess I don't mind 930.

116
00:09:38,181 --> 00:09:51,115
[SPEAKER_07]: I would just like to know what is the body intending to do when there's six unfinished items on the agenda, when there's public that has come to speak on items on the agenda that aren't going to happen till 1030 which would be awful but has happened.

117
00:09:53,860 --> 00:10:09,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I mean, if this is going to be whatever our rules are, I mean, I, I, the language as it is, regardless of whether it's nine 30 or 11 is the meeting is over and that somebody stands up and makes a motion to say, let's just keep powering through it.

118
00:10:09,332 --> 00:10:12,435
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not that we will discuss, Hey, it's late.

119
00:10:12,475 --> 00:10:13,035
[SPEAKER_07]: I retired.

120
00:10:13,055 --> 00:10:13,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Should we keep going?

121
00:10:14,216 --> 00:10:15,297
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the meeting is over.

122
00:10:15,317 --> 00:10:16,938
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the language of the role.

123
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:18,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so, um,

124
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:25,192
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, to me, it seems like 9.30, I'd like to be out at 9.32.

125
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:34,697
[SPEAKER_07]: I go to bed at nine o'clock on a regular night, but we will have, we will certainly have to discuss going to weekly meetings.

126
00:10:35,098 --> 00:10:37,079
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know the administration's not interested in that.

127
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:42,102
[SPEAKER_07]: We will have to go to weekly meetings if we're quitting at 9.30 on a regular basis.

128
00:10:42,122 --> 00:10:44,603
[SPEAKER_07]: We have one item on the agenda and we went to 9.30.

129
00:10:47,391 --> 00:10:51,334
[SPEAKER_07]: I assume that we have lots of work to do, that the school committee is not a rubber stamp.

130
00:10:51,654 --> 00:11:02,000
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, when this item goes to the floor of our meeting, this could drag one meeting past 9.30 and just approving these set of rules if the public has comments on it.

131
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:07,423
[SPEAKER_07]: So the intent was 11 o'clock is the sort of the red line.

132
00:11:08,744 --> 00:11:14,748
[SPEAKER_07]: As it's approaching 11 o'clock, we make it clear we're gonna bump everything or we have a conversation about

133
00:11:15,186 --> 00:11:24,309
[SPEAKER_07]: the two extra items that are on the agenda that we can't get to, but that we all have something in our minds that is like, okay, this is getting ridiculous.

134
00:11:24,929 --> 00:11:32,872
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got to stop because we all agree, none of us, I'm not, and I've heard from other members, none of us are at our best at 11 o'clock.

135
00:11:33,488 --> 00:11:41,230
[SPEAKER_07]: and certainly the administration and God forbid, principals have to be at a meeting that late because they have to be at school to crack a dawn the next day.

136
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:49,572
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's all the 11 o'clock was intended for, but that was the intent.

137
00:11:51,553 --> 00:11:51,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

138
00:11:55,394 --> 00:11:56,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Limbu Graham, did you have a hand up?

139
00:11:57,343 --> 00:11:57,603
[SPEAKER_11]: I did.

140
00:11:57,623 --> 00:12:02,207
[SPEAKER_11]: I do.

141
00:12:03,508 --> 00:12:10,293
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think we've been elected to do a job, and I don't think the public particularly elected us to do an easy job.

142
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:15,137
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think there's a general expectation that we'll come and do the job, whatever it takes.

143
00:12:16,098 --> 00:12:20,962
[SPEAKER_11]: And having said that, I'm also not a proponent of meeting very, very late into the evening.

144
00:12:22,122 --> 00:12:37,348
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the reason why I voted against not starting a meeting until 6.30 p.m., because as I've been tracking, literally, since we took that vote, we never get to new business before seven o'clock, really before 7.30.

145
00:12:37,928 --> 00:12:51,433
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have a solid hour of things we have to accomplish easily, sometimes more, that happen before the kinds of items that the public would be wanting to weigh in on

146
00:12:52,572 --> 00:13:03,594
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's the reason why I think 6.30 is late to start, given that we're all concerned about the administration and the demands we're placing on them in particular.

147
00:13:03,614 --> 00:13:11,475
[SPEAKER_11]: They are full-time employees, they're not elected officials, but they're sort of stuck with us for the duration.

148
00:13:11,595 --> 00:13:21,377
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would be a proponent of starting the meeting at six and saying that the end time of the meeting

149
00:13:22,008 --> 00:13:22,948
[SPEAKER_11]: would be 1030.

150
00:13:23,248 --> 00:13:36,872
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like that gives us a bigger, better window to actually accomplish our business without having to go to weekly meetings, bringing in the outside a little bit from 11 o'clock, and really not compromising the public's ability to participate.

151
00:13:38,532 --> 00:13:42,253
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would welcome my fellow committee members' thoughts on that.

152
00:13:44,294 --> 00:13:48,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Edward, Vincent, did you have a comment or not?

153
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,395
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you unmuted.

154
00:13:50,253 --> 00:14:07,983
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just listening to what's being said, I think when the meetings need to run long or if there's a heavier agenda and we need to have longer meetings that those will happen.

155
00:14:08,543 --> 00:14:16,708
[SPEAKER_00]: And to member Rousseau's point, I think that some of our meetings just by nature, they do end up running long.

156
00:14:17,569 --> 00:14:18,449
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say to you,

157
00:14:20,604 --> 00:14:32,089
[SPEAKER_00]: that the 11 o'clock end time was shocking to a lot of colleagues that I just was getting some feedback for from MASC.

158
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:41,534
[SPEAKER_00]: They have stated to us that efficient meetings should be anywhere between an hour and a half to two hours long to be able to

159
00:14:42,154 --> 00:14:43,216
[SPEAKER_00]: go through an agenda.

160
00:14:43,796 --> 00:14:54,450
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we on the school side have been making a significant effort to try to be as concise as possible, and not have.

161
00:14:55,773 --> 00:15:01,337
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, excessive reports that we're not able to get through it in a reasonable amount of time.

162
00:15:02,037 --> 00:15:23,293
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether we start at six o'clock and you say to yourself, a two hour window that would still bring us to 8.30, whether you start at 6.30 to 8.30, nine o'clock, 9.30, I had just felt that that would be reasonable from a planning perspective.

163
00:15:25,356 --> 00:15:37,773
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes for a very long day for the school side staff, because it's not like anyone starts work at noontime, or two in the afternoon, and says that they're going to work until 11pm.

164
00:15:39,508 --> 00:15:50,020
[SPEAKER_00]: If necessary, like everyone is in the field working a full day, and then going to the school committee meetings which we understand have to happen.

165
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:55,385
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm just thinking about bandwidth and trying to have that balance.

166
00:15:57,064 --> 00:16:16,085
[SPEAKER_00]: So my hope would be that we would not have many meetings that have to go to 11pm and trying to keep the agendas concise enough that, you know, it could be a robust two hours, including the conversations that take place to two and a half hours and if we need three hours or four hours.

167
00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:24,361
[SPEAKER_00]: then you as a body could just vote to say, you know, this is an important topic today.

168
00:16:24,481 --> 00:16:27,282
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to continue to, you know, push through and get to the end.

169
00:16:27,582 --> 00:16:44,207
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we, I think sometimes there have been votes where, especially when amendments were being made and these were meetings that went so late into the evening that by the time it took place, people weren't really sure on, you know,

170
00:16:45,407 --> 00:16:50,209
[SPEAKER_00]: what was the final motion, because it just got too late.

171
00:16:50,349 --> 00:17:03,674
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just feel for everyone's work-life balance and mental health, that having a reasonable cutoff time would be better.

172
00:17:08,576 --> 00:17:09,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Kreatz?

173
00:17:09,865 --> 00:17:12,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, and I'm going to keep my motion on the floor.

174
00:17:12,686 --> 00:17:25,709
[SPEAKER_08]: I happen to, you know, understand and agree with the superintendent, I have to get up at 445am, and I am just exhausted by 930, and it's the next day.

175
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,872
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like I was on a boat or a plane.

176
00:17:32,332 --> 00:17:33,133
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't get up.

177
00:17:33,193 --> 00:17:33,873
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't think.

178
00:17:34,433 --> 00:17:35,174
[SPEAKER_08]: I drink coffee.

179
00:17:35,294 --> 00:17:36,114
[SPEAKER_08]: It just doesn't matter.

180
00:17:37,295 --> 00:17:38,055
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't focus.

181
00:17:38,155 --> 00:17:42,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Even the next day, you're affected by the very, very, very long day.

182
00:17:43,698 --> 00:17:48,341
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can't drink coffee before the school committee meeting, because then I'll be up all night.

183
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:53,604
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just I'm going to keep my motion on the floor, and I can hear from both sides.

184
00:17:53,684 --> 00:17:56,706
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just think that if we, you know,

185
00:17:57,566 --> 00:18:22,591
[SPEAKER_08]: have this time frame and we know that we're going later and there's important agenda items or there are people from the public just as i mentioned in the part of the motion that a motion can be made to extend the meeting until xx time and i think that would be reasonable for the administrators the school committee the public and just the students just everybody i'm just trying to make it

186
00:18:23,391 --> 00:18:37,641
[SPEAKER_08]: equitable for everybody, everybody has to get somewhere in the next morning, whether it's school, work, family, everybody's got to get up, you know, so I'm just trying to, you know, I've seen our meetings, they can carry on, we're doing much better.

187
00:18:38,682 --> 00:18:44,027
[SPEAKER_08]: And sometimes there are items that take longer, but that's not typical.

188
00:18:44,568 --> 00:18:47,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Typical, we do run to 930.

189
00:18:47,191 --> 00:18:56,079
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's always the occasional late meeting, which can happen with a controversial or very important topic.

190
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,582
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're not like,

191
00:18:59,704 --> 00:19:03,967
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not blocking it down to just 6.30 to 9.30, that's it, the meeting's over.

192
00:19:04,427 --> 00:19:10,272
[SPEAKER_08]: We're still giving, as part of my motion, I'm still giving the offer to extend the meeting if a motion is made.

193
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,574
[SPEAKER_08]: But I won't talk, I let other people talk.

194
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:13,814
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

195
00:19:13,974 --> 00:19:14,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

196
00:19:14,775 --> 00:19:16,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I ask Ms.

197
00:19:16,316 --> 00:19:18,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Wise, if you could mark member Ms.

198
00:19:18,818 --> 00:19:24,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Stone as present, and then just also maybe a compromise, maybe we could go to 10 p.m.

199
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,884
[SPEAKER_05]: and always can extend it after 10.

200
00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:28,538
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good compromise.

201
00:19:28,578 --> 00:19:29,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we can have a motion on the floor.

202
00:19:33,136 --> 00:19:35,098
[SPEAKER_12]: I currently emotion with a second.

203
00:19:36,358 --> 00:19:37,119
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we want.

204
00:19:37,639 --> 00:19:44,564
[SPEAKER_12]: So, member credits put emotion I seconded it we were debating the motion but the.

205
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:47,906
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're suggesting an amendment to member credits motion.

206
00:19:47,926 --> 00:19:51,929
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure what you're suggesting but there's a, there is a motion on the floor with a second.

207
00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:57,552
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to mention that would be up to member credits if she wants to withdraw and present.

208
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:03,447
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't wanna withdraw the motion, but I'm thinking, I heard from Ms.

209
00:20:03,487 --> 00:20:12,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Graham and maybe we could make the alternative where we could start the meeting at six, we could end the meeting at 9.30.

210
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:21,136
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the additional half hour so that we're not keeping the administrators past 9.30 unless there's an extension to do so.

211
00:20:21,556 --> 00:20:25,458
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm making a motion now to change the start time to 6 p.m.

212
00:20:26,218 --> 00:20:27,359
[SPEAKER_08]: and the end time to 9.30 p.m.

213
00:20:29,327 --> 00:20:33,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Just if I may, that wasn't Member Graham's suggestion.

214
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,428
[SPEAKER_05]: She said six to 1030.

215
00:20:34,928 --> 00:20:36,229
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to make that clear.

216
00:20:37,449 --> 00:20:41,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, and I'm sorry, I meant to say the start time that she mentioned.

217
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:47,692
[SPEAKER_08]: So my motion, I'm going to change to, let me just get back.

218
00:20:47,812 --> 00:20:51,573
[SPEAKER_08]: I just have to close the window to look at the words here, sorry.

219
00:20:51,993 --> 00:20:56,674
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm amending my original motion to read

220
00:20:58,369 --> 00:21:01,191
[SPEAKER_08]: The regular school committee will begin at 6 p.m.

221
00:21:02,572 --> 00:21:06,175
[SPEAKER_08]: No meeting of the school committee will go beyond 9.30 p.m.

222
00:21:07,156 --> 00:21:13,921
[SPEAKER_08]: If the school committee is still meeting at 9.30 p.m., the chair will ask, is there a motion to recess the meeting until a certain time?

223
00:21:15,022 --> 00:21:26,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Or is there a motion to extend the meeting beyond 9.30 in the evening and state the time so that everybody understands that there is an end time coming, whether it's going to be 10 or 10.30?

224
00:21:28,212 --> 00:21:31,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, a motion to continue the meeting requires the two thirds vote.

225
00:21:31,354 --> 00:21:40,841
[SPEAKER_08]: So the time changes would be 6.00 PM to 9.30 PM second member.

226
00:21:41,661 --> 00:21:44,744
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll just, it's four 30 now member Hays and member Graham.

227
00:21:48,146 --> 00:21:49,347
[SPEAKER_12]: I also have my hand up mayor.

228
00:21:49,387 --> 00:21:49,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

229
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:51,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and then member McLaughlin.

230
00:21:53,564 --> 00:21:59,149
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just feel like we had a pretty lengthy discussion about the six versus 630 start time last time.

231
00:21:59,509 --> 00:22:03,072
[SPEAKER_10]: And if we're going to keep revisiting these, it's going to make this meeting really lengthy, but

232
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:19,803
[SPEAKER_10]: We did have a discussion about how the six o'clock time is much harder for community members who want to watch, because that's a time when either they're just getting home from work, a lot of people, or busy getting dinner ready, whatever.

233
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:24,527
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we had a long discussion about keeping it at 6.30 because of that very reason.

234
00:22:26,188 --> 00:22:30,732
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would vote to stay with that, but I guess we'll take a vote on the motion.

235
00:22:31,955 --> 00:22:37,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and you can always motion to sever, start and end time if you want, Member Hays, Member Graham, and then Member McLaughlin.

236
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:50,162
[SPEAKER_11]: I am sensitive to the fact that balancing all of these competing priorities is really hard.

237
00:22:51,463 --> 00:22:58,125
[SPEAKER_11]: I just go back to thinking about the job we have been elected to do, and sometimes that job is going to be longer.

238
00:22:59,046 --> 00:22:59,726
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it has to,

239
00:23:00,449 --> 00:23:02,645
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, there have to be some guardrails that help us.

240
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,722
[SPEAKER_11]: be efficient and brief and all those things.

241
00:23:07,863 --> 00:23:18,290
[SPEAKER_11]: So I do think starting at six, I don't think that erodes the public's ability to participate because like I said, we don't get to those agenda items until much, much later in the game.

242
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:21,432
[SPEAKER_11]: Our meetings are recorded and can be watched at any time.

243
00:23:21,452 --> 00:23:25,435
[SPEAKER_11]: So I feel like that does mitigate some of that six o'clock start time concern.

244
00:23:25,455 --> 00:23:30,419
[SPEAKER_11]: I think if we could all agree on like a six to 10

245
00:23:31,266 --> 00:23:34,868
[SPEAKER_11]: time frame, I think that would actually be a nice compromise.

246
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:40,651
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, continuing to work to not be meeting at 10pm.

247
00:23:40,731 --> 00:23:55,360
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, Kathy, my suggestion would be six to 10, so that we're not fighting by a vote of two thirds about whether to continue a meeting, which could quickly become about avoiding agenda items.

248
00:23:55,963 --> 00:23:57,865
[SPEAKER_11]: and disappointing the public who showed up to speak.

249
00:23:57,945 --> 00:24:17,319
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would like to see us think about the consequences of this in real time, playing out, needing two thirds of a vote to continue at times when we have a room full of people who came to speak is not going to be pleasant.

250
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,362
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would rather our outside times

251
00:24:21,463 --> 00:24:28,930
[SPEAKER_11]: be perceived as reasonable by everybody and never be construed that this committee is trying not to work hard on behalf of the students of Medford.

252
00:24:31,152 --> 00:24:31,913
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Member Graham.

253
00:24:32,133 --> 00:24:34,195
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Member, thank you, Member Graham.

254
00:24:34,435 --> 00:24:35,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin.

255
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:36,878
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

256
00:24:37,339 --> 00:24:41,823
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate my colleagues' willingness for negotiation.

257
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:52,352
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just also for clarity's sake, wanna just say, I don't think for me certainly, and I don't think for any of our colleagues, it's about working less.

258
00:24:52,432 --> 00:24:54,294
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's about working more efficiently.

259
00:24:54,454 --> 00:24:59,118
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think everybody would agree that a lot of these meetings can go on.

260
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:03,402
[SPEAKER_12]: And in some cases it's reasonable, in other cases I feel like it's not.

261
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:10,644
[SPEAKER_12]: But I do think that some of the rules that are being proposed could alleviate some of the issues that we've had in the past.

262
00:25:10,664 --> 00:25:17,285
[SPEAKER_12]: So hopefully we'll see more efficient meetings based on some of the rules that are being proposed that we're going to be bringing before the committee.

263
00:25:17,825 --> 00:25:19,005
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's that piece of it.

264
00:25:20,266 --> 00:25:26,407
[SPEAKER_12]: And I am, again, super sensitive to the staff and thinking about an additional four hours after their long day.

265
00:25:27,287 --> 00:25:31,028
[SPEAKER_12]: It is a lot, but I'm also sort of open to the idea of a

266
00:25:31,602 --> 00:25:35,883
[SPEAKER_12]: six to 10 window with the full understanding that 10 is not the cutoff.

267
00:25:37,223 --> 00:25:41,104
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's not the sort of the norm, it would be the cutoff.

268
00:25:42,105 --> 00:25:50,387
[SPEAKER_12]: But again, if folks are interested in severing the motion and looking at, you know, the start time and the end time, I think that's also a good consideration.

269
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:51,147
[SPEAKER_12]: But for me,

270
00:25:51,693 --> 00:25:52,854
[SPEAKER_12]: I do think four-hour meetings.

271
00:25:52,894 --> 00:25:53,974
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, think about a business.

272
00:25:54,035 --> 00:26:00,459
[SPEAKER_12]: If you were in a four-hour meeting and people were like, you know, this is four-hour to meet, you know, after two hours, what's the productivity level?

273
00:26:01,479 --> 00:26:02,420
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we would think about that.

274
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,062
[SPEAKER_12]: Now I know businesses have more meetings than every two weeks.

275
00:26:05,142 --> 00:26:10,365
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, the other option is, you know, meet more frequently at less times.

276
00:26:10,425 --> 00:26:15,308
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that that would also be a whole discussion that people would not, you know, there would be the pros and cons again.

277
00:26:15,348 --> 00:26:17,950
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm just trying to put a few things out there, but I want to make it really clear.

278
00:26:18,637 --> 00:26:20,599
[SPEAKER_12]: One, it's not about hard work.

279
00:26:20,639 --> 00:26:21,699
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we're all hard workers.

280
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:25,142
[SPEAKER_12]: Two, it's about efficiency and having efficient meetings.

281
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:34,409
[SPEAKER_12]: And three, for me, it's about the sensitivity towards the staff that had very early mornings and very packed days.

282
00:26:34,949 --> 00:26:35,309
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

283
00:26:35,329 --> 00:26:45,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, there's a motion on the floor for a start time of six and an end time of 10 with the ability to extend, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

284
00:26:45,697 --> 00:26:46,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call.

285
00:26:47,968 --> 00:26:49,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor, did you say that?

286
00:26:50,149 --> 00:26:52,429
[SPEAKER_08]: What about, I didn't withdraw my motion.

287
00:26:52,449 --> 00:26:56,190
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the current motion is 6 p.m.

288
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,650
[SPEAKER_07]: start, 9.30 p.m.

289
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:57,910
[SPEAKER_07]: end.

290
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:00,631
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the motion that Ms.

291
00:27:00,651 --> 00:27:01,731
[SPEAKER_08]: McLaughlin seconded me on.

292
00:27:01,751 --> 00:27:02,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Gotcha.

293
00:27:02,992 --> 00:27:04,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

294
00:27:04,172 --> 00:27:05,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Hays, did you want to speak one more time?

295
00:27:05,732 --> 00:27:10,714
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know how to do that.

296
00:27:10,734 --> 00:27:12,294
[SPEAKER_10]: You suggested severing the motions.

297
00:27:12,854 --> 00:27:13,554
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to sever.

298
00:27:13,574 --> 00:27:15,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to sever.

299
00:27:16,095 --> 00:27:16,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

300
00:27:17,113 --> 00:27:19,175
[SPEAKER_05]: seconded by Member McLaughlin.

301
00:27:19,635 --> 00:27:20,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call vote.

302
00:27:22,437 --> 00:27:28,742
[SPEAKER_12]: So the motion to sever, just to be clear, you're severing the start time and end time, so we'll take a vote on each item, is that correct?

303
00:27:29,202 --> 00:27:29,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

304
00:27:32,024 --> 00:27:35,466
[SPEAKER_12]: But first, we're voting on whether to sever the motion, is that correct?

305
00:27:35,506 --> 00:27:39,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, first motion to sever is then seconded, and we'll take a roll call on that.

306
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:40,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

307
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:40,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham?

308
00:27:41,511 --> 00:27:41,771

[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative.

320
00:28:06,037 --> 00:28:12,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Motions are severed and there's a motion on the floor by Member Kreatz, seconded by Member McLaughlin to start the meeting at 6 p.m.

321
00:28:12,122 --> 00:28:13,263
[SPEAKER_05]: We can take a roll call, please.

322
00:28:17,504 --> 00:28:17,964

[SPEAKER_07]: Member Hays?

[SPEAKER_07]: Member McLaughlin?

347
00:29:05,304 --> 00:29:05,664
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

348
00:29:07,225 --> 00:29:07,886
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Mustone?

349
00:29:08,506 --> 00:29:08,766
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

350
00:29:10,788 --> 00:29:11,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau?

351
00:29:12,229 --> 00:29:12,489
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

352
00:29:12,849 --> 00:29:13,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor Longo turns.

353
00:29:14,467 --> 00:29:16,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, five in the affirmative, two in the negative.

354
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:19,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Meeting shall end at 9.30 unless extended.

355
00:29:21,911 --> 00:29:28,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, moving on to pages 10, 11, and 12, where we left off last time.

356
00:29:29,315 --> 00:29:30,175
[SPEAKER_08]: What numbers are those?

357
00:29:30,196 --> 00:29:35,398
[SPEAKER_14]: Starting number 56.

358
00:29:35,438 --> 00:29:35,738
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, 67 to 75.

359
00:29:44,903 --> 00:29:45,683
[SPEAKER_11]: Mayor.

360
00:29:46,944 --> 00:29:49,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, member Graham, I just heard.

361
00:29:50,426 --> 00:30:00,352
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe that at the last meeting we put number 67 on the table and I would like to make a motion to take it off the table so we can discuss.

362
00:30:00,372 --> 00:30:06,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to take number 67 off the table by member Graham, seconded by member McLaughlin.

363
00:30:06,495 --> 00:30:07,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call, please.

364
00:30:08,276 --> 00:30:08,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham.

365
00:30:09,317 --> 00:30:09,537
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

366
00:30:10,318 --> 00:30:10,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Kreatz.

367
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:11,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

368
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:13,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Hays.

369
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:14,280
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

370
00:30:15,224 --> 00:30:15,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Member McLaughlin?

371
00:30:16,644 --> 00:30:16,964
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

372
00:30:17,945 --> 00:30:18,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Mustone?

373
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:20,746
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

374
00:30:21,606 --> 00:30:22,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau, yes.

375
00:30:22,826 --> 00:30:23,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

376
00:30:24,247 --> 00:30:27,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative.

377
00:30:27,427 --> 00:30:28,588
[SPEAKER_05]: 67 has been taken off the table.

378
00:30:34,109 --> 00:30:37,190
[SPEAKER_11]: Mayor, I would make a motion to approve that as written.

379
00:30:39,311 --> 00:30:41,611
[SPEAKER_12]: Can we get a little, I'm sorry, Mayor, may I?

380
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,532
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, Member McLaughlin.

381
00:30:43,895 --> 00:30:45,959
[SPEAKER_12]: Can we get a little explanation of this a bit?

382
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:48,022
[SPEAKER_12]: It feels very complicated.

383
00:30:48,042 --> 00:30:52,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau.

384
00:30:53,572 --> 00:30:53,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

385
00:30:53,993 --> 00:30:55,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it is complicated.

386
00:30:55,155 --> 00:30:56,737
[SPEAKER_07]: There is absolutely no question about it.

387
00:30:57,805 --> 00:31:02,348
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually, this is just Robert's rules here.

388
00:31:03,809 --> 00:31:18,298
[SPEAKER_07]: It is, I included it as a rule because it's so complicated, but also because it often gets confused between, rescinded gets confused with, what's the one after, the motion to reconsider.

389
00:31:18,699 --> 00:31:26,784
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thought it was really important to have the two of them back to back and have them in here so that if a member is in a meeting and needs to,

390
00:31:28,407 --> 00:31:36,651
[SPEAKER_07]: do one of these two things, or they don't have to go, you know, you can go to the Roberts Rules website, you will not find this, they want you to buy their book.

391
00:31:37,791 --> 00:31:40,893
[SPEAKER_07]: So you'll have to find your book and you'll have to figure out the right way to do it.

392
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:46,195
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is, there is nothing in this that is not exactly what Roberts Rules requires.

393
00:31:47,416 --> 00:31:50,577
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I do want that to be clear that I've not changed the rules.

394
00:31:50,717 --> 00:31:54,579
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just, this is a particular rule that I'm elevating into the document because

395
00:31:55,086 --> 00:32:02,671
[SPEAKER_07]: I know as a member, I think this is a complicated thing to keep those two things under, to keep them clear.

396
00:32:03,372 --> 00:32:07,895
[SPEAKER_07]: And it felt like other members might also find that helpful.

397
00:32:11,918 --> 00:32:12,178
[SPEAKER_12]: Mayor.

398
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:13,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin.

399
00:32:14,354 --> 00:32:16,756
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for that explanation.

400
00:32:16,796 --> 00:32:17,497
[SPEAKER_12]: That's helpful.

401
00:32:17,677 --> 00:32:27,706
[SPEAKER_12]: And I do appreciate at the end of that, of the rule having in parentheses that, you know, see Robert's Rules of Order or per Robert's Rules of Order.

402
00:32:28,487 --> 00:32:34,011
[SPEAKER_12]: And, and, you know, when that's the case for this, and I guess the next one, that would be really helpful.

403
00:32:34,071 --> 00:32:35,653
[SPEAKER_12]: So folks know that that is part of the

404
00:32:36,493 --> 00:32:37,674
[SPEAKER_12]: rescind and reconsider.

405
00:32:37,894 --> 00:32:48,498
[SPEAKER_12]: And I find that with my Robert's Rules of Order book, I often have to read it a couple of times to understand the process and also sometimes YouTube videos or what have you.

406
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:50,078
[SPEAKER_12]: So I do think that's helpful.

407
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:53,220
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's a little complicated as one reads it.

408
00:32:53,900 --> 00:33:04,624
[SPEAKER_12]: And I assume others will think the same, but if we have the Robert's Rules of Order and I might make a friendly suggestion for a hyperlink or something, that would be really helpful.

409
00:33:06,576 --> 00:33:07,897
[SPEAKER_12]: to Robert's Rules, please.

410
00:33:09,097 --> 00:33:10,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau?

411
00:33:10,998 --> 00:33:11,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

412
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:24,186
[SPEAKER_07]: I was gonna wait till we get to the end of this, but I was actually going to make a motion to be given authority to go through and add Robert Rules of Order references to all the places that it belongs.

413
00:33:24,626 --> 00:33:33,511
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have those available right now, but that was something I was gonna suggest that we do add to this document, so.

414
00:33:35,443 --> 00:33:56,214
[SPEAKER_12]: motion to add Robert's rules of order to the specific rules being proposed when it's relevant with a hyperlink to Robert's rules so that for posterity, people who succeed us will have access to what it was we were actually referring to.

415
00:34:02,992 --> 00:34:08,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, the word hyperlink was used, hyperlinks mean going to a webpage, but these are not available on the web.

416
00:34:09,996 --> 00:34:14,098
[SPEAKER_07]: So can we just, would you change the language of that to be just a reference?

417
00:34:15,558 --> 00:34:20,621
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, a reference, but I would prefer a hyperlink because these will be available on the website at some point, correct?

418
00:34:21,441 --> 00:34:22,802
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Robert's rules.

419
00:34:23,582 --> 00:34:25,483
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the rules, our rules.

420
00:34:26,504 --> 00:34:32,627
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure I'm following what the request is.

421
00:34:34,284 --> 00:34:35,625
[SPEAKER_09]: So may I, Mayor?

422
00:34:35,646 --> 00:34:40,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Other than anything, I believe member Graham has her hand up.

423
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:40,910
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.

424
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:45,434
[SPEAKER_12]: So all I'm saying is that I think the reference to Robert's Rules is great.

425
00:34:45,854 --> 00:34:52,440
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I would ask that there be a hyperlink once this is on the website to the Robert's Rules because I am assuming our rules will be on our website.

426
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:58,405
[SPEAKER_12]: And then if somebody is reading, say, a member of the community or a new school committee member for orientation or anything,

427
00:34:59,353 --> 00:35:10,960
[SPEAKER_12]: Our rules on our public school website, and they see something referencing Robert rules of order for one of the specific rules that they could click, you know, to that hyperlink and be brought there so that they could learn more about.

428
00:35:11,562 --> 00:35:13,683
[SPEAKER_12]: what it is we really set our rules up on.

429
00:35:13,763 --> 00:35:15,184
[SPEAKER_12]: So if that, I hope that clarifies.

430
00:35:15,224 --> 00:35:32,953
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would amend my motion to say when the, you know, Robert's rules of reference for any of the motions, I mean, for any of the rules that are proposed when it's appropriate, parenthetically or referenced, and then a hyperlink for when those go live online.

431
00:35:35,455 --> 00:35:35,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Number Graham.

432
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:44,965
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, just to clarify, you want a hyperlink to the General Roberts Rules of Order website.

433
00:35:45,165 --> 00:35:46,186
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that what you're asking for?

434
00:35:47,086 --> 00:35:53,468
[SPEAKER_11]: Because this specific detail is not available on the website because they want you to buy the book.

435
00:35:54,449 --> 00:35:55,989
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that was member Rousseau's point.

436
00:35:56,390 --> 00:36:01,412
[SPEAKER_12]: For this specific one for rescind, but it is for, yes, but there's lots of information for the others.

437
00:36:01,472 --> 00:36:04,513
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think not specific to the particular

438
00:36:05,109 --> 00:36:08,470
[SPEAKER_12]: motion, but in general, so that people know to what we're referring.

439
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:08,990
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

440
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:09,370
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

441
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:11,231
[SPEAKER_12]: Second.

442
00:36:12,491 --> 00:36:15,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau?

443
00:36:16,232 --> 00:36:19,173
[SPEAKER_07]: The website does not actually provide you with the Roberts Rules of Order.

444
00:36:19,713 --> 00:36:26,655
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a few, there's an FAQ where you can sort of see some summaries of questions that are common,

445
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:37,845
[SPEAKER_07]: And even within their own FAQ, they will include a reference, you know, the RONR page 146 and edition 29 or 12 or whatever it is.

446
00:36:39,427 --> 00:36:50,035
[SPEAKER_07]: You cannot refer to the individual rules of Robert Rules of Order on the web because they are proprietary copyrighted or whatever the right language is.

447
00:36:51,176 --> 00:36:56,240
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is not possible to add a reference to what the language in Robert Rules of Order is.

448
00:36:58,101 --> 00:36:58,401
[SPEAKER_12]: Mayor.

449
00:36:59,182 --> 00:37:00,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin.

450
00:37:01,524 --> 00:37:01,944
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

451
00:37:02,365 --> 00:37:06,908
[SPEAKER_12]: So to that end, it doesn't have to be that specific to the specific roles.

452
00:37:07,069 --> 00:37:16,496
[SPEAKER_12]: I am asking that people are directed to what and including school committee members are directed to what Robert's Rules of Orders actually means and where they can get more reference.

453
00:37:16,697 --> 00:37:18,238
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that by going to the

454
00:37:18,974 --> 00:37:23,796
[SPEAKER_12]: home page of Robert's Rules, they can see, yes, books, they can see references.

455
00:37:23,836 --> 00:37:39,244
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure they can understand that, oh, if I Google or YouTube this, I'll probably be able to figure it out, but at least some landing page, something that explains to them what that actually means, because otherwise it has no anchor, no meaning, especially for a lay person.

456
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:46,808
[SPEAKER_12]: So just simply asking that we include the hyperlink, not specific to each of the motions as member Graham seconded.

457
00:37:47,464 --> 00:37:50,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, motion by Member Laughlin, seconded by Member Graham.

458
00:37:50,145 --> 00:37:50,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Roll call, please.

459
00:37:51,946 --> 00:37:52,987
[SPEAKER_07]: I need the language, Mayor.

460
00:37:53,047 --> 00:37:54,848
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't call it until I can type it.

461
00:37:56,789 --> 00:37:57,949
[SPEAKER_12]: Shall I state it again?

462
00:37:57,969 --> 00:38:00,850
[SPEAKER_12]: Please.

463
00:38:01,211 --> 00:38:10,095
[SPEAKER_12]: I would ask that there'll be parenthetical information for each of the motions that are Robert's Rules of Order specific, as in

464
00:38:11,219 --> 00:38:15,341
[SPEAKER_12]: example 67 part D, see Robert's rules of order.

465
00:38:15,942 --> 00:38:25,067
[SPEAKER_12]: And then, you know, at the end of the document for reference material or what have you, which this doc, I would ask that this document ultimately be posted online.

466
00:38:25,087 --> 00:38:27,188
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's part two of my motion.

467
00:38:27,248 --> 00:38:39,175
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the third part is that at the end of that document, there'll be obvious, you know, an API reference to Robert's rules of order with a hyperlink to a website, please.

468
00:38:44,575 --> 00:38:46,495
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll go back to the recording and write all that down.

469
00:38:47,456 --> 00:38:48,116
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there a second?

470
00:38:48,216 --> 00:38:48,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

471
00:38:48,976 --> 00:38:50,176
[SPEAKER_01]: Second by member Graham.

472
00:38:50,196 --> 00:38:55,037
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Graham.

473
00:38:55,837 --> 00:38:56,077
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

474
00:38:56,857 --> 00:38:57,337
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Kreatz.

475
00:38:58,257 --> 00:38:58,477
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

476
00:38:59,137 --> 00:38:59,618
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Haynes.

477
00:39:00,418 --> 00:39:00,678
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

478
00:39:01,478 --> 00:39:02,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Member McLaughlin.

479
00:39:02,638 --> 00:39:02,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

480
00:39:03,318 --> 00:39:03,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

481
00:39:04,318 --> 00:39:04,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Mustone.

482
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:05,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

483
00:39:06,819 --> 00:39:07,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Rissell.

484
00:39:07,399 --> 00:39:07,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

485
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:10,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor Longovern.

486
00:39:10,899 --> 00:39:11,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

487
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

488
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Paper passes.

489
00:39:14,913 --> 00:39:15,513
[SPEAKER_05]: As amended.

490
00:39:18,495 --> 00:39:19,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

491
00:39:21,137 --> 00:39:26,140
[SPEAKER_07]: I have in my notes that member Graham had made a motion to accept the rule as written.

492
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:29,242
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if that got lost.

493
00:39:34,145 --> 00:39:38,167
[SPEAKER_05]: We can second separate roll call on that if you'd like.

494
00:39:38,407 --> 00:39:41,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, seconded by member McLaughlin, roll call.

495
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Graham?

496
00:39:43,751 --> 00:39:43,931
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

497
00:39:46,146 --> 00:39:46,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Kreatz?

498
00:39:47,527 --> 00:39:47,747
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

499
00:39:48,627 --> 00:39:49,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Hays?

500
00:39:49,948 --> 00:39:50,228
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

501
00:39:51,149 --> 00:39:51,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Member McLaughlin?

502
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:52,750
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

503
00:39:53,671 --> 00:39:54,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Mustone?

504
00:39:55,012 --> 00:39:55,252
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

505
00:39:56,372 --> 00:39:57,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Rossell, yes.

506
00:39:58,754 --> 00:39:59,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor Longo?

507
00:39:59,995 --> 00:40:02,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, paper passes.

508
00:40:04,278 --> 00:40:06,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any questions on page 10, 11, or 12?

509
00:40:09,647 --> 00:40:10,407
[SPEAKER_08]: What numbers are those?

510
00:40:10,467 --> 00:40:14,548
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, Mayor, because I just have mine in a Google Drive, so I just have the numbers.

511
00:40:14,588 --> 00:40:15,189
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have pages.

512
00:40:15,249 --> 00:40:16,229
[SPEAKER_08]: They're different pages.

513
00:40:17,609 --> 00:40:21,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Number 68 to 78 we can start with.

514
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:24,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I'm just going through those numbers.

515
00:40:26,212 --> 00:40:29,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, so I do have some concerns about number 77.

516
00:40:34,785 --> 00:40:38,170
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually even reached out to the city council.

517
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:56,264
[SPEAKER_08]: So it says all requests passed by the city council that pertain to member public schools will be sent to the school committee to be part of the next agenda in accordance with the school committee procedure and timing is found in addendum one, add item to agenda.

518
00:40:56,925 --> 00:41:04,232
[SPEAKER_08]: The city clerk is authorized to add items to the school committee agenda, following our established procedure and add item to agenda.

519
00:41:05,153 --> 00:41:09,296
[SPEAKER_08]: The school committee may refer such requests to the superintendent upon a majority vote.

520
00:41:09,977 --> 00:41:21,026
[SPEAKER_08]: The superintendent is not authorized to respond to city council request to attend city council meetings or perform any actions requested by the city council without a majority vote.

521
00:41:21,727 --> 00:41:24,229
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just reading this and, you know, it's just.

522
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:28,313
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the city council is another body.

523
00:41:29,074 --> 00:41:34,358
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have the add the item, add the agenda item instructions for us.

524
00:41:35,018 --> 00:41:42,524
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to give our instructions to the city clerk to add items to the school committee agenda.

525
00:41:44,366 --> 00:41:46,868
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think, I don't think that is a good idea.

526
00:41:46,888 --> 00:41:47,628
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure.

527
00:41:48,609 --> 00:41:54,492
[SPEAKER_08]: whether I'm misunderstanding this, and then I wasn't sure, and it's not something that's currently being done.

528
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,273
[SPEAKER_08]: I did, you know, ask about that.

529
00:41:57,873 --> 00:42:09,959
[SPEAKER_08]: And then where the superintendent is not authorized to respond or request to any email, you know, correspondence with city council, I feel it's too restrictive.

530
00:42:10,659 --> 00:42:11,900
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know,

531
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:20,785
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just wondering if I could maybe hear from the superintendent on what her thoughts are on the way that this rule is written.

532
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:24,087
[SPEAKER_08]: I really just don't really follow it.

533
00:42:25,548 --> 00:42:26,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Member Kreatz.

534
00:42:26,709 --> 00:42:29,211
[SPEAKER_05]: I tend to agree, if I may, from the chair.

535
00:42:29,231 --> 00:42:34,775
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it definitely restricts the superintendent's ability to do her job.

536
00:42:34,935 --> 00:42:37,958
[SPEAKER_05]: So I won't be voting to approve this either.

537
00:42:37,978 --> 00:42:43,262
[SPEAKER_05]: If anybody else has a comment, or Dr. Edwardson, Member Ruseau?

538
00:42:44,325 --> 00:42:44,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

539
00:42:45,807 --> 00:43:01,945
[SPEAKER_07]: So, the part about adding to the agenda I actually, I don't know what the right process should be the city council in the last couple of years has in fact asked things that they wanted the school committee to respond to, and we got an email from somebody I think in the mayor's office.

540
00:43:04,042 --> 00:43:15,455
[SPEAKER_07]: To all of us as individuals, we as individuals have no authority to respond to the for the school committee, so we have no process right now at the school at the city council wants to ask the school committee a question.

541
00:43:17,515 --> 00:43:19,175
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no way for that to happen.

542
00:43:20,336 --> 00:43:27,658
[SPEAKER_07]: And any of us showing up at the city council to answer as the representative of the school committee in our last meeting, we just made that clear.

543
00:43:27,698 --> 00:43:29,098
[SPEAKER_07]: That is not acceptable either.

544
00:43:29,778 --> 00:43:42,622
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know what the process is now, but ignoring the city council, which I think we should respect them and as another body in our city, they deserve our respect, but we have no process for how to respond to them.

545
00:43:43,699 --> 00:43:46,220
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's all I'm trying to lay out here is some process.

546
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,280
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be any process.

547
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:49,540
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't have to be using our format.

548
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:53,661
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be somebody, the president of the council, the city clerk.

549
00:43:53,721 --> 00:43:58,423
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care who sends an email to the superintendent and asks that it be added to the agenda.

550
00:43:59,483 --> 00:44:02,243
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have any preferences at all in that.

551
00:44:02,323 --> 00:44:05,484
[SPEAKER_07]: This was just my first thought is that we already have a process.

552
00:44:05,524 --> 00:44:07,565
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not that complicated.

553
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:08,525
[SPEAKER_07]: So why not use it?

554
00:44:08,965 --> 00:44:10,465
[SPEAKER_07]: But it doesn't have to be that.

555
00:44:10,845 --> 00:44:13,126
[SPEAKER_07]: As for the part about the superintendent,

556
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:16,627
[SPEAKER_07]: being called to the city council.

557
00:44:17,527 --> 00:44:33,311
[SPEAKER_07]: We have an org chart on page, I think, two or three of our budget every single year, going back to at least 1997, that says the organization of our government, the superintendent has no line in any way, shape or form with the city council.

558
00:44:33,391 --> 00:44:36,732
[SPEAKER_07]: When the city council beckons a superintendent, she should not jump.

559
00:44:38,195 --> 00:44:42,056
[SPEAKER_07]: there is absolutely no relationship between the superintendent and the city council.

560
00:44:42,636 --> 00:44:46,277
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's not fair to the superintendent.

561
00:44:46,317 --> 00:44:51,119
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, what if we had a city council that expected the superintendent at every meeting to answer questions?

562
00:44:51,539 --> 00:44:54,960
[SPEAKER_07]: So now Monday nights are school committee and Tuesday nights are city council meetings.

563
00:44:57,401 --> 00:45:07,604
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to make it crystal clear that if the city council wants to talk to the superintendent, we have to give permission for that to happen because that's actually the facts.

564
00:45:08,877 --> 00:45:09,698
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a fact.

565
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:14,702
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not really a discussion point, it's a fact.

566
00:45:15,582 --> 00:45:27,251
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it might be collegial and nice if the superintendent just shows up whenever they ask, but there's only so many hours in the day the superintendent works for this body.

567
00:45:28,172 --> 00:45:35,658
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that expecting the superintendent to report to two public bodies is just highly inappropriate.

568
00:45:35,798 --> 00:45:37,479
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why I wrote this rule.

569
00:45:38,968 --> 00:45:39,990
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I can say so far.

570
00:45:43,154 --> 00:45:43,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Member.

571
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:44,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Dr. Edouard-Vincent.

572
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:50,465
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I actually feel like

573
00:45:54,488 --> 00:46:09,214
[SPEAKER_00]: In my short time in this role, the four years that I've been in Medford, I have never had a situation where the Medford city council, you know, was calling me on like a weekly basis.

574
00:46:10,034 --> 00:46:14,576
[SPEAKER_00]: Really the majority of my interaction with the city council would be at the end of the budget season.

575
00:46:16,537 --> 00:46:17,878
[SPEAKER_00]: The requests that have been made,

576
00:46:18,958 --> 00:46:25,500
[SPEAKER_00]: over the past few years have been really reasonable requests or maybe an inquiry.

577
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:38,502
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been nothing, like I don't want it to, I don't want to present that, you know, I'm, my inbox is being flooded by council members.

578
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:45,004
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's a very, you know, simple inquiry or a quick question, maybe a constituent,

579
00:46:45,684 --> 00:46:49,388
[SPEAKER_00]: may have asked them a question and they just said let me just reach out to the schools.

580
00:46:50,009 --> 00:47:00,139
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's something that is so rare that I don't feel like number 77 is really necessary.

581
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:03,482
[SPEAKER_00]: The add item to agenda, it's

582
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:17,398
[SPEAKER_00]: over the past, it's even hard to recall what some of the requests were because they were usually a very reasonable ask and it is not something that they are asking on a weekly basis.

583
00:47:17,458 --> 00:47:28,066
[SPEAKER_00]: It could just be, you know, can you provide a little clarity, you know, on a particular thing, maybe something in the vocational school or wondering that they were just wondering about.

584
00:47:28,086 --> 00:47:32,349
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so rare that I almost feel like

585
00:47:33,451 --> 00:47:39,357
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting this in insinuates that there is a problem.

586
00:47:39,877 --> 00:47:41,319
[SPEAKER_00]: I deal with the clerk's office.

587
00:47:43,141 --> 00:47:47,125
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time we have a meeting, we send our communications to the clerk.

588
00:47:47,885 --> 00:47:52,890
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has always been responsive to posting and those kinds of things.

589
00:47:55,412 --> 00:48:05,281
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never, you know, had something asked of me by the city council that would, you know, be a cause for alarm.

590
00:48:05,881 --> 00:48:12,207
[SPEAKER_00]: And if something like that were to occur I definitely would notify the membership, this body immediately.

591
00:48:15,297 --> 00:48:18,919
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that it's necessary.

592
00:48:18,939 --> 00:48:27,424
[SPEAKER_00]: If there was a difficult request, I would definitely make sure that we added it to the agenda.

593
00:48:28,224 --> 00:48:38,890
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually when we do receive a request from the city council, it comes from the mayor's office.

594
00:48:39,311 --> 00:48:43,713
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some kind of communication of this is a wondering or an inquiry.

595
00:48:44,218 --> 00:48:45,659
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is so rare.

596
00:48:45,679 --> 00:48:52,001
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't even think in the past four years, there probably weren't even 10 questions in four years.

597
00:48:52,422 --> 00:48:55,103
[SPEAKER_00]: I think fewer than 10, maybe five or six.

598
00:48:55,743 --> 00:48:56,543
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very rare.

599
00:48:59,485 --> 00:49:01,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

600
00:49:02,346 --> 00:49:04,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham, Member Kreatz, Member Ruseau.

601
00:49:05,887 --> 00:49:06,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

602
00:49:08,416 --> 00:49:37,776
[SPEAKER_11]: My understanding of this motion is not that the council would have to do this if they had a harmless question, but when they take the time to talk about something on the floor and take a vote on something that pertains to schools, or like, we're gonna ask the school committee something, or we're gonna ask the superintendent something, when they've taken the time in their meeting to weigh in in a majority way,

603
00:49:38,366 --> 00:49:42,292
[SPEAKER_11]: On something I do believe that should come through the school committee.

604
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:54,609
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think we have a process today, which is why it doesn't and i'm glad that it really hasn't become an issue, but I just want to point out where we're headed towards some very.

605
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:11,407
[SPEAKER_11]: interesting discussions as we talk about the high school complex, as we talk about ARPA funds, as we talk about funding for our schools, as we talk about all the things that we know are coming.

606
00:50:12,367 --> 00:50:24,293
[SPEAKER_11]: And I am a proponent of having process that is not onerous, but establishes good habits in times when it's easy to have good habits.

607
00:50:24,817 --> 00:50:33,863
[SPEAKER_11]: If this comes to blows about the high school, that is not going to be the time for us to be establishing process.

608
00:50:33,923 --> 00:50:41,668
[SPEAKER_11]: So I am a proponent of having a way for this to happen in a consistent and rational manner.

609
00:50:41,688 --> 00:50:50,774
[SPEAKER_11]: And the last thing I'll say is that we get a lot of pushback from the administration, rightfully so, when we ask for things because there is not enough capacity

610
00:50:52,275 --> 00:50:55,477
[SPEAKER_11]: to do whatever the thing is that we might be asking.

611
00:50:56,018 --> 00:51:02,063
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's reasonable to think that some of these things from the council could over time take time.

612
00:51:02,843 --> 00:51:14,693
[SPEAKER_11]: And if they're gonna take time, this body needs to decide whether the thing the council voted on on Tuesday night is more or less important than the thing that is in front of us the following Monday night.

613
00:51:14,793 --> 00:51:18,396
[SPEAKER_11]: So from a prioritization perspective,

614
00:51:19,289 --> 00:51:30,712
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's really important for us to have process around this and a structure that allows us as a body to consider all the things we have to consider, which in fairness, the council couldn't know about.

615
00:51:30,772 --> 00:51:42,135
[SPEAKER_11]: Like the council has no idea and shouldn't be expected to know about all the things that we contend with in terms of all the very real resource contention we have in our own district.

616
00:51:43,675 --> 00:51:46,776
[SPEAKER_11]: So expecting them to be able to weigh that when they make

617
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:59,883
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, when they take the time to have a vote, I think is unreasonable and putting this in place would allow us to have a good open line of communication and to do so not at the expense of the administration.

618
00:51:59,903 --> 00:52:01,745
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

619
00:52:03,046 --> 00:52:06,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, member Graham, member Cress, member Rousseau, member McLaughlin.

620
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:14,918
[SPEAKER_08]: I will wait to hear from Member Ruseau and Member McLaughlin before I go.

621
00:52:14,938 --> 00:52:21,040
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to hear what everybody's thinking, and then I'll go at the end.

622
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:22,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

623
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau, then Member McLaughlin, then Member Kreatz.

624
00:52:25,741 --> 00:52:27,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mayor.

625
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:32,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Superintendent said something really important that I want to highlight.

626
00:52:33,415 --> 00:52:39,818
[SPEAKER_07]: The individual Councilors emailing the superintendent to ask a question is absolutely not what this is about.

627
00:52:41,099 --> 00:52:45,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like with school committee members, individual Councilors have no authority.

628
00:52:47,102 --> 00:52:56,927
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they email the superintendent and ask a question and the superintendent responds, they're a member of the public asking a question and that's fine.

629
00:52:57,587 --> 00:53:03,090
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm talking about when there are votes happening and they are, you know, if they,

630
00:53:04,165 --> 00:53:10,850
[SPEAKER_07]: As member Graham mentioned, we have big expensive things coming up in conversations around our schools.

631
00:53:11,451 --> 00:53:22,220
[SPEAKER_07]: And it is both, I expect, and it would be surprised if the council does not have questions, big questions, report size questions, go do some analysis questions.

632
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:27,045
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, these are big expensive things that they have to consider if

633
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:30,012
[SPEAKER_07]: if there's going to be a debt exclusion or something like that.

634
00:53:30,092 --> 00:53:49,039
[SPEAKER_07]: So I expect them to be doing this and for them to have, you know, a direct line to the superintendent when it is, I mean, and I know that the superintendent said, you know, if they ask for something big, then obviously she'll not necessarily push back, but she'll seek the guidance of the committee on an agenda.

635
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:52,760
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that having a process ahead of time is also good because

636
00:53:53,388 --> 00:53:58,389
[SPEAKER_07]: then it doesn't look like we have gotten sick of all these requests from the council and we're pushing back.

637
00:53:58,649 --> 00:54:00,250
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not the goal of this at all.

638
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:15,354
[SPEAKER_07]: I would agree that in my, this is my fifth year now, it's not been a problem, but I expect it will become not a problem, but something that will happen as we deal with ARPA and perhaps a new high school.

639
00:54:16,174 --> 00:54:19,935
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is definitely just about when the body takes the time to take a vote,

640
00:54:21,875 --> 00:54:23,635
[SPEAKER_07]: what happens to that communication?

641
00:54:23,675 --> 00:54:32,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I think there have been at least two instances where the body took a vote asking for something, I think from the school committee and nobody knew what to do with it.

642
00:54:33,717 --> 00:54:36,358
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, how do we respond?

643
00:54:36,418 --> 00:54:41,799
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't even think we even have a rule in there, maybe we do, about how do we respond?

644
00:54:42,499 --> 00:54:46,240
[SPEAKER_07]: What do we do with a response to the city council if we have a response?

645
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:48,480
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

646
00:54:49,501 --> 00:54:51,541
[SPEAKER_07]: We vote and hope they watch the meeting on Monday night

647
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:57,890
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not a real line of communication, but that's a different rule probably.

648
00:54:58,671 --> 00:55:00,294
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's all I have to say on this.

649
00:55:00,314 --> 00:55:03,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

650
00:55:07,075 --> 00:55:17,380
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, I appreciate the policy in expanding on communication between the school committee and Medford City Council.

651
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:29,566
[SPEAKER_12]: So if they are voting on something regarding the schools, it is really important and great for us to know that that's been voted on and that be sent to us and added to an agenda item so that we're aware of that.

652
00:55:29,586 --> 00:55:34,288
[SPEAKER_12]: So the first half of the motion makes a lot of sense to me.

653
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:40,370
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the second half, after some of our colleagues explanation makes more sense than it did in the initial read.

654
00:55:42,091 --> 00:55:45,372
[SPEAKER_12]: Because you were talking about City Council obviously as a body.

655
00:55:47,473 --> 00:55:53,676
[SPEAKER_12]: So, referring the request to the superintendent for a more majority vote is fine.

656
00:55:53,996 --> 00:56:02,879
[SPEAKER_12]: The superintendent is not authorized to respond to City Council request to attend City Council meeting or perform any actions requested by the City Council without a majority vote of the school committee.

657
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:03,860
[SPEAKER_12]: I think

658
00:56:05,411 --> 00:56:21,503
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I'm behind that, that sentence, I think that what's maybe problematic for some people is the strong wording around not authorized and I just don't know what if there's a way to wordsmith this that is a little bit more collegial, as folks were saying.

659
00:56:22,343 --> 00:56:27,007
[SPEAKER_12]: So maybe it is the superintendent is, you know, permitted to respond to city council request.

660
00:56:27,468 --> 00:56:34,134
[SPEAKER_12]: to attend school committee, city council meetings, perform any actions requested by the city council with a majority vote of the school committee.

661
00:56:34,174 --> 00:56:43,381
[SPEAKER_12]: So just flipping the language, so losing not authorized and without, and making it more strength-based language is what I would suggest as a friendly amendment.

662
00:56:48,366 --> 00:56:50,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, member McLaughlin.

663
00:56:50,267 --> 00:56:50,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Kreatz?

664
00:56:52,377 --> 00:56:59,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, so I still have some concerns about both parts of the way that this is written.

665
00:57:00,081 --> 00:57:05,084
[SPEAKER_08]: And let me just, I'm sorry because I when I do click off I have to get back to it one moment I'm going to get back to it.

666
00:57:05,584 --> 00:57:07,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, it's over here now one second.

667
00:57:07,785 --> 00:57:08,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

668
00:57:09,646 --> 00:57:10,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, okay, so.

669
00:57:11,957 --> 00:57:16,040
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been listening to everybody, and I was thinking about the first part of it.

670
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,202
[SPEAKER_08]: And I, this is just what I'm thinking.

671
00:57:20,883 --> 00:57:23,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we could change it to say something like this.

672
00:57:23,865 --> 00:57:34,573
[SPEAKER_08]: All motions passed by member city council that pertain to the member public schools will be sent by the president of the council to the school committee chair to, to be reviewed as an agenda

673
00:57:35,213 --> 00:57:44,718
[SPEAKER_08]: to review it as an agenda item seeking guidance from the committee in accordance with the school committee procedure and timing as found the addendum, you know, add item to agenda.

674
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:49,501
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's something that the superintendent would then make that determination.

675
00:57:49,741 --> 00:57:56,725
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the mayor would then maybe forward it on to the superintendent and she can make the determination on, okay, let's get this added on the agenda.

676
00:57:56,865 --> 00:57:58,806
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanna seek the guidance from the school committee.

677
00:57:59,526 --> 00:58:06,195
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, and that, you know, we would have some sort of a process where you're thinking about in the future we're going to have a lot of requests, maybe.

678
00:58:06,776 --> 00:58:10,781
[SPEAKER_08]: So that could be part of it, you know, just a simpler plan for the rule.

679
00:58:11,642 --> 00:58:15,588
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, you know, the second part.

680
00:58:17,662 --> 00:58:24,166
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I just, I don't understand why we have to include the majority vote of the school committee.

681
00:58:24,527 --> 00:58:38,296
[SPEAKER_08]: So if the superintendent receives a simple email, you know, oh, I just wanted to know, just checking in, you know, the vocational program is having, you know, this particular new equipment, you know, oh, did that get purchased, you know, something like that, just something simple.

682
00:58:39,897 --> 00:58:50,266
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel as though she gets the email, she should be able to email back the city council without putting that on the agenda, so that we can take a full boat at the next school committee.

683
00:58:50,706 --> 00:59:00,254
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm just thinking of it, just keeping it try to keep it a little simpler, where we just say, the superintendent is permitted to respond to, you know,

684
00:59:01,315 --> 00:59:19,763
[SPEAKER_08]: reasonable, I'm sorry, to city council reasonable requests to attend city council meetings or perform actions requested by the city council, you know, within reason, you know, and it's, you know, it might need a school, but it depends on like what the request is.

685
00:59:19,823 --> 00:59:24,485
[SPEAKER_08]: It might be something that has to go on the agenda that we all have to make a vote on.

686
00:59:24,945 --> 00:59:29,167
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, I think that the way that it's written right now, it's just,

687
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:33,109
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just too restrictive.

688
00:59:34,069 --> 00:59:42,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though I've heard from everybody and I still feel that it does insinuate that we are having problems with the city council and we are not.

689
00:59:43,695 --> 00:59:54,261
[SPEAKER_08]: And I do think maybe in the future with a lot of things going on, with upgrades to the high school and body cameras on police officers, yes, we might have some requests but

690
00:59:55,501 --> 00:59:57,562
[SPEAKER_08]: As the superintendent mentioned, it's very rare.

691
00:59:57,582 --> 01:00:06,725
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, I just think getting it on the agenda, you know, would be the best way to do it if it comes through from the city council president.

692
01:00:07,345 --> 01:00:16,528
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm just trying to really just simplify this rule and just, you know, kind of just make it a little bit simpler and friendlier.

693
01:00:18,267 --> 01:00:19,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Member Kreatz.

694
01:00:19,647 --> 01:00:38,894
[SPEAKER_05]: And the way it works is the city council will vote on it and the clerk will send it to my office and then I send it off to the superintendent and my office did CC the school committee, especially if the language says, you know, the school committee specifically and not the superintendent, just to make you all aware.

695
01:00:39,454 --> 01:00:45,216
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would, you know, compromise with something like that, that if we feel then

696
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:48,984
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a serious issue than it goes before the school committee for a vote.

697
01:00:49,084 --> 01:01:03,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, I think you got to let the superintendent to respond to requests and questions that the city council has without having to bring every single item for a vote on the school committee nights.

698
01:01:04,434 --> 01:01:05,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Just my opinion.

699
01:01:05,735 --> 01:01:11,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham, then member Ruseau.

700
01:01:17,209 --> 01:01:30,484
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to sort of reframe the reason we're talking about having rules, and it has nothing to do with a response particularly to something happening or it's no implication of anything in this moment.

701
01:01:31,185 --> 01:01:39,250
[SPEAKER_11]: it's instead our collective desire to say we want to have rules so that we can operate effectively and avoid issues in the future.

702
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:45,473
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just don't want the narrative of this discussion to be somebody thinks we have a problem.

703
01:01:45,673 --> 01:01:54,939
[SPEAKER_11]: Like sometimes that's how a rule gets created, but the whole point of this document being somewhat disconnected from any particular controversy or controversial issue

704
01:01:56,259 --> 01:02:04,085
[SPEAKER_11]: is so that when those controversial issues come up, we can operate against something consistent that we've all agreed on when we're not in the middle of a controversy.

705
01:02:05,727 --> 01:02:12,512
[SPEAKER_11]: Having said that, Cathy, I have no idea what your proposal is in terms of the amendment, so I'm not clear what you're asking us to vote on.

706
01:02:13,209 --> 01:02:16,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and I'm trying to word it, I'm sorry.

707
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:18,432
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm working on it right now, Ms.

708
01:02:18,452 --> 01:02:19,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Graham, sorry.

709
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:23,955
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to put it all together with what the mayor just mentioned.

710
01:02:25,156 --> 01:02:28,397
[SPEAKER_08]: So let me just reflect on what the mayor just mentioned.

711
01:02:28,457 --> 01:02:32,500
[SPEAKER_08]: She mentioned that the current process, and I'm just trying to go through what she just said.

712
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:37,923
[SPEAKER_08]: The current process is that she will, if something was voted on the floor,

713
01:02:39,074 --> 01:02:41,335
[SPEAKER_08]: So let me just get this going.

714
01:02:41,455 --> 01:02:41,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

715
01:02:42,115 --> 01:02:42,435
[SPEAKER_08]: So.

716
01:02:43,315 --> 01:03:01,940
[SPEAKER_08]: All motions passed by Medford city council that pertain to Medford public schools will be sent by city council president or city clerk to the school committee chair to be put on the, the agenda.

717
01:03:03,577 --> 01:03:08,739
[SPEAKER_08]: in accordance with the procedure that we have in place.

718
01:03:14,521 --> 01:03:21,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Based on the chair and the superintendent's review, they decide whether it should be placed in the agenda.

719
01:03:21,524 --> 01:03:22,844
[SPEAKER_05]: This can get really out of hand.

720
01:03:22,864 --> 01:03:29,727
[SPEAKER_05]: The school city council says, I want a copy of the report that was given on Monday night, February 2nd.

721
01:03:31,144 --> 01:03:36,388
[SPEAKER_05]: okay, it's public record, it's probably on the website, but we'll give you, we'll shoot it to you by email.

722
01:03:36,608 --> 01:03:48,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Should that have to go on the next school committee agenda to be discussed on whether or not the superintendent should be allowed to provide them an email, the clerk an email to say, here's the report that was discussed on February 2nd.

723
01:03:49,237 --> 01:03:52,319
[SPEAKER_05]: It will get so cumbersome, our six to 10 p.m.

724
01:03:52,359 --> 01:03:57,303
[SPEAKER_05]: meetings could turn into far lengthier, and I just think

725
01:03:57,713 --> 01:04:04,178
[SPEAKER_05]: the superintendent should have the authority to, she knows very well when to loop the school committee in.

726
01:04:04,238 --> 01:04:06,660
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's just constant emails and updates.

727
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:17,848
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's been working pretty well, but we can always put something in that says the chair and the superintendent believe that it's questionable.

728
01:04:18,508 --> 01:04:23,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's put it on a school committee meeting and let the committee vote on how they'd like us to respond to the council.

729
01:04:24,922 --> 01:04:35,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, yes, thank you and I can just re reword it because I'm just doing this just from all the conversation and I'm trying the best here so okay so let me just see if I have this right here.

730
01:04:35,866 --> 01:04:49,452
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I would make a motion to change number 77 to say all motions passed by the member city council that pertain to me for public schools will be sent by city council president to the school committee chair to be reviewed

731
01:04:51,466 --> 01:04:54,808
[SPEAKER_08]: whether or not it should be added as an agenda item.

732
01:04:56,528 --> 01:04:58,950
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sorry, I'm just losing you because I wrote it down.

733
01:04:59,890 --> 01:05:01,951
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's as far as I've retained.

734
01:05:01,971 --> 01:05:05,593
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just my opinion, but I know.

735
01:05:05,793 --> 01:05:06,713
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree.

736
01:05:06,753 --> 01:05:11,996
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the way that it's working right now is working, but we don't have it documented.

737
01:05:12,356 --> 01:05:13,717
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm trying to get

738
01:05:14,637 --> 01:05:21,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Number 77 recorded the way it's working now, exactly the way it's working now.

739
01:05:21,782 --> 01:05:23,143
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I'm trying to do.

740
01:05:23,184 --> 01:05:26,306
[SPEAKER_03]: From the city clerk to my office to the superintendent.

741
01:05:27,407 --> 01:05:27,727
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

742
01:05:27,987 --> 01:05:41,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, just simple, you know, and, and then like all this, all these rules, if we're having issues with any one of them at any point in the future, as we said already, we can bring this up on a regular school committee.

743
01:05:41,131 --> 01:05:42,012
[SPEAKER_08]: We'd like to change this.

744
01:05:42,212 --> 01:05:45,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Something's not working, but we have to start with something.

745
01:05:45,253 --> 01:05:46,893
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's start with what we're doing right now.

746
01:05:49,794 --> 01:05:51,034
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's my motion.

747
01:05:51,295 --> 01:05:52,655
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope everybody got that.

748
01:05:53,575 --> 01:05:53,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

749
01:05:53,915 --> 01:05:55,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau, then member Graham.

750
01:05:56,631 --> 01:05:56,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

751
01:05:57,392 --> 01:06:00,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Cress just made a point that I think is really important.

752
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:05,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody here knew what the process was, but apparently the mayor and the superintendent.

753
01:06:06,138 --> 01:06:09,881
[SPEAKER_07]: The point of the rules document is that we are all equal on this board.

754
01:06:11,823 --> 01:06:13,104
[SPEAKER_07]: None of us knew what the process was.

755
01:06:14,265 --> 01:06:23,252
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's fascinating that we're putting all kinds of trust in the process and nobody knew what it was, but the mayor.

756
01:06:24,813 --> 01:06:26,974
[SPEAKER_07]: That seems kind of hard to wrap my head around.

757
01:06:29,194 --> 01:06:35,116
[SPEAKER_07]: I also don't think we can pass a rule that tells the city council president what she will do.

758
01:06:36,156 --> 01:06:40,097
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't think we can specify that the city council president will do something.

759
01:06:41,697 --> 01:06:49,499
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that part of that motion doesn't make sense to me because we don't have the authority to tell the city council president what to do.

760
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,540
[SPEAKER_07]: I suppose you could say that the city clerk

761
01:06:53,463 --> 01:06:55,144
[SPEAKER_07]: We also can't tell the city clerk what to do.

762
01:06:55,364 --> 01:07:03,266
[SPEAKER_07]: However, the city clerk is an employee and is the person who manages motions that are passed by the council.

763
01:07:03,346 --> 01:07:07,668
[SPEAKER_07]: So that person certainly seems the obvious natural one.

764
01:07:08,088 --> 01:07:16,831
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess we could also have the rule say that a member of administration will watch all city council meetings and respond appropriately if they come up, but that would be horrible and burdensome.

765
01:07:17,672 --> 01:07:18,872
[SPEAKER_07]: We did have a motion earlier

766
01:07:19,473 --> 01:07:28,696
[SPEAKER_07]: to change the language to be strength-based, to remove the not authorized and make it authorized and change the without a majority vote to just with a majority vote.

767
01:07:29,477 --> 01:07:38,300
[SPEAKER_07]: I would second that before we start going into the three or four amendments and changes we've gotten into.

768
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,761
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know if there's interest in a roll call on that.

769
01:07:45,102 --> 01:07:46,563
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd be happy to take a roll call on that.

770
01:07:48,768 --> 01:07:53,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that was Member McLaughlin's motion, seconded by Member Ruseau.

771
01:07:56,491 --> 01:07:56,971
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Graham?

772
01:07:57,591 --> 01:07:57,811
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

773
01:07:59,632 --> 01:08:00,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Kreatz?

774
01:08:01,052 --> 01:08:01,312
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

775
01:08:03,433 --> 01:08:04,954
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Hays?

776
01:08:05,974 --> 01:08:06,214
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

777
01:08:09,135 --> 01:08:09,875
[SPEAKER_01]: Member McLaughlin?

778
01:08:10,916 --> 01:08:11,256
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

779
01:08:12,156 --> 01:08:12,856
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Mustone?

780
01:08:13,557 --> 01:08:13,837
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

781
01:08:15,477 --> 01:08:16,157
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Ruseau?

782
01:08:16,177 --> 01:08:16,398
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

783
01:08:20,707 --> 01:08:22,067
[SPEAKER_05]: for that change in that sentence?

784
01:08:22,728 --> 01:08:23,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

785
01:08:27,809 --> 01:08:29,830
[SPEAKER_08]: What did member Kreatz say?

786
01:08:29,850 --> 01:08:29,890
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

787
01:08:32,611 --> 01:08:33,992
[SPEAKER_08]: No, okay.

788
01:08:40,054 --> 01:08:46,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I just said no because I would just like to strike that whole section, that whole sentence.

789
01:08:46,496 --> 01:08:49,077
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm just not in agreement with that sentence.

790
01:08:50,028 --> 01:08:51,109
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why I'm no.

791
01:08:55,613 --> 01:08:57,855
[SPEAKER_05]: So is there a motion on the floor to strike the sentence?

792
01:09:01,317 --> 01:09:03,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, motion on the floor to strike the sentence.

793
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:15,609
[SPEAKER_08]: The entire last sentence, the superintendent is not authorized to respond to city council requests, attend school committee meeting, city council meetings, or perform any actions requested by the city council without a majority vote at the school committee.

794
01:09:17,931 --> 01:09:18,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a second?

795
01:09:23,531 --> 01:09:24,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, no second.

796
01:09:24,892 --> 01:09:30,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham, Member Ruseau.

797
01:09:31,095 --> 01:09:46,204
[SPEAKER_11]: So as it relates to the beginning part of this, I think what might make sense is to amend the language to say that the council, generically, will pass,

798
01:09:48,362 --> 01:09:54,345
[SPEAKER_11]: information about requests passed by the council to the mayor and the superintendent.

799
01:09:55,905 --> 01:10:04,950
[SPEAKER_11]: If the request can be answered with information that is publicly available, the superintendent will do so.

800
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:14,474
[SPEAKER_11]: If the request requires additional effort on behalf of the district or administration, it'll be placed on our agenda.

801
01:10:16,087 --> 01:10:19,732
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's a matter of public record, to me, that is not what we're talking about.

802
01:10:19,892 --> 01:10:28,424
[SPEAKER_11]: If there's a report that exists that's already in the public domain, then we're not talking about that coming to us.

803
01:10:29,466 --> 01:10:29,926
[SPEAKER_11]: ahead of time.

804
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:38,628
[SPEAKER_11]: I think what we're saying is if you're going to expend energy, effort, time, money, creating something to respond to an inquiry, those are the things that we want to see.

805
01:10:38,708 --> 01:10:40,749
[SPEAKER_11]: At least that is how I am interpreting this.

806
01:10:40,849 --> 01:10:45,110
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not to say we're going to gatekeep publicly available information.

807
01:10:45,610 --> 01:10:47,650
[SPEAKER_11]: That would just be a giant waste of time that nobody has.

808
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:50,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was just using that as an example.

809
01:10:50,231 --> 01:10:57,333
[SPEAKER_05]: But if it's an easy information or answer, then I don't think it needs to go on the agenda.

810
01:10:57,373 --> 01:10:59,333
[SPEAKER_05]: But maybe we can just spell that out.

811
01:10:59,810 --> 01:11:01,991
[SPEAKER_05]: time, energy, and man hours.

812
01:11:02,071 --> 01:11:08,514
[SPEAKER_11]: I think if it's publicly available information, I think that's the answer, right?

813
01:11:17,058 --> 01:11:17,719
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Kreatz.

814
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:20,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

815
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:25,382
[SPEAKER_08]: So I still have the motion on the floor for the beginning part of the

816
01:11:26,999 --> 01:11:31,382
[SPEAKER_08]: The rule, the way that I had, you know, read that out.

817
01:11:31,462 --> 01:11:33,083
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm not sure.

818
01:11:33,103 --> 01:11:34,444
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember.

819
01:11:34,824 --> 01:11:39,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Did I have a second by anybody on the way that I had worded it?

820
01:11:43,569 --> 01:11:44,370
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you say it again?

821
01:11:45,290 --> 01:11:45,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

822
01:11:48,192 --> 01:11:48,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Um,

823
01:11:51,887 --> 01:11:53,287
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just looking at it right now.

824
01:11:53,487 --> 01:11:56,088
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I erased a word, but I was making changes.

825
01:11:56,168 --> 01:11:56,408
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

826
01:11:56,428 --> 01:11:59,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, shoot.

827
01:11:59,089 --> 01:11:59,709
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I did.

828
01:11:59,749 --> 01:12:00,069
[SPEAKER_08]: One second.

829
01:12:00,089 --> 01:12:01,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me just grab this for a second.

830
01:12:01,309 --> 01:12:05,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Because when I was typing, I actually think I erased some words.

831
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:06,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, gosh.

832
01:12:07,291 --> 01:12:07,791
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me see number 77.

833
01:12:07,871 --> 01:12:09,631
[SPEAKER_08]: It's right in front of the paper.

834
01:12:09,651 --> 01:12:09,691
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

835
01:12:10,171 --> 01:12:12,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

836
01:12:22,501 --> 01:12:24,983
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so this is what I had originally said.

837
01:12:26,564 --> 01:12:47,902
[SPEAKER_08]: All requests passed by Medford City Council that pertain to Medford Public Schools will be sent to the school committee chair and will be reviewed with the superintendent to determine if it can be answered or needs to be added to the agenda.

838
01:12:57,244 --> 01:12:58,625
[SPEAKER_08]: And yes.

839
01:12:59,765 --> 01:13:01,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you put that in the chat for me?

840
01:13:01,386 --> 01:13:01,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

841
01:13:01,646 --> 01:13:02,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me do that.

842
01:13:02,327 --> 01:13:02,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

843
01:13:02,607 --> 01:13:04,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I, let me get there.

844
01:13:04,548 --> 01:13:04,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

845
01:13:04,748 --> 01:13:05,708
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna do that right now.

846
01:13:06,829 --> 01:13:08,930
[SPEAKER_08]: Just looking around.

847
01:13:08,990 --> 01:13:09,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, there it is.

848
01:13:09,550 --> 01:13:09,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

849
01:13:09,670 --> 01:13:10,691
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

850
01:13:10,971 --> 01:13:12,351
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me just go here.

851
01:13:14,653 --> 01:13:23,837
[SPEAKER_11]: And member Kreatz, perhaps we could say if it can be answered with publicly available information and that just sort of provides that end cap to the conversation we were just having.

852
01:13:26,522 --> 01:13:27,862
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that sounds fine.

853
01:13:28,183 --> 01:13:31,684
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just going to go get the language again.

854
01:13:32,364 --> 01:13:34,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead of typing, I'm going to try to copy and paste it.

855
01:13:34,965 --> 01:13:35,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

856
01:13:37,386 --> 01:13:45,408
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me just get this one.

857
01:13:48,847 --> 01:13:49,687
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just going to be typing.

858
01:13:49,727 --> 01:13:50,347
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, guys.

859
01:13:50,828 --> 01:13:55,789
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually did remove a sentence from the original document on my Google Drive.

860
01:13:56,929 --> 01:13:57,969
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've got to retype it.

861
01:13:57,989 --> 01:14:15,294
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm getting there.

862
01:14:20,512 --> 01:14:21,153
[SPEAKER_13]: will be seen.

863
01:14:31,864 --> 01:14:33,065
[SPEAKER_13]: It will be viewed.

864
01:14:52,696 --> 01:15:01,343
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I've got it.

865
01:15:23,575 --> 01:15:24,135
[SPEAKER_08]: And Ms.

866
01:15:24,155 --> 01:15:26,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Graham, if you want to, I'm putting it in the chat now.

867
01:15:26,716 --> 01:15:28,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me just get back to the chat.

868
01:15:30,857 --> 01:15:31,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Getting a little twisted.

869
01:15:32,277 --> 01:15:32,897
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, gosh.

870
01:15:33,458 --> 01:15:34,458
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't lose everybody.

871
01:15:34,478 --> 01:15:35,198
[SPEAKER_13]: One second.

872
01:15:36,058 --> 01:15:36,858
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, Zoom.

873
01:15:37,659 --> 01:15:38,559
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, there it is.

874
01:15:38,579 --> 01:15:43,540
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see.

875
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:44,440
[SPEAKER_13]: Got it.

876
01:15:48,241 --> 01:15:48,561
[SPEAKER_13]: And OK.

877
01:15:52,685 --> 01:15:56,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I don't know if you can see it, because when I see it, I can see it.

878
01:15:57,087 --> 01:15:59,808
[SPEAKER_08]: You can in normal, like it's not all crazy.

879
01:15:59,868 --> 01:16:00,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

880
01:16:00,628 --> 01:16:02,469
[SPEAKER_08]: The way it shows for me, it's giant.

881
01:16:02,509 --> 01:16:04,070
[SPEAKER_08]: So, all right.

882
01:16:04,410 --> 01:16:11,573
[SPEAKER_08]: So, if you want to copy and paste and then put the portion that you were talking about, Ms.

883
01:16:11,593 --> 01:16:15,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Graham, where that would fit.

884
01:16:24,553 --> 01:16:24,853
[SPEAKER_01]: You go.

885
01:16:43,182 --> 01:16:43,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor.

886
01:16:44,422 --> 01:16:44,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

887
01:16:44,582 --> 01:16:46,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau.

888
01:16:47,327 --> 01:16:50,328
[SPEAKER_07]: And just to make sure I am writing down exactly this correctly.

889
01:16:50,368 --> 01:17:05,673
[SPEAKER_07]: So this would replace the beginning where it starts with all and continue all the way through till really until we can just get rid of that how to add items to the agenda section.

890
01:17:05,813 --> 01:17:09,834
[SPEAKER_07]: So right up until the sentence, the school committee may refer such requests.

891
01:17:11,915 --> 01:17:15,196
[SPEAKER_07]: No, actually that sentence seems like that needs to go as well, right?

892
01:17:17,102 --> 01:17:21,063
[SPEAKER_07]: So this would be replacing everything up to that last sentence.

893
01:17:21,583 --> 01:17:22,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Last sentence, yes.

894
01:17:22,823 --> 01:17:28,425
[SPEAKER_08]: And by the way, I just did my grammar check and I made some changes.

895
01:17:28,565 --> 01:17:30,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Grammarly told me to make some changes.

896
01:17:30,445 --> 01:17:34,386
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just repasted it with the grammar, correct grammar, sorry.

897
01:17:34,846 --> 01:17:41,528
[SPEAKER_08]: So take a look at the new little post that I just did in the chat because I have my grammar check in another area.

898
01:17:41,548 --> 01:17:45,449
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I'm gonna re-add this piece.

899
01:17:46,089 --> 01:17:46,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, sorry.

900
01:17:55,722 --> 01:17:59,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's kind of funny, this would actually be much harder in person than it is on Zoom.

901
01:18:01,805 --> 01:18:09,148
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

902
01:18:18,613 --> 01:18:23,795
[SPEAKER_08]: So do I have a second on the motion, the way that it's prepared and checked?

903
01:18:26,947 --> 01:18:28,487
[SPEAKER_11]: As amended by me, Member Kreatz?

904
01:18:28,767 --> 01:18:29,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, as amended by Ms.

905
01:18:29,908 --> 01:18:30,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Graham.

906
01:18:30,728 --> 01:18:31,128
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

907
01:18:33,308 --> 01:18:35,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion for approval, seconded by Member Graham.

908
01:18:35,789 --> 01:18:36,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call, please.

909
01:18:40,970 --> 01:18:41,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Graham?

910
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:42,610
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

911
01:18:43,671 --> 01:18:44,151
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Kreatz?

912
01:18:44,631 --> 01:18:44,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

913
01:18:45,951 --> 01:18:46,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Hays?

914
01:18:47,591 --> 01:18:47,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

915
01:18:48,872 --> 01:18:49,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Member McLaughlin?

916
01:18:50,812 --> 01:18:51,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

917
01:18:52,172 --> 01:18:52,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Mustone?

918
01:18:53,573 --> 01:18:53,873
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

919
01:18:54,633 --> 01:18:55,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau?

920
01:18:57,066 --> 01:18:59,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I'm waiting for something.

921
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:00,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor Longo, correct.

922
01:19:01,408 --> 01:19:04,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative, paper passes.

923
01:19:05,190 --> 01:19:10,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any questions on 79 through 90?

924
01:19:14,455 --> 01:19:19,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Secretary, duties of the superintendent seem pretty clear.

925
01:19:22,199 --> 01:19:23,759
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just gonna go into my notes again.

926
01:19:25,358 --> 01:19:28,308
[SPEAKER_08]: I just closed everything down when I was around.

927
01:19:28,368 --> 01:19:28,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

928
01:19:49,994 --> 01:19:55,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, it's, it's not really a concern, but it was just maybe an add to number 82.

929
01:19:55,956 --> 01:20:00,938
[SPEAKER_08]: It's currently 82 says the secretary will actively monitor remote participants.

930
01:20:01,438 --> 01:20:12,041
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just thinking it should say, um, the secretary and the mayor and the secretary will actively monitor, uh, remote participants to identify when there was a hand raise.

931
01:20:12,341 --> 01:20:17,243
[SPEAKER_08]: So that way there, we have two eyes looking out the mayor and the secretary to just make sure everybody's heard.

932
01:20:18,589 --> 01:20:23,533
[SPEAKER_05]: just to- It's actually Dr. Cushing or the superintendent that usually do it for me.

933
01:20:23,573 --> 01:20:24,493
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't bring a computer.

934
01:20:24,533 --> 01:20:25,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

935
01:20:25,254 --> 01:20:25,494
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

936
01:20:25,834 --> 01:20:29,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I guess, you know, then let me, just to have another person on that.

937
01:20:30,818 --> 01:20:44,768
[SPEAKER_08]: So then my amendment would say the secretary and superintendent or another administrator, designated administrator will actively monitor remote participants to identify when there's a hand raised.

938
01:20:45,388 --> 01:20:45,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.

939
01:20:49,615 --> 01:20:51,996
[SPEAKER_07]: need a little more, what does it say?

940
01:20:53,896 --> 01:21:06,099
[SPEAKER_05]: The secretary and superintendent or administrator will actively monitor participants to identify when there is a raised hand to speak on any item on the agenda pursuant to the policy.

941
01:21:07,820 --> 01:21:10,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion for approval by member Kreatz, seconded by?

942
01:21:12,961 --> 01:21:13,381
[SPEAKER_12]: Second.

943
01:21:13,862 --> 01:21:15,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin, roll call please.

944
01:21:20,537 --> 01:21:20,637
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

945
01:21:20,697 --> 01:21:21,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

946
01:21:21,237 --> 01:21:21,357
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

947
01:21:21,417 --> 01:21:21,577
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

948
01:21:21,597 --> 01:21:21,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

949
01:21:22,078 --> 01:21:22,198
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

950
01:21:22,718 --> 01:21:22,918
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

951
01:21:23,958 --> 01:21:24,298
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

952
01:21:29,441 --> 01:21:29,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

953
01:21:29,681 --> 01:21:29,741
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

954
01:21:30,781 --> 01:21:30,901
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

955
01:21:30,921 --> 01:21:31,101
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

956
01:21:31,241 --> 01:21:31,361
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

957
01:21:31,401 --> 01:21:31,461
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

958
01:21:49,290 --> 01:21:49,751
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I did.

959
01:21:49,871 --> 01:21:50,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Haynes?

960
01:21:50,992 --> 01:21:53,515
[SPEAKER_07]: I typed Member Haynes.

961
01:21:53,535 --> 01:21:54,036
[SPEAKER_05]: No problem.

962
01:21:55,157 --> 01:21:55,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Seven, the affirmative.

963
01:21:55,898 --> 01:21:56,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Zero, the negative.

964
01:21:56,538 --> 01:21:57,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Paper passes.

965
01:21:59,321 --> 01:22:03,566
[SPEAKER_08]: I think number 83 is redundant with 82.

966
01:22:03,606 --> 01:22:08,832
[SPEAKER_08]: 83 says the secretary will ensure the chair is aware when remote participants wish to speak.

967
01:22:09,778 --> 01:22:14,480
[SPEAKER_08]: that it's the same as number 82, I'm thinking.

968
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:19,163
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just think we should just strike number 83 because it's redundant.

969
01:22:24,865 --> 01:22:25,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Either way is fine with me.

970
01:22:25,786 --> 01:22:26,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a second for that motion?

971
01:22:27,006 --> 01:22:28,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

972
01:22:28,047 --> 01:22:29,067
[SPEAKER_07]: May I just speak on this real quick?

973
01:22:29,468 --> 01:22:32,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau and then seconded by Member McBotham.

974
01:22:33,009 --> 01:22:33,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

975
01:22:36,245 --> 01:22:52,059
[SPEAKER_07]: When more than one person is responsible for doing something like that, then when all three of us are in this meeting, the secretary, the superintendent, Peter, we're all there and a hand goes up and one of us is responsible.

976
01:22:54,201 --> 01:23:00,866
[SPEAKER_07]: That means that it's sort of like when you arrive on the scene and everybody's like, somebody must've called 911, right?

977
01:23:02,388 --> 01:23:03,729
[SPEAKER_07]: And it turns out

978
01:23:04,345 --> 01:23:06,586
[SPEAKER_07]: everybody's standing around with their phones assuming somebody else called 911.

979
01:23:07,406 --> 01:23:12,869
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do feel a little concerned that we are not specifying who is responsible.

980
01:23:12,989 --> 01:23:23,453
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not that other people can't do it because certainly even in the present day, if the mayor hasn't noticed a hand going up, I'll jump up or jump in and say, mayor, there's somebody with their hand up.

981
01:23:24,434 --> 01:23:32,297
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think that we need to be precise about who's responsible, whether it's at every meeting saying, at the beginning of the meeting,

982
01:23:34,892 --> 01:24:02,306
[SPEAKER_07]: somebody is who's on first because otherwise we're going to move on to and we've had this happen in meetings on zoom on frankly a number of occasions where hands were up and none of you know we didn't have a laptop in the particular setting or whatever we were in person and there were this is usually a problem with somebody's in we're in person and there's public that's not and the hands go up and we move on to the next agenda item um and

983
01:24:03,603 --> 01:24:10,365
[SPEAKER_07]: that it creates this weird thing where it looks like we just didn't let the public speak, which I do not want us to be in that situation.

984
01:24:10,445 --> 01:24:30,252
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just a little concerned that we are not saying who's going to do this because I know in our last meeting and the meeting before where the superintendent had a laptop up where she sits and both the mayor and the chair and the

985
01:24:30,725 --> 01:24:35,328
[SPEAKER_07]: superintendent would notice the hands are up and I was trying to like say hands are up.

986
01:24:36,288 --> 01:24:39,870
[SPEAKER_07]: It gets confusing if three of us are trying to say that there's somebody wants to speak.

987
01:24:40,651 --> 01:24:52,457
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't really care who it is, but it has to be, somebody has to know it's their responsibility to make sure that it happens or we move on and the public doesn't get to speak.

988
01:24:52,777 --> 01:24:55,499
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted my little say on that.

989
01:24:55,519 --> 01:24:57,000
[SPEAKER_12]: Mayor.

990
01:24:58,063 --> 01:24:58,783
[SPEAKER_12]: Member McLaughlin.

991
01:24:59,424 --> 01:25:00,404
[SPEAKER_12]: Can we just merge 82 and 83?

992
01:25:02,225 --> 01:25:03,545
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, just merge 82 and 83.

993
01:25:03,785 --> 01:25:05,786
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I second that.

994
01:25:05,826 --> 01:25:07,447
[SPEAKER_12]: And I withdraw mine.

995
01:25:08,547 --> 01:25:12,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, and I withdraw mine.

996
01:25:12,989 --> 01:25:16,250
[SPEAKER_05]: And that would just be the last sentence of 82.

997
01:25:16,731 --> 01:25:21,052
[SPEAKER_05]: A motion by Member Kreatz, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

998
01:25:21,813 --> 01:25:22,973
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor, roll call.

999
01:25:24,294 --> 01:25:24,754
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Graham.

1000
01:25:25,394 --> 01:25:25,554
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1001
01:25:28,598 --> 01:25:28,818
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct?

1002
01:25:28,838 --> 01:25:28,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1003
01:25:30,659 --> 01:25:31,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Hays?

1004
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:32,400
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1005
01:25:33,241 --> 01:25:33,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Member McLaughlin?

1006
01:25:34,462 --> 01:25:34,802
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1007
01:25:35,602 --> 01:25:36,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Mustone?

1008
01:25:40,906 --> 01:25:41,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Mustone?

1009
01:25:41,606 --> 01:25:44,828
[SPEAKER_07]: Thumbs up.

1010
01:25:44,848 --> 01:25:46,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice to see you, Mia.

1011
01:25:46,509 --> 01:25:48,330
[SPEAKER_07]: You can put a thumb up.

1012
01:25:48,730 --> 01:25:50,471
[SPEAKER_07]: There, okay.

1013
01:25:50,552 --> 01:25:51,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau, yes.

1014
01:25:51,612 --> 01:25:52,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor Longo turns.

1015
01:25:52,793 --> 01:25:54,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, on the affirmative, zero on the negative.

1016
01:25:54,634 --> 01:25:54,954
[SPEAKER_05]: 82 and 83 emerged.

1017
01:26:01,097 --> 01:26:03,358
[SPEAKER_05]: any questions on duties of the superintendent?

1018
01:26:04,699 --> 01:26:08,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I wanted to mention on number 84.

1019
01:26:08,461 --> 01:26:12,003
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there just needs to be an exception to this rule.

1020
01:26:12,763 --> 01:26:19,466
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it should say the superintendent will be present in person or via remote participation at all regular meetings of the school committee.

1021
01:26:20,787 --> 01:26:21,727
[SPEAKER_08]: With the exception of

1022
01:26:24,297 --> 01:26:26,980
[SPEAKER_08]: illness, bereavement, or emergency.

1023
01:26:28,261 --> 01:26:39,171
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I would like to just hear from the superintendent about what her thoughts are on that because, you know, people are going to get sick, there are going to be family emergencies, you know, so that's what I was thinking.

1024
01:26:40,292 --> 01:26:40,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a second?

1025
01:26:40,953 --> 01:26:41,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

1026
01:26:43,415 --> 01:26:46,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Question for approval by Member Kreatz, seconded by Member Ruseau.

1027
01:26:46,318 --> 01:26:46,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call, please.

1028
01:26:53,630 --> 01:26:54,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Graham.

1029
01:26:54,811 --> 01:26:55,051
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1030
01:26:56,252 --> 01:26:56,772
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Kreatz.

1031
01:26:57,453 --> 01:26:57,673
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1032
01:26:58,554 --> 01:26:59,094
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Hays.

1033
01:26:59,955 --> 01:27:00,215
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1034
01:27:01,095 --> 01:27:01,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Member McLaughlin.

1035
01:27:02,236 --> 01:27:02,577
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1036
01:27:03,357 --> 01:27:04,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Mustone.

1037
01:27:04,618 --> 01:27:04,898
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1038
01:27:06,780 --> 01:27:07,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau, yes.

1039
01:27:07,860 --> 01:27:08,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor Lococo.

1040
01:27:09,361 --> 01:27:09,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1041
01:27:10,022 --> 01:27:11,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1042
01:27:13,885 --> 01:27:14,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

1043
01:27:17,868 --> 01:27:18,288
[SPEAKER_12]: Mayor.

1044
01:27:18,908 --> 01:27:19,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin.

1045
01:27:21,283 --> 01:27:28,185
[SPEAKER_12]: If I may, I just wanted to thank Member Ruseau for all of the hard work on the proposed rules.

1046
01:27:28,225 --> 01:27:43,651
[SPEAKER_12]: This was obviously a tedious project and a lot of work, and the collaboration, as was just exemplified through Member Kreatz, I think this is a really good example of how we can all work together as a team and

1047
01:27:44,551 --> 01:27:48,632
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, at times it was arduous, but I think this has been productive.

1048
01:27:48,672 --> 01:27:50,673
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just wanted to say thank you.

1049
01:27:50,973 --> 01:28:03,297
[SPEAKER_12]: And I do have a question about how this will be married, how this document will be married to the policy or how the policy piece will be cross-referenced to the rules.

1050
01:28:03,357 --> 01:28:05,338
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know that we've said there's a distinguished

1051
01:28:06,558 --> 01:28:12,022
[SPEAKER_12]: meant between the rules and policy are distinguishable from each other, but I do see repeats in them.

1052
01:28:12,102 --> 01:28:22,469
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm wondering what folks are thinking in terms of that, because I don't want them to be too redundant and people not to be not thinking that they're repetitive and wouldn't read the rules versus the policy.

1053
01:28:22,509 --> 01:28:24,770
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm curious what my colleagues would say about that.

1054
01:28:24,850 --> 01:28:25,210
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1055
01:28:31,755 --> 01:28:35,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Wussow, then Member Krentz.

1056
01:28:36,635 --> 01:28:37,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mayor.

1057
01:28:37,836 --> 01:28:41,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

1058
01:28:41,977 --> 01:28:53,783
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate it, and I definitely, you know, as much as I felt like I came here with a set of rules that I thought was, this is great, we should just go with this, I will admit that they are, in fact, much better now that we have collaborated on them.

1059
01:28:54,963 --> 01:28:58,005
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish that there was, sometimes I wish the open meeting was a little

1060
01:28:58,551 --> 01:29:05,741
[SPEAKER_07]: at exceptions where we could literally have just done this through the years in a Google Doc, but that isn't an option.

1061
01:29:05,822 --> 01:29:07,424
[SPEAKER_07]: So I really appreciate that.

1062
01:29:07,804 --> 01:29:12,471
[SPEAKER_07]: I do have a motion that I think would cover those concerns and if I can just make that right now.

1063
01:29:14,125 --> 01:29:30,418
[SPEAKER_07]: I motion to allow the secretary or anybody else interested to go through these rules and provide references as appropriate after each rule or in line as appropriate for mass general law, school committee policy and Robert's rules, which we've discussed earlier in the format.

1064
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:34,422
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just provided a format of like policy ID or whatever.

1065
01:29:35,242 --> 01:29:40,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Further, I will embed hypertext links to these references when possible.

1066
01:29:41,657 --> 01:29:59,008
[SPEAKER_07]: further the secretary in the event the rules are adopted, we'll provide a list of policies that must be updated to reflect the changes contained within the approved rules of the Medford School Committee and bring this list to the committee for referral to the appropriate subcommittees at the regular meeting following approval.

1067
01:29:59,988 --> 01:30:03,250
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lot of words, let me put it in the chat so you can see it.

1068
01:30:03,270 --> 01:30:07,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I make a friendly amendment, Mayor?

1069
01:30:08,734 --> 01:30:10,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin.

1070
01:30:11,578 --> 01:30:28,409
[SPEAKER_12]: I would just also ask that I mean, we did find obviously the policy rules for the website that were slightly embedded and also their formatted, according to the MSC because it was a MSC that was document that was.

1071
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:38,024
[SPEAKER_12]: sort of part of our subscription package and then modified based on, you know, previous meetings and what have you.

1072
01:30:38,164 --> 01:30:40,204
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just, it's a very cumbersome document.

1073
01:30:40,245 --> 01:30:41,545
[SPEAKER_12]: It's very difficult to read.

1074
01:30:41,605 --> 01:30:43,526
[SPEAKER_12]: The font, frankly, is very difficult to read.

1075
01:30:44,146 --> 01:30:58,673
[SPEAKER_12]: And particularly if the policy, I mean, the rules are gonna be in a, I would assume, an easy to read Google doc that the policy could be in a similar sort of format just so that they're not, because they do relate to each other, they're interconnected.

1076
01:30:59,233 --> 01:31:00,614
[SPEAKER_12]: and so that the format is similar.

1077
01:31:00,654 --> 01:31:18,222
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would just make a friendly amendment that the policy document is updated to a similar format as the rules document so that they are user-friendly for constituents and candidates.

1078
01:31:20,923 --> 01:31:21,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor.

1079
01:31:23,624 --> 01:31:24,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Kreatz and Member Ruseau.

1080
01:31:27,967 --> 01:31:38,477
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a question about number 90 so I don't know if you want to finish the conversation that's currently ongoing, and then I can go after that, please.

1081
01:31:42,758 --> 01:31:48,842
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not okay with that friendly amendment because that's hundreds of pages of policy.

1082
01:31:50,163 --> 01:32:00,409
[SPEAKER_07]: This current document is 13 pages, and I really don't have the bandwidth to spend weeks or months reformatting our entire policy manual.

1083
01:32:02,331 --> 01:32:08,675
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree wholeheartedly with Member McLaughlin that the policy service format is a mess.

1084
01:32:09,335 --> 01:32:10,316
[SPEAKER_12]: Can I make a point of information?

1085
01:32:10,336 --> 01:32:12,097
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Ruseau, I'm offering to do that.

1086
01:32:12,847 --> 01:32:14,127
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not asking that you do that.

1087
01:32:14,387 --> 01:32:18,388
[SPEAKER_12]: I just think it needs to be a user-friendly document similar to this 13-page document.

1088
01:32:18,688 --> 01:32:19,689
[SPEAKER_12]: I've already cut in pieces.

1089
01:32:19,709 --> 01:32:21,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information needs to be a question.

1090
01:32:21,189 --> 01:32:24,430
[SPEAKER_05]: So can member McLaughlin have the floor?

1091
01:32:25,610 --> 01:32:25,810
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1092
01:32:26,490 --> 01:32:27,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin.

1093
01:32:27,831 --> 01:32:28,291
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1094
01:32:28,551 --> 01:32:37,513
[SPEAKER_12]: So the point of information was, I guess, would it be acceptable if I offered to do the reformatting similar to the rules document?

1095
01:32:42,995 --> 01:32:48,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor, if I may, I think, and you can make that motion, send it to the next school committee meeting.

1096
01:32:48,799 --> 01:32:50,860
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't seem relevant to what we're doing.

1097
01:32:52,061 --> 01:32:59,806
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I don't wanna change this motion to include additional work that's not related to the rules document.

1098
01:33:01,167 --> 01:33:01,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1099
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:11,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so on member Ruseau's resolution to put the links in,

1100
01:33:12,688 --> 01:33:13,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a second?

1101
01:33:16,849 --> 01:33:17,309
[SPEAKER_12]: Second.

1102
01:33:18,129 --> 01:33:19,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin, roll call.

1103
01:33:26,891 --> 01:33:27,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Graham?

1104
01:33:28,032 --> 01:33:28,272
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1105
01:33:29,512 --> 01:33:34,093
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Kreatz?

1106
01:33:34,953 --> 01:33:35,213
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1107
01:33:36,794 --> 01:33:37,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Hays?

1108
01:33:37,694 --> 01:33:37,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1109
01:33:37,994 --> 01:33:41,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Member McLaughlin?

1110
01:33:41,744 --> 01:33:42,044
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1111
01:33:42,885 --> 01:33:43,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Mustone?

1112
01:33:44,087 --> 01:33:44,367
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1113
01:33:45,368 --> 01:33:46,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau, yes.

1114
01:33:47,190 --> 01:33:47,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?

1115
01:33:48,892 --> 01:33:49,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1116
01:33:50,113 --> 01:33:51,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Seven affirmative, zero negative.

1117
01:33:51,535 --> 01:33:52,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

1118
01:33:54,318 --> 01:33:54,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Krutz?

1119
01:33:55,784 --> 01:34:00,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I just wanted to ask the superintendent about the rule number 90.

1120
01:34:00,826 --> 01:34:10,231
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe this is a new rule that's being put forth and this would be something that would be handled by her team.

1121
01:34:10,311 --> 01:34:16,474
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would just like to hear from Dr. Edward-Vinson on what her thoughts are on rule 90.

1122
01:34:16,514 --> 01:34:16,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1123
01:34:18,863 --> 01:34:19,103
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1124
01:34:19,384 --> 01:34:25,190
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, based on some of the information from some of our meetings toward the end of the year.

1125
01:34:30,985 --> 01:34:34,447
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of tracking system right now that has most of these fields.

1126
01:34:35,288 --> 01:34:37,249
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ms.

1127
01:34:37,289 --> 01:34:41,332
[SPEAKER_00]: Weiss has been managing that with the new numbering system.

1128
01:34:42,132 --> 01:34:52,599
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will be able to add the few additional fields that are not on the tracker that we currently have with the new numbering system.

1129
01:34:53,660 --> 01:35:02,123
[SPEAKER_00]: And next to letter G, my request was going to be to change continuing to containing if it was supposed to be containing.

1130
01:35:02,163 --> 01:35:03,343
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure, Member Ruseau.

1131
01:35:05,064 --> 01:35:09,365
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have already started an internal tracking system.

1132
01:35:09,465 --> 01:35:18,107
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's being done right now in order to kind of help us keep track of everything that's taking place right now.

1133
01:35:18,128 --> 01:35:21,088
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1134
01:35:24,702 --> 01:35:25,383
[SPEAKER_04]: member Rousseau.

1135
01:35:26,383 --> 01:35:26,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1136
01:35:26,964 --> 01:35:27,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yes.

1137
01:35:28,025 --> 01:35:35,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I guess I will just make a motion to, um, correct a couple of the there's actually two other.

1138
01:35:36,852 --> 01:35:41,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Errors in item number 90 in D. It says date sent.

1139
01:35:42,457 --> 01:35:43,998
[SPEAKER_07]: It should say the subcommittee.

1140
01:35:44,699 --> 01:35:52,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Um and in F, it says meeting dates of subcommittee where the item has been on and should say the agenda.

1141
01:35:52,831 --> 01:35:56,553
[SPEAKER_07]: and those two plus changing, continuing to containing.

1142
01:35:57,453 --> 01:36:00,014
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's my motion to make those three changes.

1143
01:36:02,115 --> 01:36:02,796
[SPEAKER_14]: Second.

1144
01:36:03,576 --> 01:36:08,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by member Kreatz and McLaughlin.

1145
01:36:09,519 --> 01:36:09,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call.

1146
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:11,760
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Graham.

1147
01:36:12,420 --> 01:36:12,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1148
01:36:13,741 --> 01:36:14,221
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Kreatz.

1149
01:36:14,241 --> 01:36:15,022
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1150
01:36:16,082 --> 01:36:16,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Hays.

1151
01:36:17,463 --> 01:36:17,743
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1152
01:36:18,683 --> 01:36:19,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Member McLaughlin.

1153
01:36:19,964 --> 01:36:20,244
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1154
01:36:21,245 --> 01:36:21,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Mustone.

1155
01:36:22,327 --> 01:36:22,607
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1156
01:36:23,527 --> 01:36:23,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1157
01:36:23,647 --> 01:36:23,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1158
01:36:23,747 --> 01:36:23,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Number.

1159
01:36:23,907 --> 01:36:25,808
[SPEAKER_07]: So yes, Mayor Lingo here.

1160
01:36:26,568 --> 01:36:26,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1161
01:36:26,728 --> 01:36:28,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the affirmative zero negative.

1162
01:36:29,448 --> 01:36:30,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Paper passes.

1163
01:36:41,471 --> 01:36:43,151
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Mayor.

1164
01:36:43,691 --> 01:36:44,051
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a

1165
01:36:52,567 --> 01:36:55,369
[SPEAKER_07]: It is, yes, rule number 85.

1166
01:36:55,429 --> 01:37:08,918
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to motion to strike the second to the last, the last line where it says, be the custodian of the school committee records and other papers.

1167
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:15,002
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe that that actually role has been assigned by the superintendent to someone else.

1168
01:37:15,342 --> 01:37:18,985
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't think we need to specify that.

1169
01:37:21,667 --> 01:37:23,288
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if the superintendent has thoughts on that.

1170
01:37:23,809 --> 01:37:26,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you just tell me reference which number and section?

1171
01:37:26,711 --> 01:37:27,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

1172
01:37:28,153 --> 01:37:42,606
[SPEAKER_07]: It's number 85, and it's identifying a bunch of things that the superintendent will do, but it also says that the superintendent will be the custodian of school committee records and other papers.

1173
01:37:48,958 --> 01:37:51,659
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I support your revision, members, so.

1174
01:37:54,879 --> 01:37:55,339
[SPEAKER_00]: Second.

1175
01:37:57,700 --> 01:37:58,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion by members.

1176
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:00,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so you'll leave it as alone.

1177
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:02,000
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll leave it alone.

1178
01:38:02,020 --> 01:38:02,821
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't need a second.

1179
01:38:04,421 --> 01:38:06,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

1180
01:38:07,401 --> 01:38:08,262
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fine as written?

1181
01:38:08,942 --> 01:38:09,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it fine as written?

1182
01:38:10,622 --> 01:38:15,963
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we're striking the part where it says, be this custodian of school committee's records and other papers.

1183
01:38:18,012 --> 01:38:20,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's the custodian of records, if I just may ask?

1184
01:38:23,353 --> 01:38:24,733
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that is Ms.

1185
01:38:24,773 --> 01:38:25,053
[SPEAKER_01]: Wise.

1186
01:38:30,695 --> 01:38:33,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Should we add that to this rule or because Ms.

1187
01:38:33,475 --> 01:38:37,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Wise works for the superintendent, leave it in as under the superintendent?

1188
01:38:41,337 --> 01:38:46,818
[SPEAKER_07]: My understanding of this is that it's a legally required role that has to be applied

1189
01:38:48,510 --> 01:38:51,292
[SPEAKER_07]: An employee has to be identified as being that person.

1190
01:38:51,372 --> 01:38:55,756
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't think our rule can say the superintendent if it's not the superintendent.

1191
01:38:56,497 --> 01:39:04,423
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm fine with changing it to some other language, but who the custodian is has to be transparent, I think.

1192
01:39:05,144 --> 01:39:15,673
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, if we want to add another rule, although I don't know that it goes under duties of superintendent, maybe another rule that says the superintendent will appoint a superintendent

1193
01:39:16,658 --> 01:39:18,299
[SPEAKER_07]: custodian of our records.

1194
01:39:21,702 --> 01:39:30,549
[SPEAKER_11]: Make a motion that we add a sentence that says the superintendent will ensure that there is an appointed custodian of records at all times.

1195
01:39:32,170 --> 01:39:33,231
[SPEAKER_12]: May I, Mayor?

1196
01:39:33,871 --> 01:39:35,032
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, Member McLaughlin.

1197
01:39:35,993 --> 01:39:42,057
[SPEAKER_12]: Appointed custodian of record that is published, you know, on the website or something that people know who it is.

1198
01:39:43,418 --> 01:39:44,099
[SPEAKER_12]: Friendly amendment.

1199
01:39:45,340 --> 01:39:45,460
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

1200
01:39:49,234 --> 01:39:49,654
[SPEAKER_12]: Second.

1201
01:39:50,876 --> 01:39:51,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion.

1202
01:39:53,819 --> 01:39:55,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, may I just try to get the language.

1203
01:39:56,561 --> 01:40:03,388
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would change the language to end after record keeping system period.

1204
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:12,677
[SPEAKER_07]: The superintendent will ensure that there is an appointed

1205
01:40:15,274 --> 01:40:24,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Custodian of records and this information will be posted on our website.

1206
01:40:31,728 --> 01:40:33,770
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we had a second.

1207
01:40:36,232 --> 01:40:36,573
[SPEAKER_01]: We did.

1208
01:40:40,977 --> 01:40:42,598
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other, should we go for roll call now?

1209
01:40:46,512 --> 01:40:46,712
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1210
01:40:49,514 --> 01:40:52,557
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Graham?

1211
01:40:53,037 --> 01:40:53,278
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1213
01:40:55,619 --> 01:40:55,820
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

01:40:56,780 --> 01:40:57,301
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Hays?

1215
01:40:58,302 --> 01:40:58,542
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1216
01:40:59,483 --> 01:41:00,704
[SPEAKER_01]: Member McLaughlin?

1217
01:41:01,324 --> 01:41:01,664
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

01:41:02,685 --> 01:41:03,406

1219
01:41:03,866 --> 01:41:04,146
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1221
01:41:08,550 --> 01:41:08,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1222
01:41:10,572 --> 01:41:11,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor Luggo-Kern?

1223
01:41:11,973 --> 01:41:12,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1224
01:41:12,333 --> 01:41:13,654
[SPEAKER_01]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1225
01:41:13,694 --> 01:41:14,315
[SPEAKER_01]: Paper passes.

1226
01:41:30,613 --> 01:41:32,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we ready for a motion to adjourn?

1227
01:41:33,254 --> 01:41:33,894
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe we are.

1228
01:41:34,215 --> 01:41:34,595
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1229
01:41:35,055 --> 01:41:35,975
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion to adjourn.

1230
01:41:38,056 --> 01:41:44,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor, before we do that, should we have a motion to report this out to the committee at our next meeting?

1231
01:41:45,179 --> 01:41:46,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to report.
