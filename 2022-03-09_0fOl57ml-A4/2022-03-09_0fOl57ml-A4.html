    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=44.182s">We</a>  should have it, Brianna.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=47.224s">Thank</a>  you so much, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=49.025s">Okay,</a>  it is 4-5, the Medford School Committee, Committee of the Whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=55.689s">Meeting</a>  date is 3-9-2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=57.63s">There'll</a>  be a Committee of the Whole meeting on Wednesday, the 9th, 2022 from four to 6 p.m., held remotely on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=65.075s">The</a>  purpose of the meeting is to discuss, edit, and approve the draft of the school committee rules packet proposed by member Rousseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=72.147s">You</a>  can zoom in or you can call in using number 929-205-6099. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=76.83s">Please</a>  enter meeting ID 930-1644-8588 when prompted. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=86.935s">The</a>  purpose of the meeting is to discuss, edit and approve the draft of the school committee rules document proposed by member Rousseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=95.16s">If</a>  my memory is correct, we left off on page <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=102.933s">1112</a>  that we were reviewing and asking questions about. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=110.758s">Yes,</a>  member Cress has her hand up and then member Rousseau.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=117.325s">Yes,</a>  Mayor, I checked in with Mr. Russo the other week and we stopped at number 67. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=124.326s">I</a>  need to go back because I think we moved too quickly in the first meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=127.467s">I</a>  just have to bring something up about number 51 that I didn't get a chance to mention. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=132.728s">So</a>  I wanted to just kind of go back to just review number 51 again, because I had notes and I never got a chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=139.909s">I</a>  noted that I didn't get a chance to mention anything on number 51.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=144.217s">And</a>  I also just point of information also in there, if we could put up the document so that folks watching or at home can see the document that we're referring to, that would be helpful if someone could put it up as a screen share, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=159.844s">And</a>  then that way, I'm not switching between windows because I'm working on a laptop with an elevated foot and makes it a little tricky. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=167.587s">So</a>  the screen share would be great.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=170.549s">I</a>  have a hard copy, so I'm not sure if <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=174.852s">school</a>  admin could screen share. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=177.233s">And</a>  member Kreatz.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=179.993s">Peter,</a>  hold on.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=181.294s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=181.994s">And</a>  member Kreatz, why don't you start off by going to. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=184.735s">Point</a>  of order.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=187.696s">We</a>  haven't taken a roll call.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=189.556s">Roll</a>  call. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=190.396s">Roll</a>  call has been requested by member Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=193.717s">Please</a>  call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=195.258s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=196.178s">Member</a>  Graham.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=197.538s">Here.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=199.239s">And</a>  I'm using my memory since I left a little thing at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=202.52s">So</a>  I'm sorry they're going to be out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=204.605s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=207.087s">Member</a>  Hays? <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=208.668s">Here.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=209.729s">Member</a>  McLaughlin? <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=210.97s">Here.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=212.371s">Oh,</a>  Member Kreatz, you would have been ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=213.792s">Yes,</a>  here, here. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=215.474s">One,</a>  two, three, four. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=216.675s">Member</a>  Mustone will be joining us later. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=218.816s">And</a>  wait, one, two, three, four. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=222.319s">Member</a>  Ruseau? <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=223.86s">Five.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=227.783s">Mayor</a>  Lungo-Koehn, did I skip somebody? <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=229.805s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=231.066s">I</a>  think that's all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=232.347s">I'm</a>  used to having it written down.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=235.569s">I</a>  am here. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=236.049s">Yes,</a>  there's six in the affirmative, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=238.711s">So</a>  for now, we can move on to number 51, member Cressy, you had a question on that.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=248.337s">So</a>  I originally in the prior meeting, I had notes listed here that it says, you know, regular meetings will begin at 630. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=256.123s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=257.243s">We</a>  made that adjustment in the last meeting to correct it from another time that it had said no meetings at school <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=263.047s">committee</a>  will go beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=264.628s">It</a>  says 11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=266.049s">I</a>  just have concerns about that for everybody who is in the school committee meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=272.174s">The</a>  administrators, the students, the teachers, just everybody, the public watching. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=277.197s">I</a>  think 11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=279.159s">is</a>  just too late in the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=280.94s">We</a>  start at 6 30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=282.461s">I</a>  think it's more reasonable to have it go from like 6 30 to 9 30 and if there's a motion to recess <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=292.467s">Then</a>  we should take a roll call, you know, is there a motion to recess, you know, and put everything on the table that we haven't covered, and then it gets put on the next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=301.51s">So</a>  I, I have a motion to amend the time change from 11pm to 930pm. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=310.473s">And</a>  the chair will then ask you know as we're getting close to 930pm. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=314.798s">If</a>  there is a motion to recess or continue the meeting until an extended period of time is stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=320.784s">So</a>  for example, like the chair would say, is there a motion to recess the meeting if we're not done. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=326.17s">If</a>  we're close to being done, then you could maybe say, is there a motion to recess the meeting until like 10 p.m., you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=334.036s">And</a>  we might get done before 10 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=336.077s">But</a>  I just think going from 6.30 to 11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=340.981s">with</a>  everybody's busy days and lives and having to be at school the next morning or work very early. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=346.365s">I</a>  mean, I don't retain anything after 9 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=351.409s">It's</a>  just gone.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=352.87s">And-</a>  I second that member Kreatz.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=355.672s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=357.174s">The</a>  11 be moved to 930.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=360.137s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=362.579s">And</a>  by member McLaughlin, can I actually make a comment Mayor before we do the road, it would it be appropriate if I make it just a brief comment, or maybe we can hear from. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=376.265s">maybe</a>  we could hear from the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=377.865s">I</a>  mean, I know that this has been a conversation that I've had with a few of the administrators and to that exact point, I know that with COVID, obviously we had really long hours and really long meetings and hopefully we don't have to repeat any of that again anytime soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=392.529s">But</a>  even with 11 o'clock, getting up so early, I know from the administrator's perspective, I've heard the same, that it's been very difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=400.992s">And</a>  I also, <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=402.552s">definitely</a>  get really tired come 10 o'clock, especially if it's an intense meeting or there's a lot of material. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=407.674s">So</a>  just wanted to ask if we might hear a weigh in from the administration if they're able, if that sounds reasonable for them hourly.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=415.688s">Yeah,</a>  I definitely would say having the 930 end time is reasonable knowing that sometimes we have either executive sessions or we could have future subcommittee meetings or future committee of the whole meetings that are back to back to a regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=435.392s">So</a>  we still potentially could be meeting from four or five until <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=442.634s">9.30</a>  and then do a check-in at that point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=445.095s">I</a>  do think 11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=448.337s">and</a>  it's just, that's a little too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=456.402s">It's</a>  too long a day for us to be able to really function coherently. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=463.746s">So</a>  I would be in support of a 9.30 time to check in, knowing that we may start earlier.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=473.51s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=475.212s">Member</a>  Hays, then Member Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Sharon Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=479.956s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=480.857s">I</a>  mean, I certainly don't want to make anyone's days longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=483.86s">My</a>  only concern is that, and I don't remember historically, even though I attended most of the meetings, <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=490.971s">how</a>  if most of the meetings do go very long, but at some point, if we keep backloading meetings with the previous week's unfinished agenda items, we're not going to make it through all of our agenda items. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=504.743s">And</a>  I don't, again, I think I've said this a lot, but I don't know where the balance is, but I'm a little concerned that if we cut it off too early, <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=512.017s">that</a>  on those days where we have a lot of agenda items, they're just gonna keep getting pushed. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=517.059s">I</a>  thought the purpose of this particular rule was really just to say, that's the outside time we will go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=524.222s">Not</a>  that generally we expect our hope meetings to go that long, but that this would just be the very latest we would ever go. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=531.564s">So</a>  I'd be curious to hear what other people have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=534.885s">I</a>  am concerned about pushing items off too much.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=538.747s">Thank</a>  you, member Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=541.228s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=542.222s">Um,</a>  that is, uh, member Hays's interpretation was correct that this was, uh, sort of drawing a line in the sand. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=548.203s">We've</a>  gone past 11 o'clock on many occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=551.564s">Um,</a>  and I just thought it's important to remind us, the body, um, and anybody else watching that our meeting in February before the last one, I'm sorry, I don't have the date, had one item on the agenda, one item, and we went to 930. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=568.068s">Um,</a>  and that was a light <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=570.493s">That</a>  was as light of an agenda as I think I can recall us ever having. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=574.557s">So,</a>  I guess I don't mind 930. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=578.181s">I</a>  would just like to know what is the body intending to do when there's six unfinished items on the agenda, when there's public that has come to speak on items on the agenda that aren't going to happen till 1030 which would be awful but has happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=593.86s">Um,</a>  I mean, if this is going to be whatever our rules are, I mean, I, I, the language as it is, regardless of whether it's nine 30 or 11 is the meeting is over and that somebody stands up and makes a motion to say, let's just keep powering through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=609.332s">It's</a>  not that we will discuss, Hey, it's late. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=612.475s">I</a>  retired. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=613.055s">Should</a>  we keep going? <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=614.216s">It's</a>  the meeting is over. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=615.317s">That's</a>  the language of the role. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=617.419s">Um,</a>  so, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=621.03s">It's,</a>  to me, it seems like 9.30, I'd like to be out at 9.32. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=625.292s">I</a>  go to bed at nine o'clock on a regular night, but we will have, we will certainly have to discuss going to weekly meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=635.098s">And</a>  I know the administration's not interested in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=637.119s">We</a>  will have to go to weekly meetings if we're quitting at 9.30 on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=642.122s">We</a>  have one item on the agenda and we went to 9.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=647.391s">I</a>  assume that we have lots of work to do, that the school committee is not a rubber stamp. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=651.654s">And</a>  I mean, when this item goes to the floor of our meeting, this could drag one meeting past 9.30 and just approving these set of rules if the public has comments on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=662.1s">So</a>  the intent was 11 o'clock is the sort of the red line. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=668.744s">As</a>  it's approaching 11 o'clock, we make it clear we're gonna bump everything or we have a conversation about <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=675.186s">the</a>  two extra items that are on the agenda that we can't get to, but that we all have something in our minds that is like, okay, this is getting ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=684.929s">We've</a>  got to stop because we all agree, none of us, I'm not, and I've heard from other members, none of us are at our best at 11 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=693.488s">and</a>  certainly the administration and God forbid, principals have to be at a meeting that late because they have to be at school to crack a dawn the next day. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=702.43s">So</a>  that's all the 11 o'clock was intended for, but that was the intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=711.553s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=715.394s">Limbu</a>  Graham, did you have a hand up?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=717.343s">I</a>  did. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=717.623s">I</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=723.508s">So</a>  I think we've been elected to do a job, and I don't think the public particularly elected us to do an easy job. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=730.313s">And</a>  I think there's a general expectation that we'll come and do the job, whatever it takes. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=736.098s">And</a>  having said that, I'm also not a proponent of meeting very, very late into the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=742.122s">It's</a>  the reason why I voted against not starting a meeting until 6.30 p.m., because as I've been tracking, literally, since we took that vote, we never get to new business before seven o'clock, really before 7.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=757.928s">So</a>  we have a solid hour of things we have to accomplish easily, sometimes more, that happen before the kinds of items that the public would be wanting to weigh in on <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=772.572s">And</a>  it's the reason why I think 6.30 is late to start, given that we're all concerned about the administration and the demands we're placing on them in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=783.614s">They</a>  are full-time employees, they're not elected officials, but they're sort of stuck with us for the duration. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=791.595s">So</a>  I would be a proponent of starting the meeting at six and saying that the end time of the meeting <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=802.008s">would</a>  be 1030. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=803.248s">I</a>  feel like that gives us a bigger, better window to actually accomplish our business without having to go to weekly meetings, bringing in the outside a little bit from 11 o'clock, and really not compromising the public's ability to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=818.532s">And</a>  I would welcome my fellow committee members' thoughts on that.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=824.294s">Dr.</a>  Edward, Vincent, did you have a comment or not? <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=828.495s">I</a>  think you unmuted.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=830.253s">Yeah,</a>  just listening to what's being said, I think when the meetings need to run long or if there's a heavier agenda and we need to have longer meetings that those will happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=848.543s">And</a>  to member Rousseau's point, I think that some of our meetings just by nature, they do end up running long. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=857.569s">I</a>  can say to you, <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=860.604s">that</a>  the 11 o'clock end time was shocking to a lot of colleagues that I just was getting some feedback for from MASC. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=872.51s">They</a>  have stated to us that efficient meetings should be anywhere between an hour and a half to two hours long to be able to <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=882.154s">go</a>  through an agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=883.796s">And</a>  so we on the school side have been making a significant effort to try to be as concise as possible, and not have. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=895.773s">you</a>  know, excessive reports that we're not able to get through it in a reasonable amount of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=902.037s">So</a>  whether we start at six o'clock and you say to yourself, a two hour window that would still bring us to 8.30, whether you start at 6.30 to 8.30, nine o'clock, 9.30, I had just felt that that would be reasonable from a planning perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=925.356s">It</a>  just makes for a very long day for the school side staff, because it's not like anyone starts work at noontime, or two in the afternoon, and says that they're going to work until 11pm. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=939.508s">If</a>  necessary, like everyone is in the field working a full day, and then going to the school committee meetings which we understand have to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=950.78s">And</a>  so I'm just thinking about bandwidth and trying to have that balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=957.064s">So</a>  my hope would be that we would not have many meetings that have to go to 11pm and trying to keep the agendas concise enough that, you know, it could be a robust two hours, including the conversations that take place to two and a half hours and if we need three hours or four hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=978.439s">then</a>  you as a body could just vote to say, you know, this is an important topic today. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=984.481s">We</a>  need to continue to, you know, push through and get to the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=987.582s">Because</a>  we, I think sometimes there have been votes where, especially when amendments were being made and these were meetings that went so late into the evening that by the time it took place, people weren't really sure on, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1005.407s">what</a>  was the final motion, because it just got too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1010.349s">And</a>  I just feel for everyone's work-life balance and mental health, that having a reasonable cutoff time would be better.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1028.576s">Member</a>  Kreatz?</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1029.865s">Yes,</a>  and I'm going to keep my motion on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1032.686s">I</a>  happen to, you know, understand and agree with the superintendent, I have to get up at 445am, and I am just exhausted by 930, and it's the next day. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1048.97s">It's</a>  like I was on a boat or a plane. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1052.332s">I</a>  can't get up. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1053.193s">I</a>  can't think. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1054.433s">I</a>  drink coffee. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1055.294s">It</a>  just doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1057.295s">You</a>  can't focus. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1058.155s">Even</a>  the next day, you're affected by the very, very, very long day. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1063.698s">And</a>  you can't drink coffee before the school committee meeting, because then I'll be up all night. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1068.861s">So</a>  it's just I'm going to keep my motion on the floor, and I can hear from both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1073.684s">And</a>  I just think that if we, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1077.566s">have</a>  this time frame and we know that we're going later and there's important agenda items or there are people from the public just as i mentioned in the part of the motion that a motion can be made to extend the meeting until xx time and i think that would be reasonable for the administrators the school committee the public and just the students just everybody i'm just trying to make it <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1103.391s">equitable</a>  for everybody, everybody has to get somewhere in the next morning, whether it's school, work, family, everybody's got to get up, you know, so I'm just trying to, you know, I've seen our meetings, they can carry on, we're doing much better. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1118.682s">And</a>  sometimes there are items that take longer, but that's not typical. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1124.568s">Typical,</a>  we do run to 930. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1127.191s">And</a>  then there's always the occasional late meeting, which can happen with a controversial or very important topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1136.56s">So</a>  we're not like, <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1139.704s">We're</a>  not blocking it down to just 6.30 to 9.30, that's it, the meeting's over. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1144.427s">We're</a>  still giving, as part of my motion, I'm still giving the offer to extend the meeting if a motion is made. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1151.192s">But</a>  I won't talk, I let other people talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1153.654s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1153.974s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1154.775s">Can</a>  I ask Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1156.316s">Wise,</a>  if you could mark member Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1158.818s">Stone</a>  as present, and then just also maybe a compromise, maybe we could go to 10 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1165.122s">and</a>  always can extend it after 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1167.649s">That's</a>  a good compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1168.578s">Maybe</a>  we can have a motion on the floor.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1173.136s">I</a>  currently emotion with a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1176.358s">So</a>  if we want. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1177.639s">So,</a>  member credits put emotion I seconded it we were debating the motion but the. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1184.784s">If</a>  you're suggesting an amendment to member credits motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1187.926s">I'm</a>  not sure what you're suggesting but there's a, there is a motion on the floor with a second.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1192.909s">I</a>  just wanted to mention that would be up to member credits if she wants to withdraw and present.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1198.965s">I</a>  don't wanna withdraw the motion, but I'm thinking, I heard from Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1203.487s">Graham</a>  and maybe we could make the alternative where we could start the meeting at six, we could end the meeting at 9.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1212.812s">So</a>  that's the additional half hour so that we're not keeping the administrators past 9.30 unless there's an extension to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1221.556s">So</a>  I'm making a motion now to change the start time to 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1226.218s">and</a>  the end time to 9.30 p.m.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1229.327s">Just</a>  if I may, that wasn't Member Graham's suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1233.208s">She</a>  said six to 1030. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1234.928s">So</a>  I just want to make that clear.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1237.449s">Right,</a>  and I'm sorry, I meant to say the start time that she mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1242.35s">So</a>  my motion, I'm going to change to, let me just get back. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1247.812s">I</a>  just have to close the window to look at the words here, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1251.993s">So</a>  I'm amending my original motion to read <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1258.369s">The</a>  regular school committee will begin at 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1262.572s">No</a>  meeting of the school committee will go beyond 9.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1267.156s">If</a>  the school committee is still meeting at 9.30 p.m., the chair will ask, is there a motion to recess the meeting until a certain time? <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1275.022s">Or</a>  is there a motion to extend the meeting beyond 9.30 in the evening and state the time so that everybody understands that there is an end time coming, whether it's going to be 10 or 10.30? <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1288.212s">Um,</a>  a motion to continue the meeting requires the two thirds vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1291.354s">So</a>  the time changes would be 6.00 PM to 9.30 PM second member.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1301.661s">And</a>  I'll just, it's four 30 now member Hays and member Graham.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1308.146s">I</a>  also have my hand up mayor.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1309.387s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1309.767s">Oh,</a>  and then member McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[Sharon Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1313.564s">So</a>  I just feel like we had a pretty lengthy discussion about the six versus 630 start time last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1319.509s">And</a>  if we're going to keep revisiting these, it's going to make this meeting really lengthy, but <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1323.47s">We</a>  did have a discussion about how the six o'clock time is much harder for community members who want to watch, because that's a time when either they're just getting home from work, a lot of people, or busy getting dinner ready, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1339.923s">And</a>  so we had a long discussion about keeping it at 6.30 because of that very reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1346.188s">So</a>  I would vote to stay with that, but I guess we'll take a vote on the motion.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1351.955s">Okay,</a>  and you can always motion to sever, start and end time if you want, Member Hays, Member Graham, and then Member McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1363.72s">I</a>  am sensitive to the fact that balancing all of these competing priorities is really hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1371.463s">I</a>  just go back to thinking about the job we have been elected to do, and sometimes that job is going to be longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1379.046s">I</a>  think it has to, <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1380.449s">You</a>  know, there have to be some guardrails that help us. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1384.18s">be</a>  efficient and brief and all those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1387.863s">So</a>  I do think starting at six, I don't think that erodes the public's ability to participate because like I said, we don't get to those agenda items until much, much later in the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1398.31s">Our</a>  meetings are recorded and can be watched at any time. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1401.452s">So</a>  I feel like that does mitigate some of that six o'clock start time concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1405.455s">I</a>  think if we could all agree on like a six to 10 <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1411.266s">time</a>  frame, I think that would actually be a nice compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1415.208s">And,</a>  you know, continuing to work to not be meeting at 10pm. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1420.731s">But,</a>  you know, Kathy, my suggestion would be six to 10, so that we're not fighting by a vote of two thirds about whether to continue a meeting, which could quickly become about avoiding agenda items. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1435.963s">and</a>  disappointing the public who showed up to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1437.945s">So</a>  I would like to see us think about the consequences of this in real time, playing out, needing two thirds of a vote to continue at times when we have a room full of people who came to speak is not going to be pleasant. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1458.52s">So</a>  I would rather our outside times <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1461.463s">be</a>  perceived as reasonable by everybody and never be construed that this committee is trying not to work hard on behalf of the students of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1471.152s">Thank</a>  you, Member Graham.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1472.133s">I</a>  mean, Member, thank you, Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1474.435s">Member</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1476.458s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1477.339s">I</a>  appreciate my colleagues' willingness for negotiation. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1482.063s">And</a>  I just also for clarity's sake, wanna just say, I don't think for me certainly, and I don't think for any of our colleagues, it's about working less. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1492.432s">I</a>  think it's about working more efficiently. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1494.454s">And</a>  I think everybody would agree that a lot of these meetings can go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1500.059s">And</a>  in some cases it's reasonable, in other cases I feel like it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1504.402s">But</a>  I do think that some of the rules that are being proposed could alleviate some of the issues that we've had in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1510.664s">So</a>  hopefully we'll see more efficient meetings based on some of the rules that are being proposed that we're going to be bringing before the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1517.825s">So</a>  there's that piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1520.266s">And</a>  I am, again, super sensitive to the staff and thinking about an additional four hours after their long day. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1527.287s">It</a>  is a lot, but I'm also sort of open to the idea of a <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1531.602s">six</a>  to 10 window with the full understanding that 10 is not the cutoff. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1537.223s">I</a>  mean, it's not the sort of the norm, it would be the cutoff. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1542.105s">But</a>  again, if folks are interested in severing the motion and looking at, you know, the start time and the end time, I think that's also a good consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1550.467s">But</a>  for me, <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1551.693s">I</a>  do think four-hour meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1552.894s">I</a>  mean, think about a business. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1554.035s">If</a>  you were in a four-hour meeting and people were like, you know, this is four-hour to meet, you know, after two hours, what's the productivity level? <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1561.479s">I</a>  think we would think about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1562.46s">Now</a>  I know businesses have more meetings than every two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1565.142s">So,</a>  you know, the other option is, you know, meet more frequently at less times. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1570.425s">And</a>  I think that that would also be a whole discussion that people would not, you know, there would be the pros and cons again. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1575.348s">So</a>  I'm just trying to put a few things out there, but I want to make it really clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1578.637s">One,</a>  it's not about hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1580.639s">I</a>  think we're all hard workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1581.98s">Two,</a>  it's about efficiency and having efficient meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1586.583s">And</a>  three, for me, it's about the sensitivity towards the staff that had very early mornings and very packed days. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1594.949s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1595.329s">Okay,</a>  there's a motion on the floor for a start time of six and an end time of 10 with the ability to extend, seconded by Member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1605.697s">Roll</a>  call. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1607.968s">Mayor,</a>  did you say that?</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1610.149s">What</a>  about, I didn't withdraw my motion.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1612.449s">I</a>  think the current motion is 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1616.23s">start,</a>  9.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1617.75s">end.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1618.791s">That</a>  was the motion that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1620.651s">McLaughlin</a>  seconded me on. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1621.751s">Gotcha.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1622.992s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1624.172s">Member</a>  Hays, did you want to speak one more time?</p>

    <p>[Sharon Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1625.732s">So</a>  I don't know how to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1630.734s">You</a>  suggested severing the motions. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1632.854s">I'd</a>  like to sever.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1633.574s">Motion</a>  to sever. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1636.095s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1637.113s">seconded</a>  by Member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1639.635s">Roll</a>  call vote.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1642.437s">So</a>  the motion to sever, just to be clear, you're severing the start time and end time, so we'll take a vote on each item, is that correct?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1649.202s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1652.024s">But</a>  first, we're voting on whether to sever the motion, is that correct?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0fOl57ml-A4&t=1655.506s">Yeah,</a>  first motion to sever is then seconded, and we'll take a roll call on that.</p>
