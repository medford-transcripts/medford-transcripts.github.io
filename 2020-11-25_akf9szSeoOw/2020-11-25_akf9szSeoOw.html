    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=93.038s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=94.059s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=94.84s">Mr.</a>  Milucheski will be co-presenting this with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=100.084s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Milucheski. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=102.384s">So</a>  good evening, Mayor, Mayor Lungo-Koehn, members of the school committee, Mustang Nation, and our community at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=111.07s">This</a>  evening, I'm going to present to you our report on the MPS reopening, updating our COVID-19 reopening dashboard. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=124.358s">In</a>  the summer, there were three guiding pillars that led the work that we've done with school reopening. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=132.259s">And</a>  those pillars always were and continue to guide the work that we're doing today. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=137.163s">Safety,</a>  equity, and consistency. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=147.731s">Back</a>  in October, on October 14th of this school year, we had a school committee meeting where we approved, the school committee approved the Medford Public Schools COVID-19 Reopening Dashboard. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=162.985s">This</a>  dashboard defined our evaluation of safety and it's used as a guide for our decision-making between the educational models that Medford offers, both our hybrid and remote. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=177.831s">The</a>  dashboard outlines three prevailing safety evaluations. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=183.733s">The</a>  first one is building classroom readiness. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=188.177s">The</a>  second one, Medford community health metrics. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=192.5s">And</a>  the third area, district and school specific metrics. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=201.805s">On</a>  October 14th, or since that time, two things have changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=207.969s">One,</a>  our experience working with positive COVID-19 cases in our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=215.017s">And</a>  secondly, the Department of Public Health had introduced an updated color-coded metric to outline community COVID-19 risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=228.119s">So</a>  one thing that hasn't changed, and this is from the CDC, indicators should neither be used in isolation nor should they be viewed as hard cutoffs. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=242.922s">by</a>  school departments, school administration, by all making these kinds of decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=249.084s">Rather,</a>  they should serve as broad guideposts of inherent risk to inform decision-making. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=258.368s">In</a>  Medford public schools, each situation that we have encountered since the start of school has brought a level of nuance. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=269.301s">Each</a>  situation has required us to be responsive to the individual circumstances of each case. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=278.029s">Dealing</a>  with COVID-19, it has put us in a position where we must continue to be flexible because each situation is individualized. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=292.71s">Additional</a>  CDC guidance from Dr. Robert Redfield. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=296.411s">This</a>  was last week's guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=299.191s">I've</a>  listed a few quotes, but one that stood out to me was the truth is for kids K to 12, one of the safest places they can be from our perspective is to remain in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=317.921s">Some</a>  of this data and what the CDC is recommending and what Dr. Robert Redfield was talking about, it holds true for Medford and our Medford context. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=337.737s">So</a>  in Medford, we went through a collaborative process and through that collaborative process, we developed <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=346.447s">the</a>  metrics that are in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=349.748s">But</a>  in addition to that, we have a database or a spreadsheet that I'm gonna share with you, which shows our positive COVID-19 case count to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=365.452s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Malachewski. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=368.612s">If</a>  I just provide a quick overview, which shows the data for our students and employees, staff, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=376.772s">But</a>  in particular, since the start of the school year in September, Medford Public Schools has had nine students test positive that are participating in the hybrid model and 18 students test positive that are participating in the remote instruction model. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=399.984s">And</a>  so I just want to present these numbers because right now we have approximately 1,700 students in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=409.407s">And</a>  so in our context, at this particular point in time, I just wanted to stress that we have noticed that we have had limited in-school transmission. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=426.714s">At</a>  this point in time, I would like to have my colleague, Mr. Tom Mieliszewski, provide additional information about the metrics.</p>

    <p>[Tom Milaschewski]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=438.244s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Edouard-Vincent, and good evening, Mayor Lungo-Koehn, and members of the Medford School Committee, and members of the Medford community. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=445.006s">It's</a>  nice to see you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=446.226s">So</a>  as Dr. Edouard-Vincent shared, I'm gonna talk about this second thing that has changed since October 14th, and our dashboard was approved, and that's this highlighted part number two here, DPH's updated color-coded metric to outline community COVID-19 risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=461.464s">Now,</a>  before I even talk about the shift, I would like to just make sure everyone's on the same page with sort of how this fits into our dashboard. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=470.25s">So</a>  I'm gonna show the COVID-19 dashboard that was approved on 10-14. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=475.194s">And</a>  you'll see that this is one of the three pieces that sort of how we evaluated safety was this DPH guidance, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=482.799s">So</a>  first being building classroom readiness. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=486.001s">Second</a>  being the Medford community health metrics, which here again using the Massachusetts Department of Public Health's color coded classification system. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=493.944s">And</a>  then third, our school district and school specific conditions where we looked at what is the transmission like in our schools, what do we do if there's one case here or two cases here and making those decisions at the specific school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=506.993s">So</a>  want to, before we dive into just the specifics around this shift, want to just emphasize that this is just, this Department of Public Health's color-coded classification system is just one of the variables that we're using to evaluate sort of safety and to guide our decision-making in terms of remote versus hybrid. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=525.7s">So</a>  with that said, nonetheless, there was a shift since this was approved back on October 14th. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=534.692s">I</a>  would like to quickly share with everyone what that shift looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=538.613s">So</a>  you'll see here, this is the new in the updated color code and classification system by the Department of Public Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=545.877s">And</a>  we should be looking in the far right column where it says over 50K given around 60,000 residents in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=553.301s">So</a>  you'll see that this color coded classification system brings in two variables. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=558.443s">First,</a>  the average case count per 100,000 people over the past two weeks, and also the percent positivity rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=566.345s">So</a>  we've looked at this a lot as a team and thought about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=569.246s">And</a>  we've also, as we thought about this sort of new classification system, we've also continued to look back at CDC guidance, which there is a, as you can imagine, a pretty strong alignment between guidance from the CDC and what we're seeing from DPH. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=585.91s">So</a>  you'll see here on the screen, this is a dashboard that was created by or titled CDC indicators and thresholds of risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=594.752s">which</a>  analyzes just the community prevalence of COVID and then the risk that that poses for transmission in schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=601.876s">You'll</a>  see here that this looks at two of the same variables that I just outlined. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=605.518s">If</a>  you look in the left column, number of new cases per 100,000 within the past 14 days, and also percent positivity, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=613.462s">So</a>  this system, right, or this dashboard is looking at two of the criteria that were also outlined here. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=620.436s">Now,</a>  internally, as we've kind of looked at this, we've played out several scenarios, and we're going to walk through one today, is if, say, using the CDC guidance, we were to have 19 positive cases in the last 14 days per 100,000 residents and be at 4.5% positivity rate, that would put us in this range of the green, of the lower risk of transmission in schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=649.384s">which</a>  is interesting when we compare that back to... <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=654.166s">sort</a>  of the DPH's guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=655.467s">If</a>  we had 19 positive cases per 100,000 in a four and a half percent positivity rate, that would put us in this bottom right quadrant right here in the red category. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=664.571s">So</a>  we share that to say that we have looked at like the alignment between sort of CDC and DPH. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=670.955s">We've</a>  also found that in our sort of, as we played out scenarios, that the DPH guidance has generally been more conservative than sort of the guidance from the CDC. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=682.155s">So</a>  sort of where does that bring us for now? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=684.436s">So</a>  what our recommendation and our proposal for tonight is that we update our dashboard to include the new color-coded classification system, which would look like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=698.023s">I'm</a>  gonna stop sharing my screen for a second and bring you into the actual dashboard. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=702.025s">So</a>  this was the dashboard that was approved <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=704.872s">back</a>  in the 14th of October, you'll see that it has the old sort of color coded classification system. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=711.596s">And</a>  what we're proposing for tonight is that we update this to have, again, the same number one around building classroom readiness. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=719.647s">update</a>  this number two to have the updated DPH guidance, and then keep this number three, which if you remember, this number three outlined specific scenarios in school related to if there's a positive case here or if there's a case in a cohort, if there's two cases in a cohort. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=735.831s">Our</a>  recommendation is to keep what the school committee had approved in numbers one and three, and right now just update this number two to now say using the Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=747.073s">Department</a>  of Public Health color-coded classification. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=749.934s">system.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=751.796s">Now</a>  as I should I want to go through just one other thing quickly which is last time in our last school committee member meeting there were some questions around Tufts and the numbers of how like Tufts impacts the Medford numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=764.264s">So</a>  we have been able to work with Tufts and we are able to pull out sort of Tufts data and compare that and think about what's the impact of including Tufts in our Medford data and also what's the impact of pulling those out. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=776.092s">And</a>  you see in a recent sort of two-week span from 10-28 to 11-11, with Tufts included, we're at a 0.96% positivity rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=784.195s">But</a>  if we pull Tufts out, we're at 1.1%. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=792.618s">So</a>  I think, you know, you could all decide about when and how would you want to pull Tufts out in certain circumstances and data analysis, but did just want to make it clear tonight that we do have the ability to pull Tufts out sort of as we're able to break down data. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=807.507s">So</a>  I know I quickly provided an overview of what our recommendations would be for tonight, but I want to turn it over to Dr. Edouard-Vincent, who's just going to provide that with a little bit more clarity, sort of on our final slide.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=818.61s">So</a>  our recommendations this evening are to continue to utilize parts one, building classroom readiness, and part three, district and school specific metrics from the original Medford Public Schools COVID-19 reopening dashboard as critical metrics in evaluating our safety and ultimately driving decision-making. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=841.057s">Our</a>  second recommendation would be a recommendation to approve, would be our hope that as we update part two, the Medford community health metrics of the original Medford Public Schools COVID-19 reopening dashboard to include DPHs updated color-coded classification system. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=862.707s">And</a>  so, in closing again, we are not recommending to overhaul everything that was approved on 1014 all the collaborative work the meetings that took place in the science lab the science wing and zoom meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=878.863s">to</a>  come up with our original NPS dashboard, reopening dashboard. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=885.347s">But</a>  we are asking that we look at part two and accept the updated color-coded classification system from the Department of Public Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=897.755s">And</a>  I look forward to hearing your questions and comments from the team and responding to those questions this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=909.042s">I</a>  also would like to say that members of the team, Dr. Cushing, Dave Murphy, Nurse Toni Ray, I think Marian O'Connor for the Board of Health, and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=921.706s">Suzanne</a>  Galussi and or Joan Bowen, we will be more than happy to respond to any questions this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=930.288s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=935.409s">Thank</a>  you for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=936.53s">Member</a>  Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=956.084s">There</a>  we go, thank you, I couldn't unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=959.186s">Thank</a>  you for the presentation, I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=961.888s">I</a>  just wanted to disagree slightly with something that was just said that the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education is being more conservative. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=971.356s">When</a>  I read the CDC guidelines in bold, they say that their indicators are dependent upon the implementation of school and community mitigation strategies. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=985.031s">DESE</a>  does not have that dependency. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=988.392s">All</a>  measures make no sense at all without, according to CDC, if you don't have a quality implementation of the school and community mitigation strategies, then the other measures are sort of unimportant. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1003.556s">DESE</a>  just seems to be okay with just numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1006.676s">So</a>  I think that the CDC guidance is definitely far more conservative in that regard. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1014.237s">So</a>  that's sort of where I want to go in our conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1018.678s">I</a>  won't just do all the talking, but I need to understand better our contact tracing. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1027.92s">There's</a>  three pieces to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1029.221s">There's</a>  the testing, there's the contact tracing, and then, of course, the isolation. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1033.922s">And</a>  I feel like the testing is sort of a moot point. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1038.883s">None</a>  of us can control. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1039.943s">I</a>  know the mayor is working to get more testing and to get <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1043.462s">students</a>  tested and that'll be good. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1046.144s">But</a>  all of that is simply a proxy for the assumption that we have a random surveillance testing of our community and that doesn't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1054.03s">But</a>  contact tracing to me seems like the big elephant in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1059.814s">I</a>  don't have metrics that tell me how good ours is, how fast it is, if we have enough staff, how much contact tracing could our staff do before we run out of hours in the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1069.842s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1072.258s">You</a>  know, the CDC is clear, metrics are dependent, meaning literally everything above that must be based on a implementation of school and community mitigation strategies. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1085.782s">So</a>  I feel that that's the necessary part that we need to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1089.664s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1092.945s">Thank</a>  you, Member Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1104.837s">So</a>  if I were to respond in terms of the contact tracing that's taking place right now, it is our nursing department. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1114.04s">And</a>  I want to just acknowledge nurse Toni Wray and acknowledge once again, Marianne O'Connor. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1120.542s">The</a>  work that we've been doing since school has opened is not a Monday to Friday schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1126.464s">We're</a>  also working on weekends, closely monitoring the activity that's happening in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1132.166s">And</a>  so I do want to thank <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1134.442s">the</a>  entire nursing department and the board of health for how they have truly partnered with us in terms of helping us get information quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1144.269s">And</a>  so for the nine positive cases that have happened since September, thankfully we have been able to <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1152.735s">do</a>  contact tracing, reach out to those families and reach out to the individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1159.401s">All</a>  of the contact tracing is done through the nursing department at the respective schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1166.707s">And</a>  so whether it's students or staff that are helping to provide the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1174.493s">And</a>  so what I can speak to is <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1177.69s">The</a>  contact tracing that is happening and that has taken place, we've responded and acted appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1183.835s">Again,</a>  as I said earlier, we know that dealing with each case on an individualized basis, that there is a nuance and it does require some flexibility, but we have always, always maintained safety as a priority, not only for the students, but also for the staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1203.048s">And</a>  so out of an abundance of caution, we've always taken a more aggressive stance. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1207.87s">And</a>  so through contact tracing, if that required additional quarantining, we have always done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1214.172s">So</a>  I can't speak to how the contact tracing is done, but I can say that the nurses, the nursing department, they've been trained, all that are doing it, they're working in collaboration with the board of health, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1231.156s">and</a>  have received the same training that the Board of Health staff have received, which is an agreement with the Department of Health of how contact tracing should take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1241.898s">And</a>  at this point in time, it has been manageable for the district, given the level of positivity that we've had as a district. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1252.861s">Again,</a>  I will qualify it by saying at this point in time.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1258.762s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Edward-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1260.848s">Member</a>  Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1263.108s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1263.528s">I</a>  don't want to let the other members have questions, but so I just had a set of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1267.409s">I'll</a>  just start to do a few and then let other people speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1272.59s">How</a>  many contact tracers do we have for the school system and the city adjusted for FTEs? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1279.171s">Because</a>  I know the nurses are not full-time contact tracers.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1287.733s">All</a>  contact tracing happening at the school <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1290.657s">happens</a>  with the entire nursing staff at their respective buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1298.642s">So</a>  there were nurses at all of the schools and Toni Wray also oversees that and keeps a separate database to track all of the activity that is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1315.693s">And</a>  it is eventually reported out to, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1320.843s">the</a>  department as well.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1322.924s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1323.304s">What's</a>  the software we're using to track contacts?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1327.367s">MAVEN</a>  is the name of the program that the state requires cities and towns to use.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1334.711s">So</a>  our nurses are all accessing MAVEN. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1337.072s">They're</a>  entering individual contacts, indicating whether they've followed up with them, the whole nine yards.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1343.776s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1343.996s">O'Connor,</a>  if you're on, you can, thanks.</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1348.499s">So</a>  we have <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1351.198s">three</a>  school nurses right now currently on Maven. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1354.72s">The</a>  school contact tracing happens in collaboration with the Board of Health and the school nurses. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1361.484s">So</a>  that's the contact tracing done within the school building itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1366.346s">Any</a>  information is then transferred into Maven. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1370.128s">So</a>  these cases, what happens with the schools a lot of the time is these cases of self-reporting before we even see them in Maven. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1379.938s">So</a>  then we're getting the call from the school nurse or from Tony saying this child has this mother call, this child has test positive or the mother has it or the father has it. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1389.764s">And</a>  then they start their immediate contact tracing within the school building. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1394.267s">The</a>  information they gather, if they're not currently on MAVEN is then given to my staff and resubmitted into MAVEN. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1402.472s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1402.852s">Yeah,</a>  definitely.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1405.474s">So</a>  how does the nurse, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1408.158s">within</a>  a building do contact tracing for a student that is not in the school building?</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1414.58s">I'm</a>  not sure what you're asking, Sagan.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1417.341s">So</a>  my kids are both full remote. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1419.281s">If</a>  one of them becomes positive, how does the nurse at their school do contact tracing?</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1425.043s">So</a>  if they're remote, it typically would fall back onto the Board of Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1430.985s">The</a>  nurses are calling them. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1435.019s">The</a>  school nurses are calling those families, I believe, and following up with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1439.68s">But</a>  if they're not within the school building, then the contact tracing doesn't have to happen in the school building. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1444.141s">It's</a>  more of a community contact tracing at that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1446.821s">And</a>  that's when we call and we find out it's from the household. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1450.582s">Mom</a>  had it, brought it home or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1455.023s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1455.503s">I'll</a>  ask one more and then let other people talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1458.764s">So</a>  how many cases can you contact trace before you're out of capacity?</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1465.662s">We</a>  keep going until we can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1467.963s">So</a>  you have to understand the cases come in 24 seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1471.404s">They</a>  don't come in just nine to five. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1473.285s">So</a>  we will get them whenever, as soon as we wake up in the morning, you get the ones that came in from midnight on and you start working on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1482.589s">We</a>  are onboarding because of the search that we're currently in. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1486.17s">We</a>  are actually onboarding five more contact tracers this week, hopefully, to keep up with the demand because it is, yeah, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1494.403s">happens</a>  a lot of the time it's not easy as far as you know you make a phone call they pick it up and you're all it's sometimes it takes several calls to actually get through to someone and you know may take a day for them to call you back so it's it's various you can't really say you know this is every case takes so many minutes or hours or whatever it's all different.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1521.723s">And</a>  I think it's important to point out, there must be a timeframe, Miriam, that you can probably speak to on when the first call goes out from the Board of Health to a positive case. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1531.665s">And</a>  if there was ever a chance we needed more help with that, the state is providing contact traces. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1537.506s">So</a>  we do have that backup. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1538.786s">Although</a>  I don't think we've needed to use the state.</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1542.567s">I'm</a>  a little bit now lately with the searches, just particularly for the contacts, as opposed to the, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1549.598s">The</a>  positive case itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1551.539s">We</a>  were following up on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1553.18s">What</a>  we found recently like again it's mostly household transmission. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1557.441s">So</a>  it's easy when you make that first call to the to the actual case. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1561.723s">They</a>  say I live with three other people, and you do the contact tracing right there and then on the phone because it's the household transmission. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1569.406s">But</a>  so the state does have what's called the CTC and now they're picking up twice a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1577.094s">So</a>  I believe it's like two and I wanna say 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1580.497s">So</a>  if we have gotten new cases in and haven't gotten to those cases by two or 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1585.202s">that</a>  day, the CTC automatically grabs them and does the follow-up on them.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1599.365s">I</a>  can't put the other one with questions, but I have more. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1601.245s">I</a>  can just keep going.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1605.186s">Yep,</a>  keep going. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1605.866s">And</a>  any member that has a question during can always raise their hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1609.287s">I've</a>  got my eyes open.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1610.927s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1612.107s">So</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1613.188s">O'Connor,</a>  on the CDC website, there's a whole page called Evaluating Case Investigation and Contact Tracing Success that recommends a long list of canned reports to evaluate how <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1627.305s">the</a>  number and percentage of contacts that are being interviewed within 24 hours, the number of cases that are closed in a period. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1635.67s">I</a>  won't go through the list because it's a substantial list. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1639.412s">Are</a>  we doing, are we actually creating those reports? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1644.995s">And</a>  I don't know if those would come out of MAVEN or if MAVEN is even designed to handle this stuff, but the, you know, I read through every one of the, I don't know, 30, 40, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1657.933s">recommended</a>  reports for evaluating our success. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1663.176s">And</a>  I couldn't find any that didn't seem really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1667.338s">I</a>  suppose that's why they're on the CDC website.</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1670.92s">So</a>  that's a yes or no question as far as MAVEN goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1675.322s">So</a>  I can run reports out of MAVEN. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1679.044s">I</a>  can run open cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1681.625s">I</a>  can run closed cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1683.887s">I</a>  can see when they were put into MAVEN. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1687.304s">as</a>  opposed to when we were able to pick them up, contact them directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1691.728s">Again,</a>  do I know that's because the nurse didn't get through for a day? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1696.914s">No,</a>  I could never tell you that out of Maven. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1699.616s">Or</a>  do I know that's because they just didn't get to it? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1705.402s">I</a>  can't tell you that out of Maven. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1706.863s">Maven's</a>  very limited in what you can get in and get out. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1712.788s">So,</a>  so the answer is, you know, yes, we're keeping an eye on those things and yes, we'll follow up and I can look into Maven and I can see what's outstanding and what's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1723.133s">And</a>  then it's just a matter of, I need to, I follow up sometimes directly with my public health nurse or whatever and say, how come this person hasn't been contacted or what's going on with this person? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1733.139s">And</a>  that's when I'll hear, well, I left five messages, you know, and they haven't called me back or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1737.981s">So</a>  I don't, does that answer your question?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1742.718s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, you know, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1744.399s">MAVEN</a>  probably wasn't designed to answer this very large set of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1748.223s">So</a>  I'm not surprised.</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1750.244s">Yeah,</a>  MAVEN was originally designed and we've been using MAVEN forever for all infectious disease. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1754.888s">It's</a>  the state infectious disease reporting software. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1758.731s">So</a>  it was not designed specifically for COVID and they're trying to add additional fields and add additional, you know, information. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1769.26s">But</a>  even like when they ask about <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1772.48s">You</a>  know, is it indoor dining? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1774.021s">Is</a>  it going to the gym? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1775.582s">What</a>  is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1776.003s">What's</a>  happening with it? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1777.264s">There</a>  is no specific data field in MAVEN. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1780.186s">You'd</a>  have to go through every individual nurse's notes to read. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1785.51s">So</a>  it's not easily accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1787.431s">You</a>  can't pull it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1788.032s">Now</a>  the state is adding that data field, I believe, the employment and other features like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1795.317s">So</a>  it might make it a little easier going forward.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1798.599s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1799.16s">So</a>  I had a question for the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1802.895s">How</a>  do you know that contact tracing is happening 100% of the time for the students?</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1812.668s">I</a>  could only speak to the nine students. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1816.397s">that</a>  we have the data for right now that once we're notified, whether it's by the parent notifying the school or we're given the information from the board of health calling the school department to say we have a student and their test results came in positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1837.605s">Once</a>  we are given that information, the next steps are that <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1842.547s">the</a>  school-based nurses would begin the process of contact tracing. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1849.653s">That's</a>  the information that I have for you for right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1853.076s">But</a>  that's what we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1855.878s">And</a>  once we have the information, it's given to the Board of Health, if it's done on the school side, and then it's entered into <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1864.338s">the</a>  MAVEN system. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1865.678s">And</a>  I think depending on the individual, whether it's an adult, depending on the individual or depending on the information that you're given as possible close contacts, they follow the appropriate steps.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1885.623s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1886.824s">One</a>  of the slides we have, which I don't, there's that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1891.565s">One</a>  of the slides in the slide deck <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1895.89s">Excuse</a>  me. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1897.09s">Oh,</a>  I'm sorry, not that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1899.291s">Too</a>  many slides, not that many really. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1902.012s">The</a>  COVID-19 positive case count that you showed, I guess one of the things that was confusing to me was that all hybrid kids are also remote kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1914.916s">And</a>  so I felt like this should actually be adjusted for days of in-school <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1922.792s">versus</a>  days not in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1924.872s">I</a>  mean, we have hybrid kids when we send whole classrooms or cohorts home because of an infection, they don't suddenly show up on the remote group. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1933.914s">They're</a>  still hybrid kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1935.574s">So</a>  I just find these, you know, nine total for hybrid, nine out of how many kids? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1943.796s">And</a>  out of how many days in school? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1946.956s">Because</a>  every hybrid kid is also a remote kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1950.057s">So,</a>  I mean, these numbers are, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1952.862s">certainly</a>  important, but they don't provide any context or scale. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1956.863s">I</a>  mean, if we had 18 remote kids in all, and all the rest of the kids were hybrid, then, I mean, DCF would probably be involved if literally every remote kid was positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1968.625s">But</a>  we don't, these numbers imply that twice as many kids who are remote are becoming infected, but that doesn't tell you that twice, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1981.452s">what</a>  percentage of the kids are actually remote versus hybrid. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1986.115s">And</a>  the hybrid kids, we have the hybrid kids that are not in yet, they're in cohort that is considered hybrid.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1994.281s">So</a>  right now we have approximately 1,700 kids in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1999.985s">Of</a>  those 1,700 students, whether they're cohort A, B or C, of those 1,700, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2006.877s">that</a>  are coming in for in-person instruction two days a week or four days a week, nine of those students have tested positive since the start of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2018.643s">So</a>  since September 16th, nine students tested positive of the 1,700 that, approximately 1,700 that are in school right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2030.87s">And</a>  we have another 900 or so that are online once we <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2037.078s">have</a>  our remaining high school students join the fold. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2040.339s">So</a>  of the 1,700 students that have come into Medford Public Schools, whether it's four days a week and you were part of cohort A, two days a week if you were part of cohort B, or two days a week and you were part of cohort C, from those three cohorts since September, we have had nine students test positive in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2065.49s">During</a>  that same time frame from September until now, students that are in cohort D, the fully remote cohort, we have had 18 students test positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2080.995s">for</a>  COVID-19. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2083.497s">So</a>  of the approximately 1300 students that have officially or students that have officially selected remote, a fully remote program, they make up those 18 students <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2100.97s">are</a>  from Cohort D. So, where you were saying the nine students, is it a Cohort A student or a Cohort B if they were in school Monday, Tuesday or in school Thursday, Friday, they're all classified <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2117.353s">for</a>  the purposes of just that table, so that people can't figure it out, I guess, but for the purposes of that table, if they come into Medford Public Schools for in-person instruction, at this point in time, nine students tested positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2135.02s">I</a>  hope that provides a- It does, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2138.961s">But</a>  I guess my question was, the eighth graders were the last group in, well, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2145.089s">Let's</a>  just take the eighth grades, for instance, who just one of the last middle school, one of the last groups to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2151.212s">They</a>  have been in cohort B or C since school started. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2157.596s">So</a>  if I'm an eighth grader and I tested positive in the middle of September, I am a hybrid kid who tested positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2167.341s">I</a>  was nowhere near a building because I wasn't starting for weeks and weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2171.984s">So</a>  I just wanna know that the nine <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2174.783s">truly</a>  only means kids that have actually gone to the school building, or are we just simply dividing by cohorts, in which case this doesn't actually, this doesn't help us understand, does going to school have any impact?</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2191.85s">The</a>  nine students that are listed, those are the nine students that were physically crossed the threshold and entered one of the Medford public school buildings for in-person instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2206.176s">And</a>  while they were receiving in-person instruction or it may have been a cohort B child that <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2216.082s">tested</a>  positive on a cohort C day, but they're still classified as a student that's attending and participating in instruction as cohort A, B, or C, then that's the student that was counted. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2232.408s">Point</a>  of information.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2234.508s">So</a>  just for, may I, ma'am?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2236.947s">Point</a>  of information, member McLaughlin, and then member Van der Kloot has her hand up as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2240.51s">Oh,</a>  I'm sorry, member Van der Kloot.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2241.851s">No,</a>  you have a point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2243.372s">So</a>  just if I understand you correctly, the nine students are students who physically crossed the threshold and went into the building, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2255.302s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2255.822s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2256.243s">And</a>  the 18 are students who have not yet physically crossed the threshold and gone into the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2261.927s">Is</a>  that accurate?</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2263.433s">Yes,</a>  that's my understanding, that the 18 students that are listed as remote are our remote-only students, and the nine were students that were physically on campus at one point in time.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2279.52s">Or</a>  to member Rousseau's point, point of information, or to member Rousseau's point, the 18 could be an aggregate of students who are in, say, cohort B or C, but had not yet gone into the hybrid physical threshold model yet because they were at the time remote, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2299.215s">That</a>  is a, I mean, I don't have the actual list of- Right, so the point of information is basically whenever the students were tested positive, they are in these two buckets. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2310.829s">They</a>  had either nine been in the building or 18 had not been in the building at the point of testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2316.896s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2317.877s">Yes,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2323.89s">Member</a>  van de Kloot?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2325.132s">Yes,</a>  so I just wanted to go back to Mary Ann if I could, or Tony, I don't know who better to ask this question. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2332.22s">So</a>  all together there we have 27 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2335.523s">When</a>  the contact tracers call their home, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2338.967s">Is</a>  it generally, like of the 27, do they know where they were in contact with someone with COVID? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2348.65s">Do</a>  they have certainty of the, like you mentioned, well, the father had it or the mother, or do you have people saying, I have no idea?</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2358.152s">Both,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2359.513s">We</a>  do have people who say, I work from home remote, like if the father gets it. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2363.554s">I</a>  work from home remotely. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2365.334s">We</a>  haven't done anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2367.495s">You</a>  know, one of them, one of the remote children that sticks out in my head, that both parents worked home remote, the child's home remote. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2376.28s">They</a>  said, the only thing that we do, we know that we do is we go to the playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2380.763s">But,</a>  you know, other than that, so it's some people can say, yes, I was exposed to a coworker. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2387.847s">So</a>  some people it's easier, but a lot of people give us that answer of, I don't <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2393.199s">have</a>  any idea how I could have gotten this.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2395.52s">Do</a>  you follow up and ask them if they've been going to the grocery store and other specifics?</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2400.201s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2400.901s">And</a>  obviously, most of them do go out and about and do what they need to do as far as errands go. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2406.843s">But</a>  there's no way that they would say, I know I got it at the grocery store.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2411.164s">So</a>  of the students, of the 27 students, if we could talk about in-school transmission, how many of those are suspected to be in-school transmission?</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2422.359s">Right</a>  now we've only had one of those students. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2425.841s">One</a>  of those students isn't in school transmission. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2428.843s">The</a>  other eight, we are clear that it was not in school transmission because it was from a household member who had previously already had it.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2439.338s">So</a>  in the in-school transmission case, and I realize we don't obviously wanna identify anybody, but how was it determined that that student, did they come to school sick? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2456.088s">Could</a>  you just give us a better understanding?</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2459.37s">So</a>  the only way we determine in-school transmission is because of the first case we had identified the close contacts <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2468.438s">we</a>  had put those close contacts into quarantine and then it was one of those close contacts who then became positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2475.882s">So</a>  that's why we are saying that we assume it was from his close contact that he became positive and it was in school.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2482.005s">Okay,</a>  thank you, Maria.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2483.005s">Thank</a>  you, member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2493.791s">And</a>  then member McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2497.405s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2498.686s">I'm</a>  looking at the chart and I just want to make, I think this chart deserves some definitions around remote and hybrid because I think as people look at this, you know, to look at September, it sounds great until you realize that a very small number of children went to school for three days in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2519.6s">So</a>  it's good that there was no transmission, but like the even chance of that was very, very low because our <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2526.946s">our</a>  cohort A didn't come back until September 28th, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2531.007s">And</a>  so I think what is complex about what we are doing here is we have students who have chosen hybrid who are still at home, and then we have remote students. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2543.63s">And</a>  so when we say it's remote students, I want people to just be clear about who is in that category. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2550.732s">So</a>  for example, like the question that I had based on some of the conversation we've been having is in October, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2556.363s">Medford</a>  High School, which in October only Cohort A was in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2561.728s">There</a>  were three students who tested positive who are hybrid and six who tested positive who are remote. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2569.114s">Does</a>  that mean that those three students were from Cohort A and the six <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2576.009s">were</a>  everybody else, or does it mean that the three include students who chose hybrid, but are still home because the high school has not welcomed students back. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2589.241s">And</a>  the six is among those students who have chosen to stay remote. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2594.486s">So</a>  I think that October line for the high school feels like the place where we can clearly sort of define this. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2603.02s">because</a>  it's uncomplicated in that we were not rolling students in in the month of October. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2611.684s">So</a>  I don't think that it's crystal clear, certainly not on this chart, what these categories mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2620.228s">And</a>  I think it can and should be clear as we publish this data.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2629.532s">So</a>  what you're asking, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2632.623s">is</a>  that the October data that reflected the remote students to go and confirm that those six students truly were on the fully remote list or were they students that were waiting for their particular grade level to come into school as part of the staggered hybrid. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2656.175s">So</a>  to possibly have a third column of remote <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2661.062s">waiting</a>  for, waiting to matriculate to in-person instruction is what it sounds like you're saying that.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2668.486s">I'm</a>  asking, yeah, I'm asking which way we are interpreting these headers. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2675.33s">And</a>  I think the reason it's relevant is because if you're going to start moving students across the line, so to speak, the data gets really hard to digest and interpret, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2688.197s">So</a>  if somebody, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2691.082s">is</a>  on the right side of the line today, but when we welcome them back now they're on the left side of the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2696.604s">I</a>  don't know that that is as helpful as if we had clarity about, you know, the students who are in and maybe it is as simple as having three columns like you're suggesting, but I just, I want the definitions, whether it's two columns or three columns to be really clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2715.079s">and</a>  unchanging. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2715.98s">So</a>  when we talk about our population, we can be clear about what the population is and means as we look at the number of four to conclude is four good or four not good based on that population.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2733.111s">Point</a>  of information? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2739.274s">Member</a>  Grims, finish, you're up next anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2742.056s">Member</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2744.577s">Oh,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2746.219s">So</a>  I think what I'm hearing is that I think that it's an interesting point in terms of to the sort of denominator, if you will, of the number and the data so that, for example, if there are, you know, three students that were tested positive in <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2765.838s">and</a>  we know that the denominator there was 100 students total, so three out of 100 students total, because those were the students that had been across the threshold in that point, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2779.464s">So</a>  I think that if I'm understanding correctly, the denominator is helpful as well, so that three out of 100 is very different from eight out of 1,700, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2791.209s">So</a>  I think that sort of denominator can be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2793.771s">So</a>  maybe it's either, again, the denominator or some percentages that help clarify that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2799.315s">But</a>  then I would also ask if I might, Marianne O'Connor, I don't see you, where are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2807.341s">Oh,</a>  there you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2808.241s">Hi,</a>  Marianne. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2811.344s">Can</a>  you, just, you know, at the risk of being a little bit pedantic, would you mind just sort of sharing your, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2820.243s">background,</a>  how long you've been doing this, sort of, you know, you know, what your role is, you know, just a little bit for especially for people who don't know, I would ask that. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2829.551s">And</a>  then I would ask whether you think that this is a reasonable plan moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2834.335s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2836.637s">So,</a>  as of August, I've been with Medford as the director of the Board of Health for four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2843.682s">Prior</a>  to that, I was in Lynn, I was the director of the Board of Health in Lynn for <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2850.15s">12</a>  years. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2851.451s">And</a>  prior to that, I was a vice president of a hospital system in healthcare. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2860.714s">So</a>  for many years, I'm showing my age. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2867.196s">What</a>  was the other question? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2867.957s">I'm</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2871.464s">The</a>  other question, is it your professional opinion that this plan that is being proposed by the central administration is a plan that should go forward?</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2886.007s">I</a>  do, because I think we're not looking at any one particular metric to move us. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2893.549s">Like</a>  they had said, it's a combination. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2895.649s">There's</a>  a lot of variation you have to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2898.349s">what's</a>  happening in the schools, but you have to look at what's happening in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2903.212s">So</a>  I think, you know, if we had an outbreak, God forbid, at one of our long-term care facilities again, our TAS or something, you know, we would have to look at that as a cluster that's separate and doesn't impact our schools, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2915.478s">Even</a>  though it may impact our numbers and our positivity rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2918.68s">So</a>  I think knowing that we're being nimble in what we do, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2925.126s">But</a>  at the same time, we're looking at the whole picture and we're not saying this is the one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2930.347s">There</a>  is no silver bullet, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2932.428s">If</a>  there was, we would have done that a long time ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2936.149s">So</a>  I think looking at the total picture, I think the plan that they're presenting is sound, very sound.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2945.811s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2947.952s">Member</a>  Kreatz, then Member Graham.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2953.092s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2954.093s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2954.473s">I</a>  just got my mic on. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2955.874s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2956.715s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2957.835s">So,</a>  thank you very much for the presentation, Dr. Edward Bitson and your entire staff, and a special thanks to Toni Wray and Marian O'Connor for everything that they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2969.243s">So</a>  I've been, you know, following the news and <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2971.885s">you</a>  know, listening to a lot of the emails and all the correspondence, you know, the public health experts, the desi commissioner, and the governor have expressed in light of the current COVID cases, students should be in school in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2985.662s">And</a>  I trust the medical professionals, health experts, the Board of Health, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2991.308s">and</a>  the State Board of Health and the CDC. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2993.509s">And,</a>  you know, I just, I really trust the experts. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2997.79s">You</a>  know, I know there's the COVID numbers are on the rise, but from everything that's been presented, the spread has been, you know, there has been very little spread in transmission in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3009.854s">And</a>  the spread has been related to either, you know, community and or family or indoor outings, you know, and we have said many times that the schools are very safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3019.937s">Um,</a>  you know what I what I'd like to do is I'd like to make a motion to accept the superintendent's recommendations continue with The to utilize parts one building classroom readiness and three district and school specific metrics from the original member public schools Reopening dashboard and then update part two member community health metrics Of the original member public schools covid reopening dashboard to include the department of public health's updated color-coded <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3049.117s">classification</a>  system. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3050.858s">So</a>  I just want to, you know, I want to definitely make that motion because I think that, you know, from hearing from all the experts and, you know, I just have to put my trust in the experts, the Department of Health, the Board of Health, the State Department of Health, the CDC, the governor, all their guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3068.529s">And,</a>  you know, I think we should continue to monitor <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3071.861s">you</a>  know, the numbers and pay very close attention, like what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3078.024s">And</a>  I'm just making that motion now.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3091.932s">I</a>  have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3092.592s">Friendly</a>  amendment.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3093.173s">I'm</a>  not ready to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3095.054s">Me</a>  either.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3096.154s">Can</a>  I make a friendly amendment? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3098.856s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3098.996s">Member</a>  McLaughlin and then Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3101.682s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3102.423s">The</a>  amendment that I was going to suggest is that the data include the information we were just talking about a little while ago with some clarification around the denominator number, if you will, and the sort of the cohort, that third column that we were talking about, just so that it's really clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3120.639s">And</a>  then obviously in the other <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3123.613s">that's</a>  not included in this particular document. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3125.273s">We</a>  had underneath each of the criteria we had, you know, remote or hybrid based on a different color criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3131.595s">I</a>  did see that that wasn't included in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3133.735s">Particular</a>  dashboard. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3134.856s">So</a>  if you could just add that to so that it's really explicit for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3138.817s">I</a>  think that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3139.797s">So</a>  I would just, you know, make a friendly amendment that that, um, data is included in the dashboard. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3145.558s">If</a>  member of</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3196.337s">OK,</a>  thank you, Dr. Cushing.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3207.125s">Hi,</a>  sorry, how about now?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3208.946s">Yes,</a>  we can hear you.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3210.387s">I</a>  hope my comment is worth the wait there, but the thing <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3221.272s">The</a>  thing that I wanted to say, and hopefully I'll be able to now without making everyone go deaf, is that with regard to this data, it can be disaggregated potentially with regard to the cohorts the way that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3234.754s">McLaughlin</a>  and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3235.595s">Graham</a>  have asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3236.995s">I</a>  just wanted to offer one point that you may want to take into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3243.316s">So</a>  when we look back, that is <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3246.813s">information</a>  that it's somewhat easy to disaggregate because as members were saying, if students have not yet come in, they're not cohort B or cohort C in the sense that we would think about them as cohort B and cohort C as in being in the school buildings and being exposed and potentially exposing members of the school community. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3269.217s">As</a>  we go forward, that issue should <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3275.708s">be</a>  of diminishing significance in the sense that we're only down to grades nine through 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3283.991s">And</a>  when we, presumably over the course of the next several weeks, and potentially a little bit longer, but hopefully several weeks, nine through 12 are in, and therefore there are no more students who are still pending their return to in-person instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3301.948s">However,</a>  there may be situations where either programs are transitioned into remote or theoretically, under very extreme circumstances, a school goes into remote. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3313.957s">At</a>  that point, this data, it would be that much more complicated to disaggregate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3321.003s">It</a>  doesn't mean we can't do that and we'll disaggregate any data that the committee wants to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3325.606s">But</a>  for community members' benefit, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3327.855s">when</a>  looking at this, they may not be able to draw the conclusions that you typically would expect to draw based on that variable changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3338.064s">And</a>  the fact that you could have someone who's B and C, but for some period of time is fully remote, they contract the virus, and then all of a sudden they're being counted in an account that is misleading. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3349.933s">And</a>  so again, we'll disaggregate any data that we can that you'd like us to, but you should know that <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3357.172s">The</a>  unintended consequence might be additional confusion rather than clarity. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3361.855s">And</a>  again, I apologize for if that wasn't worth the weight as I scrambled around my various computers here.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3402.911s">Yeah,</a>  I was going to say in terms of the colors, when I think about the original metrics, when the metrics technical team met and we looked at the specific scenarios and cases by schools, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3418.17s">all</a>  of that information that the group worked on at that point in time, we have not strayed away from those recommended scenarios. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3428.153s">So</a>  that if at one of the elementary schools, which currently has approximately 250 students, you know, whether it's cohort B day, AB or AC, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3442.737s">if</a>  you were to end up with, you know, like six cases or six students testing, you know, throughout in different classrooms, six different classrooms, we would do what we've been doing all along. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3454.943s">If</a>  it's within a classroom, we would, you know, isolate or quarantine the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3460.286s">But</a>  once we hit that number, we would revert back to what was stated in that document. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3467.689s">So</a>  if the magic number <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3469.763s">was</a>  six students, then that would be the number, that would be the number that we would work with to say at, you know, I don't wanna say a school's name, but at so-and-so school, there were six positive cases within one day or two days as a result of, you know, a significant uptick <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3495.382s">at</a>  the school level, then we would, you know, make that appropriate decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3500.326s">But</a>  thus far, we haven't had a situation where we've had multiple <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3508.169s">cases</a>  in one specific building, which was why we just wanted to show the data that we have at this point in time, where for October and for November, four students and five students over the course of an entire month, that's the data and spread out between four different schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3529.674s">So</a>  that's the reasoning behind that.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3536.987s">I</a>  want to talk about section three in just a second, but my question is about section two. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3542.592s">So</a>  community health metrics. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3545.455s">In</a>  the original plan, red meant remote. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3550.66s">And</a>  I think what member McLaughlin was asking is, does red equal remote?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3557.561s">the</a>  governor has stated four weeks in red, then you need to evaluate whether you should go remote. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3564.926s">So</a>  red does not mean remote.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3568.408s">It</a>  does not, red does not mean remote.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3572.07s">Okay,</a>  so- It doesn't mean per se remote.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3576.693s">Correct,</a>  it means somebody would need to make a decision, right?</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3581.576s">After</a>  extended period of time in red, but it does not mean, and really nothing means <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3586.926s">remote</a>  per se, or per se remote, depending on which teacher taught you that phrase. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3592.811s">But</a>  it is a combination of factors, which is sort of consistent with this overall criteria, that it is a totality of the circumstances analysis that takes into account these three prongs. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3607.804s">The</a>  readiness of the schools, which we can somewhat control, the community numbers at large, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3614.853s">and</a>  what's happening within the school communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3617.715s">And</a>  for none of those things, is there a single variable that would trigger the transition to remote? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3624.358s">Evaluating</a>  it in four weeks of remote that the governor stated, as the mayor just said, that would certainly happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3632.162s">But</a>  if we're deep into the red, we wouldn't wait to assess this until week four. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3637.205s">We</a>  would be assessing it on an ongoing basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3640.607s">And</a>  certainly after four weeks, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3643.39s">there</a>  would need to be a deeper discussion, but the discussion would build because we have to be vigilant about this and be looking at this continuously. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3651.797s">But</a>  there is, I think that for the community's benefit, they should know there is no single variable that will trigger a district wide transition to remote. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3660.163s">And</a>  the reason for that is everything has to be weighed together under the totality of the circumstances and at different points, different prongs will be weighed more heavily.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3668.83s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3670.187s">So</a>  that's what I thought this was actually saying, but it doesn't say that explicitly. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3676.349s">And</a>  I think it's important for the community to understand explicitly that our color status from the state does not mean we must do anything in our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3688.893s">So</a>  to put it on the chart, I think it's important, but I think it needs to include language that talks about the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3700.214s">These</a>  metrics are, there's nothing about this color coding that drives a decision automatically. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3709.499s">I</a>  think that needs to be clear on the document. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3714.021s">I</a>  also think it needs to be clear on the document what happens when we do sort of get to the point of having to make a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3723.825s">So</a>  when we end up in red, for example, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3729.868s">Like,</a>  does that mean that the superintendent is going to bring a recommendation in collaboration with the Board of Health to this committee where we will have a discussion and take a vote? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3745.161s">Or</a>  is this proposal saying you alone will make this decision?</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3756.472s">All</a>  the work that I have been doing has always been in collaboration with the team and in collaboration with guidance from the Board of Health and working closely with our Director of Nursing, Nurse Toni Rae. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3771.336s">If</a>  a decision like that, based on a shift in data, I would definitely communicate with the school committee as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3778.778s">It</a>  would be an emergency communication or a phone call, we would definitely communicate with you so I don't want the school committee to feel that they would not be looped in or notified of a significant shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3795.918s">We</a>  are closely looking at the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3798.139s">I</a>  believe strongly in data. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3799.519s">The</a>  data can do its own talking all by itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3803.18s">But</a>  if something like that were to happen, we would make a decision based on what the data is saying, but we would definitely include all stakeholders. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3814.323s">So</a>  if that were to be something where we needed, like back in, to say there's been a shift, the governor has said Massachusetts is no longer red, Massachusetts is now purple, and shutting down all schools, we would notify the school committee immediately, and we would call an emergency meeting and communicate first. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3841.705s">and</a>  in collaboration with the team, the board of health and share the information that we have so that the entire school committee would be kept abreast of what's happening.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3852.437s">So,</a>  and I appreciate that sort of if the governor says <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3857.854s">sort</a>  of hands down, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3859.015s">But</a>  I think what I'm getting at is there is a difference between you giving us a heads up of a decision that you've made and you asking this committee to collaborate on the best path forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3873.181s">I</a>  just wanna be clear what you are recommending tonight so that I can determine how I will vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3883.703s">So</a>  I wanna understand, are you going in those situations? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3887.386s">Are</a>  you coming to this committee where we will listen to the experts? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3892.791s">I</a>  don't believe anybody on this committee is suggesting that we not listen to the experts. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3896.494s">So</a>  I take complete exception to continued references that people are not listening to experts. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3902.179s">I</a>  think this committee wants to listen to the experts and has tried to do so pragmatically and carefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3908.901s">I</a>  do think that this is a decision that has wide impact on our community and the purpose of the school committee presiding over the schools is so that the entire community has a voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3921.708s">and</a>  a way to engage in what is really important to them as it relates to sending their children to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3930.295s">If</a>  you are making a decision and you are informing us, there is no collaboration or discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3936.861s">I'm</a>  not saying that is or isn't a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3940.524s">I'm</a>  just asking to be crystal clear what you are asking us to approve.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3945.648s">If</a>  I may, we took a vote as a committee to give the administration <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3950.542s">Maryann</a>  O'Connor and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3952.223s">Ray,</a>  that authority.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3954.985s">So-</a>  We gave them the authority to proceed with the staggered hybrid. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3960.668s">That</a>  is different than blanket authority forevermore. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3964.27s">I'm</a>  asking so that we are all clear about what and who and how we will make this decision.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3974.656s">Member</a>  Van de Kloop.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3976.864s">Yes,</a>  I actually am not done. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3978.484s">I</a>  was hoping for an answer to that question and I have several more.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3981.185s">I</a>  would think that the administration and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3988.146s">O'Connor</a>  and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3988.886s">Ray</a>  would be fully capable of making that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3993.267s">That's</a>  my personal opinion, but I'm sure the committee thinks has an individual opinion on that.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4000.708s">So</a>  when the motion asks us to approve this plan, what is this plan that we're approving in this regard?</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4008.471s">Can</a>  I make a point of information or information, Miss McLaughlin? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4012.156s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4012.537s">There's</a>  a couple of things that I want to sort of ask in response to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4019.42s">query</a>  really is, you know, are we getting any public participation on this call? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4025.564s">I</a>  would like to hear from community members, frankly, we do have a community member whose hand is raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4030.387s">And</a>  then I did see that Mr. Murphy just raised his hand as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4033.248s">So</a>  I'd like to sort of, I'm trying to really listen to everyone's perspective here and including member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4040.253s">So</a>  I wanna make sure that we're able to hear from community members as well.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4045.55s">let</a>  member Graham continue and then we have two hands raised as well as member Vandekloot did raise her hand so we'll take it in that order.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4055.761s">So</a>  in response to your first question, member Graham, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4061.64s">I'm</a>  gonna respond with a word that, and I don't want it to be taken out of context, but I am gonna say, I would like to ask the entire school committee to place their trust in me, that as a parent, as an educator of over 25 years, I am not trying to put anyone's life or health at risk, that I am gonna prioritize education <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4090.786s">I</a>  love school, and I'm very happy seeing kids in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4095.951s">At</a>  this point in time, we don't have the data to support shutting down or operating differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4105.78s">At</a>  this point in time, the data isn't there. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4107.661s">The</a>  numbers are not showing that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4109.761s">And</a>  a personal privilege.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4111.503s">I</a>  would, I would like to trust the school committee to be able to trust that I would be able to make a sound decision, but a personal privilege of information member Ruseau, actually, it's a point of personal privilege.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4125.098s">I</a>  every meeting, we are continuously the school committee members, all of us are being <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4132.512s">attacked,</a>  frankly, that we don't want schools open, that we don't trust the administration, that we don't trust the Board of Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4139.338s">And</a>  literally, if you want to go watch all those videos again, none of us are saying that. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4143.902s">It</a>  is offensive, and it's got to stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4146.264s">Either</a>  it's not a school committee member, and there's probably in this entire nation that doesn't want kids back in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4152.069s">And</a>  it's a drum that is being beat endlessly, and it is offensive.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4160.194s">Point</a>  of information, member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4162.036s">I</a>  have to say, you know, with all due respect to the chair I disagree with member Ruseau here. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4167.921s">I</a>  think that there's been a lot of emotion and a lot of heated back and forth on both parts, frankly, and I think that we really need to put the children first. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4176.948s">and</a>  not make this personal with anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4179.269s">So</a>  not school committee members, not the board of health, not the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4184.07s">I</a>  think we are all here trying our damnedest to do the best for every single one of our kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4188.292s">And</a>  I have to say, I think that the superintendent has been leading that charge and that has been, this is probably the most difficult job anybody has been in. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4196.875s">And</a>  I have to speak on that behalf and say, I don't think we should be making this personal. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4201.316s">I</a>  don't think anybody's attacking anybody or if they are, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4204.637s">request</a>  that we're not, and that we're really thinking about how we're all in this together, and we're really all trying to think about the best interest of all of our children.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4211.62s">Point</a>  of order.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4214.101s">Thank</a>  you, Member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4215.921s">Point</a>  of order, Member Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4217.402s">Points</a>  of personal privilege are not to be responded to. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4220.483s">I</a>  just wanted to reiterate that as part of Robert's rules.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4225.725s">Overruled.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4227.986s">Dr.</a>  Edouard-Vincent, would you like to finish? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4230.066s">And</a>  then I think Mr. Murphy wanted to</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4233.89s">Yes,</a>  as I was saying, I do trust my judgment and my experience that if I had to call school, if that was a decision that had to be made, I would make that decision, but in collaboration with feedback from my colleagues, listening to the guidance of the board of health and working closely with our director, Toni Wray of nursing. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4260.161s">I</a>  would also make it a point not after the fact to communicate early and clearly to the school committee that if we we saw a shift in the data, and that things were changing that that something possibly could be happening, I would. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4276.128s">make</a>  that commitment to get that message across to you as soon as it was something that seemed like it could be a decision that was going to be made in the near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4287.017s">But</a>  part of the responsibility of running the school district is to be able to make the difficult decisions <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4295.924s">and</a>  I know that I can call any of you, speak with you and bring it to you as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4302.665s">But</a>  it is part of what is expected of a superintendent and I am prepared to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4308.347s">I</a>  am prepared to make those difficult decisions if that were to need to happen.</p>
