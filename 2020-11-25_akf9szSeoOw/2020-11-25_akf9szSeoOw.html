    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=93.038s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=94.059s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=94.84s">Mr.</a>  Milucheski will be co-presenting this with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=100.084s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Milucheski. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=102.384s">So</a>  good evening, Mayor, Mayor Lungo-Koehn, members of the school committee, Mustang Nation, and our community at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=111.07s">This</a>  evening, I'm going to present to you our report on the MPS reopening, updating our COVID-19 reopening dashboard. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=124.358s">In</a>  the summer, there were three guiding pillars that led the work that we've done with school reopening. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=132.259s">And</a>  those pillars always were and continue to guide the work that we're doing today. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=137.163s">Safety,</a>  equity, and consistency. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=147.731s">Back</a>  in October, on October 14th of this school year, we had a school committee meeting where we approved, the school committee approved the Medford Public Schools COVID-19 Reopening Dashboard. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=162.985s">This</a>  dashboard defined our evaluation of safety and it's used as a guide for our decision-making between the educational models that Medford offers, both our hybrid and remote. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=177.831s">The</a>  dashboard outlines three prevailing safety evaluations. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=183.733s">The</a>  first one is building classroom readiness. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=188.177s">The</a>  second one, Medford community health metrics. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=192.5s">And</a>  the third area, district and school specific metrics. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=201.805s">On</a>  October 14th, or since that time, two things have changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=207.969s">One,</a>  our experience working with positive COVID-19 cases in our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=215.017s">And</a>  secondly, the Department of Public Health had introduced an updated color-coded metric to outline community COVID-19 risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=228.119s">So</a>  one thing that hasn't changed, and this is from the CDC, indicators should neither be used in isolation nor should they be viewed as hard cutoffs. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=242.922s">by</a>  school departments, school administration, by all making these kinds of decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=249.084s">Rather,</a>  they should serve as broad guideposts of inherent risk to inform decision-making. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=258.368s">In</a>  Medford public schools, each situation that we have encountered since the start of school has brought a level of nuance. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=269.301s">Each</a>  situation has required us to be responsive to the individual circumstances of each case. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=278.029s">Dealing</a>  with COVID-19, it has put us in a position where we must continue to be flexible because each situation is individualized. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=292.71s">Additional</a>  CDC guidance from Dr. Robert Redfield. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=296.411s">This</a>  was last week's guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=299.191s">I've</a>  listed a few quotes, but one that stood out to me was the truth is for kids K to 12, one of the safest places they can be from our perspective is to remain in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=317.921s">Some</a>  of this data and what the CDC is recommending and what Dr. Robert Redfield was talking about, it holds true for Medford and our Medford context. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=337.737s">So</a>  in Medford, we went through a collaborative process and through that collaborative process, we developed <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=346.447s">the</a>  metrics that are in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=349.748s">But</a>  in addition to that, we have a database or a spreadsheet that I'm gonna share with you, which shows our positive COVID-19 case count to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=365.452s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Malachewski. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=368.612s">If</a>  I just provide a quick overview, which shows the data for our students and employees, staff, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=376.772s">But</a>  in particular, since the start of the school year in September, Medford Public Schools has had nine students test positive that are participating in the hybrid model and 18 students test positive that are participating in the remote instruction model. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=399.984s">And</a>  so I just want to present these numbers because right now we have approximately 1,700 students in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=409.407s">And</a>  so in our context, at this particular point in time, I just wanted to stress that we have noticed that we have had limited in-school transmission. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=426.714s">At</a>  this point in time, I would like to have my colleague, Mr. Tom Mieliszewski, provide additional information about the metrics.</p>

    <p>[nnsRDJfWfaQ_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=438.244s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Edouard-Vincent, and good evening, Mayor Lungo-Koehn, and members of the Medford School Committee, and members of the Medford community. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=445.006s">It's</a>  nice to see you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=446.226s">So</a>  as Dr. Edouard-Vincent shared, I'm gonna talk about this second thing that has changed since October 14th, and our dashboard was approved, and that's this highlighted part number two here, DPH's updated color-coded metric to outline community COVID-19 risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=461.464s">Now,</a>  before I even talk about the shift, I would like to just make sure everyone's on the same page with sort of how this fits into our dashboard. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=470.25s">So</a>  I'm gonna show the COVID-19 dashboard that was approved on 10-14. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=475.194s">And</a>  you'll see that this is one of the three pieces that sort of how we evaluated safety was this DPH guidance, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=482.799s">So</a>  first being building classroom readiness. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=486.001s">Second</a>  being the Medford community health metrics, which here again using the Massachusetts Department of Public Health's color coded classification system. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=493.944s">And</a>  then third, our school district and school specific conditions where we looked at what is the transmission like in our schools, what do we do if there's one case here or two cases here and making those decisions at the specific school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=506.993s">So</a>  want to, before we dive into just the specifics around this shift, want to just emphasize that this is just, this Department of Public Health's color-coded classification system is just one of the variables that we're using to evaluate sort of safety and to guide our decision-making in terms of remote versus hybrid. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=525.7s">So</a>  with that said, nonetheless, there was a shift since this was approved back on October 14th. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=534.692s">I</a>  would like to quickly share with everyone what that shift looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=538.613s">So</a>  you'll see here, this is the new in the updated color code and classification system by the Department of Public Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=545.877s">And</a>  we should be looking in the far right column where it says over 50K given around 60,000 residents in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=553.301s">So</a>  you'll see that this color coded classification system brings in two variables. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=558.443s">First,</a>  the average case count per 100,000 people over the past two weeks, and also the percent positivity rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=566.345s">So</a>  we've looked at this a lot as a team and thought about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=569.246s">And</a>  we've also, as we thought about this sort of new classification system, we've also continued to look back at CDC guidance, which there is a, as you can imagine, a pretty strong alignment between guidance from the CDC and what we're seeing from DPH. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=585.91s">So</a>  you'll see here on the screen, this is a dashboard that was created by or titled CDC indicators and thresholds of risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=594.752s">which</a>  analyzes just the community prevalence of COVID and then the risk that that poses for transmission in schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=601.876s">You'll</a>  see here that this looks at two of the same variables that I just outlined. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=605.518s">If</a>  you look in the left column, number of new cases per 100,000 within the past 14 days, and also percent positivity, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=613.462s">So</a>  this system, right, or this dashboard is looking at two of the criteria that were also outlined here. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=620.436s">Now,</a>  internally, as we've kind of looked at this, we've played out several scenarios, and we're going to walk through one today, is if, say, using the CDC guidance, we were to have 19 positive cases in the last 14 days per 100,000 residents and be at 4.5% positivity rate, that would put us in this range of the green, of the lower risk of transmission in schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=649.384s">which</a>  is interesting when we compare that back to... <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=654.166s">sort</a>  of the DPH's guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=655.467s">If</a>  we had 19 positive cases per 100,000 in a four and a half percent positivity rate, that would put us in this bottom right quadrant right here in the red category. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=664.571s">So</a>  we share that to say that we have looked at like the alignment between sort of CDC and DPH. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=670.955s">We've</a>  also found that in our sort of, as we played out scenarios, that the DPH guidance has generally been more conservative than sort of the guidance from the CDC. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=682.155s">So</a>  sort of where does that bring us for now? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=684.436s">So</a>  what our recommendation and our proposal for tonight is that we update our dashboard to include the new color-coded classification system, which would look like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=698.023s">I'm</a>  gonna stop sharing my screen for a second and bring you into the actual dashboard. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=702.025s">So</a>  this was the dashboard that was approved <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=704.872s">back</a>  in the 14th of October, you'll see that it has the old sort of color coded classification system. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=711.596s">And</a>  what we're proposing for tonight is that we update this to have, again, the same number one around building classroom readiness. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=719.647s">update</a>  this number two to have the updated DPH guidance, and then keep this number three, which if you remember, this number three outlined specific scenarios in school related to if there's a positive case here or if there's a case in a cohort, if there's two cases in a cohort. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=735.831s">Our</a>  recommendation is to keep what the school committee had approved in numbers one and three, and right now just update this number two to now say using the Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=747.073s">Department</a>  of Public Health color-coded classification. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=749.934s">system.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=751.796s">Now</a>  as I should I want to go through just one other thing quickly which is last time in our last school committee member meeting there were some questions around Tufts and the numbers of how like Tufts impacts the Medford numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=764.264s">So</a>  we have been able to work with Tufts and we are able to pull out sort of Tufts data and compare that and think about what's the impact of including Tufts in our Medford data and also what's the impact of pulling those out. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=776.092s">And</a>  you see in a recent sort of two-week span from 10-28 to 11-11, with Tufts included, we're at a 0.96% positivity rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=784.195s">But</a>  if we pull Tufts out, we're at 1.1%. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=792.618s">So</a>  I think, you know, you could all decide about when and how would you want to pull Tufts out in certain circumstances and data analysis, but did just want to make it clear tonight that we do have the ability to pull Tufts out sort of as we're able to break down data. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=807.507s">So</a>  I know I quickly provided an overview of what our recommendations would be for tonight, but I want to turn it over to Dr. Edouard-Vincent, who's just going to provide that with a little bit more clarity, sort of on our final slide.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=818.61s">So</a>  our recommendations this evening are to continue to utilize parts one, building classroom readiness, and part three, district and school specific metrics from the original Medford Public Schools COVID-19 reopening dashboard as critical metrics in evaluating our safety and ultimately driving decision-making. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=841.057s">Our</a>  second recommendation would be a recommendation to approve, would be our hope that as we update part two, the Medford community health metrics of the original Medford Public Schools COVID-19 reopening dashboard to include DPHs updated color-coded classification system. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=862.707s">And</a>  so, in closing again, we are not recommending to overhaul everything that was approved on 1014 all the collaborative work the meetings that took place in the science lab the science wing and zoom meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=878.863s">to</a>  come up with our original NPS dashboard, reopening dashboard. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=885.347s">But</a>  we are asking that we look at part two and accept the updated color-coded classification system from the Department of Public Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=897.755s">And</a>  I look forward to hearing your questions and comments from the team and responding to those questions this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=909.042s">I</a>  also would like to say that members of the team, Dr. Cushing, Dave Murphy, Nurse Toni Ray, I think Marian O'Connor for the Board of Health, and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=921.706s">Suzanne</a>  Galussi and or Joan Bowen, we will be more than happy to respond to any questions this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=930.288s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=935.409s">Thank</a>  you for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=936.53s">Member</a>  Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=956.084s">There</a>  we go, thank you, I couldn't unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=959.186s">Thank</a>  you for the presentation, I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=961.888s">I</a>  just wanted to disagree slightly with something that was just said that the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education is being more conservative. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=971.356s">When</a>  I read the CDC guidelines in bold, they say that their indicators are dependent upon the implementation of school and community mitigation strategies. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=985.031s">DESE</a>  does not have that dependency. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=988.392s">All</a>  measures make no sense at all without, according to CDC, if you don't have a quality implementation of the school and community mitigation strategies, then the other measures are sort of unimportant. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1003.556s">DESE</a>  just seems to be okay with just numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1006.676s">So</a>  I think that the CDC guidance is definitely far more conservative in that regard. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1014.237s">So</a>  that's sort of where I want to go in our conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1018.678s">I</a>  won't just do all the talking, but I need to understand better our contact tracing. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1027.92s">There's</a>  three pieces to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1029.221s">There's</a>  the testing, there's the contact tracing, and then, of course, the isolation. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1033.922s">And</a>  I feel like the testing is sort of a moot point. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1038.883s">None</a>  of us can control. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1039.943s">I</a>  know the mayor is working to get more testing and to get <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1043.462s">students</a>  tested and that'll be good. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1046.144s">But</a>  all of that is simply a proxy for the assumption that we have a random surveillance testing of our community and that doesn't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1054.03s">But</a>  contact tracing to me seems like the big elephant in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1059.814s">I</a>  don't have metrics that tell me how good ours is, how fast it is, if we have enough staff, how much contact tracing could our staff do before we run out of hours in the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1069.842s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1072.258s">You</a>  know, the CDC is clear, metrics are dependent, meaning literally everything above that must be based on a implementation of school and community mitigation strategies. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1085.782s">So</a>  I feel that that's the necessary part that we need to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1089.664s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1092.945s">Thank</a>  you, Member Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1104.837s">So</a>  if I were to respond in terms of the contact tracing that's taking place right now, it is our nursing department. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1114.04s">And</a>  I want to just acknowledge nurse Toni Wray and acknowledge once again, Marianne O'Connor. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1120.542s">The</a>  work that we've been doing since school has opened is not a Monday to Friday schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1126.464s">We're</a>  also working on weekends, closely monitoring the activity that's happening in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1132.166s">And</a>  so I do want to thank <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1134.442s">the</a>  entire nursing department and the board of health for how they have truly partnered with us in terms of helping us get information quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1144.269s">And</a>  so for the nine positive cases that have happened since September, thankfully we have been able to <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1152.735s">do</a>  contact tracing, reach out to those families and reach out to the individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1159.401s">All</a>  of the contact tracing is done through the nursing department at the respective schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1166.707s">And</a>  so whether it's students or staff that are helping to provide the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1174.493s">And</a>  so what I can speak to is <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1177.69s">The</a>  contact tracing that is happening and that has taken place, we've responded and acted appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1183.835s">Again,</a>  as I said earlier, we know that dealing with each case on an individualized basis, that there is a nuance and it does require some flexibility, but we have always, always maintained safety as a priority, not only for the students, but also for the staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1203.048s">And</a>  so out of an abundance of caution, we've always taken a more aggressive stance. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1207.87s">And</a>  so through contact tracing, if that required additional quarantining, we have always done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1214.172s">So</a>  I can't speak to how the contact tracing is done, but I can say that the nurses, the nursing department, they've been trained, all that are doing it, they're working in collaboration with the board of health, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1231.156s">and</a>  have received the same training that the Board of Health staff have received, which is an agreement with the Department of Health of how contact tracing should take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1241.898s">And</a>  at this point in time, it has been manageable for the district, given the level of positivity that we've had as a district. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1252.861s">Again,</a>  I will qualify it by saying at this point in time.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1258.762s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Edward-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1260.848s">Member</a>  Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1263.108s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1263.528s">I</a>  don't want to let the other members have questions, but so I just had a set of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1267.409s">I'll</a>  just start to do a few and then let other people speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1272.59s">How</a>  many contact tracers do we have for the school system and the city adjusted for FTEs? <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1279.171s">Because</a>  I know the nurses are not full-time contact tracers.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1287.733s">All</a>  contact tracing happening at the school <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1290.657s">happens</a>  with the entire nursing staff at their respective buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1298.642s">So</a>  there were nurses at all of the schools and Toni Wray also oversees that and keeps a separate database to track all of the activity that is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1315.693s">And</a>  it is eventually reported out to, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1320.843s">the</a>  department as well.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1322.924s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1323.304s">What's</a>  the software we're using to track contacts?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1327.367s">MAVEN</a>  is the name of the program that the state requires cities and towns to use.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1334.711s">So</a>  our nurses are all accessing MAVEN. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1337.072s">They're</a>  entering individual contacts, indicating whether they've followed up with them, the whole nine yards.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1343.776s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1343.996s">O'Connor,</a>  if you're on, you can, thanks.</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1348.499s">So</a>  we have <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1351.198s">three</a>  school nurses right now currently on Maven. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1354.72s">The</a>  school contact tracing happens in collaboration with the Board of Health and the school nurses. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1361.484s">So</a>  that's the contact tracing done within the school building itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1366.346s">Any</a>  information is then transferred into Maven. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1370.128s">So</a>  these cases, what happens with the schools a lot of the time is these cases of self-reporting before we even see them in Maven. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1379.938s">So</a>  then we're getting the call from the school nurse or from Tony saying this child has this mother call, this child has test positive or the mother has it or the father has it. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1389.764s">And</a>  then they start their immediate contact tracing within the school building. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1394.267s">The</a>  information they gather, if they're not currently on MAVEN is then given to my staff and resubmitted into MAVEN. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1402.472s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1402.852s">Yeah,</a>  definitely.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1405.474s">So</a>  how does the nurse, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1408.158s">within</a>  a building do contact tracing for a student that is not in the school building?</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1414.58s">I'm</a>  not sure what you're asking, Sagan.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1417.341s">So</a>  my kids are both full remote. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1419.281s">If</a>  one of them becomes positive, how does the nurse at their school do contact tracing?</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1425.043s">So</a>  if they're remote, it typically would fall back onto the Board of Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1430.985s">The</a>  nurses are calling them. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1435.019s">The</a>  school nurses are calling those families, I believe, and following up with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1439.68s">But</a>  if they're not within the school building, then the contact tracing doesn't have to happen in the school building. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1444.141s">It's</a>  more of a community contact tracing at that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1446.821s">And</a>  that's when we call and we find out it's from the household. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1450.582s">Mom</a>  had it, brought it home or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1455.023s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1455.503s">I'll</a>  ask one more and then let other people talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1458.764s">So</a>  how many cases can you contact trace before you're out of capacity?</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1465.662s">We</a>  keep going until we can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1467.963s">So</a>  you have to understand the cases come in 24 seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1471.404s">They</a>  don't come in just nine to five. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1473.285s">So</a>  we will get them whenever, as soon as we wake up in the morning, you get the ones that came in from midnight on and you start working on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1482.589s">We</a>  are onboarding because of the search that we're currently in. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1486.17s">We</a>  are actually onboarding five more contact tracers this week, hopefully, to keep up with the demand because it is, yeah, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1494.403s">happens</a>  a lot of the time it's not easy as far as you know you make a phone call they pick it up and you're all it's sometimes it takes several calls to actually get through to someone and you know may take a day for them to call you back so it's it's various you can't really say you know this is every case takes so many minutes or hours or whatever it's all different.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1521.723s">And</a>  I think it's important to point out, there must be a timeframe, Miriam, that you can probably speak to on when the first call goes out from the Board of Health to a positive case. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1531.665s">And</a>  if there was ever a chance we needed more help with that, the state is providing contact traces. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1537.506s">So</a>  we do have that backup. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1538.786s">Although</a>  I don't think we've needed to use the state.</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1542.567s">I'm</a>  a little bit now lately with the searches, just particularly for the contacts, as opposed to the, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1549.598s">The</a>  positive case itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1551.539s">We</a>  were following up on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1553.18s">What</a>  we found recently like again it's mostly household transmission. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1557.441s">So</a>  it's easy when you make that first call to the to the actual case. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1561.723s">They</a>  say I live with three other people, and you do the contact tracing right there and then on the phone because it's the household transmission. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1569.406s">But</a>  so the state does have what's called the CTC and now they're picking up twice a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1577.094s">So</a>  I believe it's like two and I wanna say 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1580.497s">So</a>  if we have gotten new cases in and haven't gotten to those cases by two or 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1585.202s">that</a>  day, the CTC automatically grabs them and does the follow-up on them.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1599.365s">I</a>  can't put the other one with questions, but I have more. <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=1601.245s">I</a>  can just keep going.</p>
