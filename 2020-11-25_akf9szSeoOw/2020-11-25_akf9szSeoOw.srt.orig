25
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:52,280
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not listed, but we should do it.

26
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,521
[SPEAKER_11]: So if everybody may please rise.

27
00:00:55,643 --> 00:01:07,169
[SPEAKER_10]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

28
00:01:11,812 --> 00:01:12,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

29
00:01:14,393 --> 00:01:16,054
[SPEAKER_11]: I will turn it over to the administration.

30
00:01:16,114 --> 00:01:16,914
[SPEAKER_11]: I know Ms.

31
00:01:17,014 --> 00:01:23,878
[SPEAKER_11]: Marian O'Connor, our director of the Board of Health, is on or will be on very shortly.

32
00:01:27,494 --> 00:01:31,737
[SPEAKER_11]: But Dr. Edward Vincent, do we have somebody specifically that will be starting this slideshow?

33
00:01:32,198 --> 00:01:32,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

34
00:01:33,038 --> 00:01:33,339
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

35
00:01:34,059 --> 00:01:34,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

36
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Milucheski will be co-presenting this with me.

37
00:01:40,084 --> 00:01:41,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Milucheski.

38
00:01:42,384 --> 00:01:50,409
[SPEAKER_06]: So good evening, Mayor, Mayor Lungo Kern, members of the school committee, Mustang Nation, and our community at large.

39
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:59,275
[SPEAKER_06]: This evening, I'm going to present to you our report on the MPS reopening, updating our COVID-19 reopening dashboard.

40
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:11,283
[SPEAKER_06]: In the summer, there were three guiding pillars that led the work that we've done with school reopening.

41
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:16,622
[SPEAKER_06]: And those pillars always were and continue to guide the work that we're doing today.

42
00:02:17,163 --> 00:02:20,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Safety, equity, and consistency.

43
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:41,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Back in October, on October 14th of this school year, we had a school committee meeting where we approved, the school committee approved the Medford Public Schools COVID-19 Reopening Dashboard.

44
00:02:42,985 --> 00:02:56,690
[SPEAKER_06]: This dashboard defined our evaluation of safety and it's used as a guide for our decision-making between the educational models that Medford offers, both our hybrid and remote.

45
00:02:57,831 --> 00:03:02,433
[SPEAKER_06]: The dashboard outlines three prevailing safety evaluations.

46
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:07,415
[SPEAKER_06]: The first one is building classroom readiness.

47
00:03:08,177 --> 00:03:11,779
[SPEAKER_06]: The second one, Medford community health metrics.

48
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,442
[SPEAKER_06]: And the third area, district and school specific metrics.

49
00:03:21,805 --> 00:03:26,588
[SPEAKER_06]: On October 14th, or since that time, two things have changed.

50
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:33,432
[SPEAKER_06]: One, our experience working with positive COVID-19 cases in our schools.

51
00:03:35,017 --> 00:03:46,079
[SPEAKER_06]: And secondly, the Department of Public Health had introduced an updated color-coded metric to outline community COVID-19 risk.

52
00:03:48,119 --> 00:04:01,762
[SPEAKER_06]: So one thing that hasn't changed, and this is from the CDC, indicators should neither be used in isolation nor should they be viewed as hard cutoffs.

53
00:04:02,922 --> 00:04:08,604
[SPEAKER_06]: by school departments, school administration, by all making these kinds of decisions.

54
00:04:09,084 --> 00:04:16,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Rather, they should serve as broad guideposts of inherent risk to inform decision-making.

55
00:04:18,368 --> 00:04:27,632
[SPEAKER_06]: In Medford public schools, each situation that we have encountered since the start of school has brought a level of nuance.

56
00:04:29,301 --> 00:04:36,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Each situation has required us to be responsive to the individual circumstances of each case.

57
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:48,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Dealing with COVID-19, it has put us in a position where we must continue to be flexible because each situation is individualized.

58
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Additional CDC guidance from Dr. Robert Redfield.

59
00:04:56,411 --> 00:04:57,771
[SPEAKER_06]: This was last week's guidance.

60
00:04:59,191 --> 00:05:13,114
[SPEAKER_06]: I've listed a few quotes, but one that stood out to me was the truth is for kids K to 12, one of the safest places they can be from our perspective is to remain in school.

61
00:05:17,921 --> 00:05:31,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of this data and what the CDC is recommending and what Dr. Robert Redfield was talking about, it holds true for Medford and our Medford context.

62
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:44,983
[SPEAKER_06]: So in Medford, we went through a collaborative process and through that collaborative process, we developed

63
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:47,827
[SPEAKER_06]: the metrics that are in place.

64
00:05:49,748 --> 00:06:03,571
[SPEAKER_06]: But in addition to that, we have a database or a spreadsheet that I'm gonna share with you, which shows our positive COVID-19 case count to date.

65
00:06:05,452 --> 00:06:06,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Malachewski.

66
00:06:08,612 --> 00:06:15,494
[SPEAKER_06]: If I just provide a quick overview, which shows the data for our students and employees, staff,

67
00:06:16,772 --> 00:06:38,351
[SPEAKER_06]: But in particular, since the start of the school year in September, Medford Public Schools has had nine students test positive that are participating in the hybrid model and 18 students test positive that are participating in the remote instruction model.

68
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:48,586
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I just want to present these numbers because right now we have approximately 1,700 students in school.

69
00:06:49,407 --> 00:07:04,331
[SPEAKER_06]: And so in our context, at this particular point in time, I just wanted to stress that we have noticed that we have had limited in-school transmission.

70
00:07:06,714 --> 00:07:16,091
[SPEAKER_06]: At this point in time, I would like to have my colleague, Mr. Tom Mieliszewski, provide additional information about the metrics.

71
00:07:18,244 --> 00:07:24,485
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Dr. Edward Vincent, and good evening, Mayor Lungo Kern, and members of the Medford School Committee, and members of the Medford community.

72
00:07:25,006 --> 00:07:25,866
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice to see you all.

73
00:07:26,226 --> 00:07:39,809
[SPEAKER_01]: So as Dr. Edward Vincent shared, I'm gonna talk about this second thing that has changed since October 14th, and our dashboard was approved, and that's this highlighted part number two here, DPH's updated color-coded metric to outline community COVID-19 risk.

74
00:07:41,464 --> 00:07:50,230
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, before I even talk about the shift, I would like to just make sure everyone's on the same page with sort of how this fits into our dashboard.

75
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,493
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm gonna show the COVID-19 dashboard that was approved on 10-14.

76
00:07:55,194 --> 00:08:02,439
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll see that this is one of the three pieces that sort of how we evaluated safety was this DPH guidance, right?

77
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:04,960
[SPEAKER_01]: So first being building classroom readiness.

78
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:12,863
[SPEAKER_01]: Second being the Medford community health metrics, which here again using the Massachusetts Department of Public Health's color coded classification system.

79
00:08:13,944 --> 00:08:25,768
[SPEAKER_01]: And then third, our school district and school specific conditions where we looked at what is the transmission like in our schools, what do we do if there's one case here or two cases here and making those decisions at the specific school level.

80
00:08:26,993 --> 00:08:44,698
[SPEAKER_01]: So want to, before we dive into just the specifics around this shift, want to just emphasize that this is just, this Department of Public Health's color-coded classification system is just one of the variables that we're using to evaluate sort of safety and to guide our decision-making in terms of remote versus hybrid.

81
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:54,252
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that said, nonetheless, there was a shift since this was approved back on October 14th.

82
00:08:54,692 --> 00:08:57,676
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to quickly share with everyone what that shift looks like.

83
00:08:58,613 --> 00:09:05,156
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll see here, this is the new in the updated color code and classification system by the Department of Public Health.

84
00:09:05,877 --> 00:09:12,500
[SPEAKER_01]: And we should be looking in the far right column where it says over 50K given around 60,000 residents in Medford.

85
00:09:13,301 --> 00:09:17,803
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll see that this color coded classification system brings in two variables.

86
00:09:18,443 --> 00:09:25,327
[SPEAKER_01]: First, the average case count per 100,000 people over the past two weeks, and also the percent positivity rate.

87
00:09:26,345 --> 00:09:29,226
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've looked at this a lot as a team and thought about this.

88
00:09:29,246 --> 00:09:45,390
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've also, as we thought about this sort of new classification system, we've also continued to look back at CDC guidance, which there is a, as you can imagine, a pretty strong alignment between guidance from the CDC and what we're seeing from DPH.

89
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:54,072
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll see here on the screen, this is a dashboard that was created by or titled CDC indicators and thresholds of risk.

90
00:09:54,752 --> 00:10:00,835
[SPEAKER_01]: which analyzes just the community prevalence of COVID and then the risk that that poses for transmission in schools.

91
00:10:01,876 --> 00:10:05,498
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see here that this looks at two of the same variables that I just outlined.

92
00:10:05,518 --> 00:10:13,142
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look in the left column, number of new cases per 100,000 within the past 14 days, and also percent positivity, right?

93
00:10:13,462 --> 00:10:19,566
[SPEAKER_01]: So this system, right, or this dashboard is looking at two of the criteria that were also outlined here.

94
00:10:20,436 --> 00:10:48,233
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, internally, as we've kind of looked at this, we've played out several scenarios, and we're going to walk through one today, is if, say, using the CDC guidance, we were to have 19 positive cases in the last 14 days per 100,000 residents and be at 4.5% positivity rate, that would put us in this range of the green, of the lower risk of transmission in schools.

95
00:10:49,384 --> 00:10:52,132
[SPEAKER_01]: which is interesting when we compare that back to...

96
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,427
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of the DPH's guidance.

97
00:10:55,467 --> 00:11:03,771
[SPEAKER_01]: If we had 19 positive cases per 100,000 in a four and a half percent positivity rate, that would put us in this bottom right quadrant right here in the red category.

98
00:11:04,571 --> 00:11:10,555
[SPEAKER_01]: So we share that to say that we have looked at like the alignment between sort of CDC and DPH.

99
00:11:10,955 --> 00:11:20,600
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also found that in our sort of, as we played out scenarios, that the DPH guidance has generally been more conservative than sort of the guidance from the CDC.

100
00:11:22,155 --> 00:11:24,036
[SPEAKER_01]: So sort of where does that bring us for now?

101
00:11:24,436 --> 00:11:36,582
[SPEAKER_01]: So what our recommendation and our proposal for tonight is that we update our dashboard to include the new color-coded classification system, which would look like this.

102
00:11:38,023 --> 00:11:41,725
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna stop sharing my screen for a second and bring you into the actual dashboard.

103
00:11:42,025 --> 00:11:43,826
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was the dashboard that was approved

104
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:51,176
[SPEAKER_01]: back in the 14th of October, you'll see that it has the old sort of color coded classification system.

105
00:11:51,596 --> 00:11:58,561
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're proposing for tonight is that we update this to have, again, the same number one around building classroom readiness.

106
00:11:59,647 --> 00:12:15,391
[SPEAKER_01]: update this number two to have the updated DPH guidance, and then keep this number three, which if you remember, this number three outlined specific scenarios in school related to if there's a positive case here or if there's a case in a cohort, if there's two cases in a cohort.

107
00:12:15,831 --> 00:12:27,053
[SPEAKER_01]: Our recommendation is to keep what the school committee had approved in numbers one and three, and right now just update this number two to now say using the Mass.

108
00:12:27,073 --> 00:12:29,314
[SPEAKER_01]: Department of Public Health color-coded classification.

109
00:12:29,934 --> 00:12:30,214
[SPEAKER_01]: system.

110
00:12:31,796 --> 00:12:43,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Now as I should I want to go through just one other thing quickly which is last time in our last school committee member meeting there were some questions around Tufts and the numbers of how like Tufts impacts the Medford numbers.

111
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:55,252
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have been able to work with Tufts and we are able to pull out sort of Tufts data and compare that and think about what's the impact of including Tufts in our Medford data and also what's the impact of pulling those out.

112
00:12:56,092 --> 00:13:04,115
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see in a recent sort of two-week span from 10-28 to 11-11, with Tufts included, we're at a 0.96% positivity rate.

113
00:13:04,195 --> 00:13:05,736
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we pull Tufts out, we're at 1.1%.

114
00:13:12,618 --> 00:13:26,446
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, you know, you could all decide about when and how would you want to pull Tufts out in certain circumstances and data analysis, but did just want to make it clear tonight that we do have the ability to pull Tufts out sort of as we're able to break down data.

115
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:36,872
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know I quickly provided an overview of what our recommendations would be for tonight, but I want to turn it over to Dr. Edward Vincent, who's just going to provide that with a little bit more clarity, sort of on our final slide.

116
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:59,720
[SPEAKER_06]: So our recommendations this evening are to continue to utilize parts one, building classroom readiness, and part three, district and school specific metrics from the original Medford Public Schools COVID-19 reopening dashboard as critical metrics in evaluating our safety and ultimately driving decision-making.

117
00:14:01,057 --> 00:14:21,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Our second recommendation would be a recommendation to approve, would be our hope that as we update part two, the Medford community health metrics of the original Medford Public Schools COVID-19 reopening dashboard to include DPHs updated color-coded classification system.

118
00:14:22,707 --> 00:14:38,483
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, in closing again, we are not recommending to overhaul everything that was approved on 1014 all the collaborative work the meetings that took place in the science lab the science wing and zoom meetings.

119
00:14:38,863 --> 00:14:44,787
[SPEAKER_06]: to come up with our original NPS dashboard, reopening dashboard.

120
00:14:45,347 --> 00:14:56,755
[SPEAKER_06]: But we are asking that we look at part two and accept the updated color-coded classification system from the Department of Public Health.

121
00:14:57,755 --> 00:15:08,042
[SPEAKER_06]: And I look forward to hearing your questions and comments from the team and responding to those questions this evening.

122
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:21,686
[SPEAKER_06]: I also would like to say that members of the team, Dr. Cushing, Dave Murphy, Nurse Toni Ray, I think Marian O'Connor for the Board of Health, and Ms.

123
00:15:21,706 --> 00:15:29,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Suzanne Galussi and or Joan Bowen, we will be more than happy to respond to any questions this evening.

124
00:15:30,288 --> 00:15:30,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

125
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:36,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for the presentation.

126
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:37,530
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Russo?

127
00:15:56,084 --> 00:15:58,666
[SPEAKER_16]: There we go, thank you, I couldn't unmute.

128
00:15:59,186 --> 00:16:00,828
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for the presentation, I appreciate it.

129
00:16:01,888 --> 00:16:10,835
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to disagree slightly with something that was just said that the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education is being more conservative.

130
00:16:11,356 --> 00:16:24,426
[SPEAKER_16]: When I read the CDC guidelines in bold, they say that their indicators are dependent upon the implementation of school and community mitigation strategies.

131
00:16:25,031 --> 00:16:26,711
[SPEAKER_16]: DESE does not have that dependency.

132
00:16:28,392 --> 00:16:42,435
[SPEAKER_16]: All measures make no sense at all without, according to CDC, if you don't have a quality implementation of the school and community mitigation strategies, then the other measures are sort of unimportant.

133
00:16:43,556 --> 00:16:45,756
[SPEAKER_16]: DESE just seems to be okay with just numbers.

134
00:16:46,676 --> 00:16:52,578
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think that the CDC guidance is definitely far more conservative in that regard.

135
00:16:54,237 --> 00:16:58,658
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's sort of where I want to go in our conversation.

136
00:16:58,678 --> 00:17:07,900
[SPEAKER_16]: I won't just do all the talking, but I need to understand better our contact tracing.

137
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,181
[SPEAKER_16]: There's three pieces to this.

138
00:17:09,221 --> 00:17:12,882
[SPEAKER_16]: There's the testing, there's the contact tracing, and then, of course, the isolation.

139
00:17:13,922 --> 00:17:17,923
[SPEAKER_16]: And I feel like the testing is sort of a moot point.

140
00:17:18,883 --> 00:17:19,923
[SPEAKER_16]: None of us can control.

141
00:17:19,943 --> 00:17:22,984
[SPEAKER_16]: I know the mayor is working to get more testing and to get

142
00:17:23,462 --> 00:17:24,963
[SPEAKER_16]: students tested and that'll be good.

143
00:17:26,144 --> 00:17:32,569
[SPEAKER_16]: But all of that is simply a proxy for the assumption that we have a random surveillance testing of our community and that doesn't exist.

144
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:39,154
[SPEAKER_16]: But contact tracing to me seems like the big elephant in the room.

145
00:17:39,814 --> 00:17:49,822
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't have metrics that tell me how good ours is, how fast it is, if we have enough staff, how much contact tracing could our staff do before we run out of hours in the day.

146
00:17:49,842 --> 00:17:49,882
[SPEAKER_16]: So

147
00:17:52,258 --> 00:18:05,302
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, the CDC is clear, metrics are dependent, meaning literally everything above that must be based on a implementation of school and community mitigation strategies.

148
00:18:05,782 --> 00:18:09,644
[SPEAKER_16]: So I feel that that's the necessary part that we need to understand.

149
00:18:09,664 --> 00:18:12,925
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

150
00:18:12,945 --> 00:18:17,226
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Member Russo.

151
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:34,000
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I were to respond in terms of the contact tracing that's taking place right now, it is our nursing department.

152
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:39,842
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to just acknowledge nurse Tony Ray and acknowledge once again, Marianne O'Connor.

153
00:18:40,542 --> 00:18:45,704
[SPEAKER_06]: The work that we've been doing since school has opened is not a Monday to Friday schedule.

154
00:18:46,464 --> 00:18:51,666
[SPEAKER_06]: We're also working on weekends, closely monitoring the activity that's happening in Medford.

155
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,187
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I do want to thank

156
00:18:54,442 --> 00:19:03,709
[SPEAKER_06]: the entire nursing department and the board of health for how they have truly partnered with us in terms of helping us get information quickly.

157
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:11,915
[SPEAKER_06]: And so for the nine positive cases that have happened since September, thankfully we have been able to

158
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:18,220
[SPEAKER_06]: do contact tracing, reach out to those families and reach out to the individuals.

159
00:19:19,401 --> 00:19:25,746
[SPEAKER_06]: All of the contact tracing is done through the nursing department at the respective schools.

160
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:33,292
[SPEAKER_06]: And so whether it's students or staff that are helping to provide the information.

161
00:19:34,493 --> 00:19:36,074
[SPEAKER_06]: And so what I can speak to is

162
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:43,235
[SPEAKER_06]: The contact tracing that is happening and that has taken place, we've responded and acted appropriately.

163
00:19:43,835 --> 00:20:02,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, as I said earlier, we know that dealing with each case on an individualized basis, that there is a nuance and it does require some flexibility, but we have always, always maintained safety as a priority, not only for the students, but also for the staff.

164
00:20:03,048 --> 00:20:07,310
[SPEAKER_06]: And so out of an abundance of caution, we've always taken a more aggressive stance.

165
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:13,312
[SPEAKER_06]: And so through contact tracing, if that required additional quarantining, we have always done that.

166
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:30,638
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can't speak to how the contact tracing is done, but I can say that the nurses, the nursing department, they've been trained, all that are doing it, they're working in collaboration with the board of health,

167
00:20:31,156 --> 00:20:41,178
[SPEAKER_06]: and have received the same training that the Board of Health staff have received, which is an agreement with the Department of Health of how contact tracing should take place.

168
00:20:41,898 --> 00:20:52,320
[SPEAKER_06]: And at this point in time, it has been manageable for the district, given the level of positivity that we've had as a district.

169
00:20:52,861 --> 00:20:56,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I will qualify it by saying at this point in time.

170
00:20:58,762 --> 00:20:59,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

171
00:21:00,848 --> 00:21:01,468
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Rousseau.

172
00:21:03,108 --> 00:21:03,448
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

173
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:07,369
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to let the other members have questions, but so I just had a set of questions.

174
00:21:07,409 --> 00:21:10,710
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll just start to do a few and then let other people speak.

175
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:19,151
[SPEAKER_16]: How many contact tracers do we have for the school system and the city adjusted for FTEs?

176
00:21:19,171 --> 00:21:22,012
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I know the nurses are not full-time contact tracers.

177
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:29,773
[SPEAKER_06]: All contact tracing happening at the school

178
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:37,381
[SPEAKER_06]: happens with the entire nursing staff at their respective buildings.

179
00:21:38,642 --> 00:21:55,413
[SPEAKER_06]: So there were nurses at all of the schools and Tony Ray also oversees that and keeps a separate database to track all of the activity that is happening.

180
00:21:55,693 --> 00:21:58,775
[SPEAKER_06]: And it is eventually reported out to,

181
00:22:00,843 --> 00:22:01,764
[SPEAKER_06]: the department as well.

182
00:22:02,924 --> 00:22:03,244
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

183
00:22:03,304 --> 00:22:05,966
[SPEAKER_16]: What's the software we're using to track contacts?

184
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:13,871
[SPEAKER_11]: MAVEN is the name of the program that the state requires cities and towns to use.

185
00:22:14,711 --> 00:22:16,632
[SPEAKER_16]: So our nurses are all accessing MAVEN.

186
00:22:17,072 --> 00:22:22,496
[SPEAKER_16]: They're entering individual contacts, indicating whether they've followed up with them, the whole nine yards.

187
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:23,936
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

188
00:22:23,996 --> 00:22:26,578
[SPEAKER_11]: O'Connor, if you're on, you can, thanks.

189
00:22:28,499 --> 00:22:30,040
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have

190
00:22:31,198 --> 00:22:33,619
[SPEAKER_08]: three school nurses right now currently on Maven.

191
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:41,424
[SPEAKER_08]: The school contact tracing happens in collaboration with the Board of Health and the school nurses.

192
00:22:41,484 --> 00:22:45,106
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the contact tracing done within the school building itself.

193
00:22:46,346 --> 00:22:50,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Any information is then transferred into Maven.

194
00:22:50,128 --> 00:22:58,693
[SPEAKER_08]: So these cases, what happens with the schools a lot of the time is these cases of self-reporting before we even see them in Maven.

195
00:22:59,938 --> 00:23:09,324
[SPEAKER_08]: So then we're getting the call from the school nurse or from Tony saying this child has this mother call, this child has test positive or the mother has it or the father has it.

196
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:13,446
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they start their immediate contact tracing within the school building.

197
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:20,531
[SPEAKER_08]: The information they gather, if they're not currently on MAVEN is then given to my staff and resubmitted into MAVEN.

198
00:23:22,472 --> 00:23:22,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

199
00:23:22,852 --> 00:23:24,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, definitely.

200
00:23:25,474 --> 00:23:27,655
[SPEAKER_16]: So how does the nurse,

201
00:23:28,158 --> 00:23:31,779
[SPEAKER_16]: within a building do contact tracing for a student that is not in the school building?

202
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,721
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure what you're asking, Sagan.

203
00:23:37,341 --> 00:23:39,061
[SPEAKER_16]: So my kids are both full remote.

204
00:23:39,281 --> 00:23:43,223
[SPEAKER_16]: If one of them becomes positive, how does the nurse at their school do contact tracing?

205
00:23:45,043 --> 00:23:49,945
[SPEAKER_08]: So if they're remote, it typically would fall back onto the Board of Health.

206
00:23:50,985 --> 00:23:54,246
[SPEAKER_08]: The nurses are calling them.

207
00:23:55,019 --> 00:23:59,120
[SPEAKER_08]: The school nurses are calling those families, I believe, and following up with them.

208
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,901
[SPEAKER_08]: But if they're not within the school building, then the contact tracing doesn't have to happen in the school building.

209
00:24:04,141 --> 00:24:06,481
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more of a community contact tracing at that point.

210
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:10,242
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's when we call and we find out it's from the household.

211
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:13,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Mom had it, brought it home or whatever.

212
00:24:15,023 --> 00:24:15,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

213
00:24:15,503 --> 00:24:17,364
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll ask one more and then let other people talk.

214
00:24:18,764 --> 00:24:23,825
[SPEAKER_16]: So how many cases can you contact trace before you're out of capacity?

215
00:24:25,662 --> 00:24:27,943
[SPEAKER_08]: We keep going until we can't.

216
00:24:27,963 --> 00:24:30,544
[SPEAKER_08]: So you have to understand the cases come in 24 seven.

217
00:24:31,404 --> 00:24:33,165
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't come in just nine to five.

218
00:24:33,285 --> 00:24:42,549
[SPEAKER_08]: So we will get them whenever, as soon as we wake up in the morning, you get the ones that came in from midnight on and you start working on that.

219
00:24:42,589 --> 00:24:45,710
[SPEAKER_08]: We are onboarding because of the search that we're currently in.

220
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:54,033
[SPEAKER_08]: We are actually onboarding five more contact tracers this week, hopefully, to keep up with the demand because it is, yeah,

221
00:24:54,403 --> 00:25:17,705
[SPEAKER_08]: happens a lot of the time it's not easy as far as you know you make a phone call they pick it up and you're all it's sometimes it takes several calls to actually get through to someone and you know may take a day for them to call you back so it's it's various you can't really say you know this is every case takes so many minutes or hours or whatever it's all different.

222
00:25:19,867 --> 00:25:20,047
Thank you.

223
00:25:21,723 --> 00:25:31,485
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's important to point out, there must be a timeframe, Miriam, that you can probably speak to on when the first call goes out from the Board of Health to a positive case.

224
00:25:31,665 --> 00:25:37,446
[SPEAKER_11]: And if there was ever a chance we needed more help with that, the state is providing contact traces.

225
00:25:37,506 --> 00:25:38,706
[SPEAKER_11]: So we do have that backup.

226
00:25:38,786 --> 00:25:41,827
[SPEAKER_11]: Although I don't think we've needed to use the state.

227
00:25:42,567 --> 00:25:48,388
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a little bit now lately with the searches, just particularly for the contacts, as opposed to the, you know,

228
00:25:49,598 --> 00:25:51,519
[SPEAKER_08]: The positive case itself.

229
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:52,759
[SPEAKER_08]: We were following up on them.

230
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:56,941
[SPEAKER_08]: What we found recently like again it's mostly household transmission.

231
00:25:57,441 --> 00:26:00,883
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's easy when you make that first call to the to the actual case.

232
00:26:01,723 --> 00:26:07,186
[SPEAKER_08]: They say I live with three other people, and you do the contact tracing right there and then on the phone because it's the household transmission.

233
00:26:09,406 --> 00:26:16,593
[SPEAKER_08]: But so the state does have what's called the CTC and now they're picking up twice a day.

234
00:26:17,094 --> 00:26:19,856
[SPEAKER_08]: So I believe it's like two and I wanna say 6 p.m.

235
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:25,162
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we have gotten new cases in and haven't gotten to those cases by two or 6 p.m.

236
00:26:25,202 --> 00:26:30,427
[SPEAKER_08]: that day, the CTC automatically grabs them and does the follow-up on them.

237
00:26:39,365 --> 00:26:41,225
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't put the other one with questions, but I have more.

238
00:26:41,245 --> 00:26:44,786
[SPEAKER_16]: I can just keep going.

239
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:45,846
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep, keep going.

240
00:26:45,866 --> 00:26:49,227
[SPEAKER_11]: And any member that has a question during can always raise their hand.

241
00:26:49,287 --> 00:26:50,287
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got my eyes open.

242
00:26:50,927 --> 00:26:51,287
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

243
00:26:52,107 --> 00:26:53,148
[SPEAKER_16]: So Ms.

244
00:26:53,188 --> 00:27:05,550
[SPEAKER_16]: O'Connor, on the CDC website, there's a whole page called Evaluating Case Investigation and Contact Tracing Success that recommends a long list of canned reports to evaluate how

245
00:27:07,305 --> 00:27:14,769
[SPEAKER_16]: the number and percentage of contacts that are being interviewed within 24 hours, the number of cases that are closed in a period.

246
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:18,371
[SPEAKER_16]: I won't go through the list because it's a substantial list.

247
00:27:19,412 --> 00:27:24,514
[SPEAKER_16]: Are we doing, are we actually creating those reports?

248
00:27:24,995 --> 00:27:35,220
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't know if those would come out of MAVEN or if MAVEN is even designed to handle this stuff, but the, you know, I read through every one of the, I don't know, 30, 40,

249
00:27:37,933 --> 00:27:42,295
[SPEAKER_16]: recommended reports for evaluating our success.

250
00:27:43,176 --> 00:27:47,098
[SPEAKER_16]: And I couldn't find any that didn't seem really important.

251
00:27:47,338 --> 00:27:49,119
[SPEAKER_16]: I suppose that's why they're on the CDC website.

252
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,702
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a yes or no question as far as MAVEN goes.

253
00:27:55,322 --> 00:27:58,704
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can run reports out of MAVEN.

254
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:01,405
[SPEAKER_08]: I can run open cases.

255
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:03,246
[SPEAKER_08]: I can run closed cases.

256
00:28:03,887 --> 00:28:06,668
[SPEAKER_08]: I can see when they were put into MAVEN.

257
00:28:07,304 --> 00:28:11,528
[SPEAKER_08]: as opposed to when we were able to pick them up, contact them directly.

258
00:28:11,728 --> 00:28:16,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, do I know that's because the nurse didn't get through for a day?

259
00:28:16,914 --> 00:28:19,116
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I could never tell you that out of Maven.

260
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:24,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Or do I know that's because they just didn't get to it?

261
00:28:25,402 --> 00:28:26,563
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't tell you that out of Maven.

262
00:28:26,863 --> 00:28:30,567
[SPEAKER_08]: Maven's very limited in what you can get in and get out.

263
00:28:32,788 --> 00:28:42,633
[SPEAKER_08]: So, so the answer is, you know, yes, we're keeping an eye on those things and yes, we'll follow up and I can look into Maven and I can see what's outstanding and what's not.

264
00:28:43,133 --> 00:28:52,618
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it's just a matter of, I need to, I follow up sometimes directly with my public health nurse or whatever and say, how come this person hasn't been contacted or what's going on with this person?

265
00:28:53,139 --> 00:28:57,901
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's when I'll hear, well, I left five messages, you know, and they haven't called me back or whatever.

266
00:28:57,981 --> 00:29:01,363
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't, does that answer your question?

267
00:29:02,718 --> 00:29:04,339
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I mean, you know, I don't know.

268
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:08,123
[SPEAKER_16]: MAVEN probably wasn't designed to answer this very large set of questions.

269
00:29:08,223 --> 00:29:09,744
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm not surprised.

270
00:29:10,244 --> 00:29:14,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, MAVEN was originally designed and we've been using MAVEN forever for all infectious disease.

271
00:29:14,888 --> 00:29:18,671
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the state infectious disease reporting software.

272
00:29:18,731 --> 00:29:27,459
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was not designed specifically for COVID and they're trying to add additional fields and add additional, you know, information.

273
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,202
[SPEAKER_08]: But even like when they ask about

274
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,921
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, is it indoor dining?

275
00:29:34,021 --> 00:29:35,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it going to the gym?

276
00:29:35,582 --> 00:29:35,963
[SPEAKER_08]: What is it?

277
00:29:36,003 --> 00:29:36,763
[SPEAKER_08]: What's happening with it?

278
00:29:37,264 --> 00:29:39,685
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no specific data field in MAVEN.

279
00:29:40,186 --> 00:29:44,189
[SPEAKER_08]: You'd have to go through every individual nurse's notes to read.

280
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,391
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not easily accessible.

281
00:29:47,431 --> 00:29:47,972
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't pull it out.

282
00:29:48,032 --> 00:29:55,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Now the state is adding that data field, I believe, the employment and other features like that.

283
00:29:55,317 --> 00:29:57,178
[SPEAKER_08]: So it might make it a little easier going forward.

284
00:29:58,599 --> 00:29:58,960
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

285
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,161
[SPEAKER_16]: So I had a question for the superintendent.

286
00:30:02,895 --> 00:30:07,962
[SPEAKER_16]: How do you know that contact tracing is happening 100% of the time for the students?

287
00:30:12,668 --> 00:30:14,811
[SPEAKER_06]: I could only speak to the nine students.

288
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:37,085
[SPEAKER_06]: that we have the data for right now that once we're notified, whether it's by the parent notifying the school or we're given the information from the board of health calling the school department to say we have a student and their test results came in positive.

289
00:30:37,605 --> 00:30:41,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Once we are given that information, the next steps are that

290
00:30:42,547 --> 00:30:47,892
[SPEAKER_06]: the school-based nurses would begin the process of contact tracing.

291
00:30:49,653 --> 00:30:52,976
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the information that I have for you for right now.

292
00:30:53,076 --> 00:30:55,818
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's what we have.

293
00:30:55,878 --> 00:31:03,024
[SPEAKER_06]: And once we have the information, it's given to the Board of Health, if it's done on the school side, and then it's entered into

294
00:31:04,338 --> 00:31:05,218
[SPEAKER_06]: the MAVEN system.

295
00:31:05,678 --> 00:31:21,522
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think depending on the individual, whether it's an adult, depending on the individual or depending on the information that you're given as possible close contacts, they follow the appropriate steps.

296
00:31:25,623 --> 00:31:26,023
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

297
00:31:26,824 --> 00:31:30,884
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the slides we have, which I don't, there's that one.

298
00:31:31,565 --> 00:31:33,025
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the slides in the slide deck

299
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:36,430
[SPEAKER_16]: Excuse me.

300
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:38,831
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I'm sorry, not that one.

301
00:31:39,291 --> 00:31:40,912
[SPEAKER_16]: Too many slides, not that many really.

302
00:31:42,012 --> 00:31:53,275
[SPEAKER_16]: The COVID-19 positive case count that you showed, I guess one of the things that was confusing to me was that all hybrid kids are also remote kids.

303
00:31:54,916 --> 00:32:02,038
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I felt like this should actually be adjusted for days of in-school

304
00:32:02,792 --> 00:32:04,612
[SPEAKER_16]: versus days not in school.

305
00:32:04,872 --> 00:32:13,454
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, we have hybrid kids when we send whole classrooms or cohorts home because of an infection, they don't suddenly show up on the remote group.

306
00:32:13,914 --> 00:32:15,014
[SPEAKER_16]: They're still hybrid kids.

307
00:32:15,574 --> 00:32:22,775
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just find these, you know, nine total for hybrid, nine out of how many kids?

308
00:32:23,796 --> 00:32:26,456
[SPEAKER_16]: And out of how many days in school?

309
00:32:26,956 --> 00:32:29,577
[SPEAKER_16]: Because every hybrid kid is also a remote kid.

310
00:32:30,057 --> 00:32:32,057
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I mean, these numbers are,

311
00:32:32,862 --> 00:32:36,843
[SPEAKER_16]: certainly important, but they don't provide any context or scale.

312
00:32:36,863 --> 00:32:47,445
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, if we had 18 remote kids in all, and all the rest of the kids were hybrid, then, I mean, DCF would probably be involved if literally every remote kid was positive.

313
00:32:48,625 --> 00:33:00,068
[SPEAKER_16]: But we don't, these numbers imply that twice as many kids who are remote are becoming infected, but that doesn't tell you that twice,

314
00:33:01,452 --> 00:33:04,854
[SPEAKER_16]: what percentage of the kids are actually remote versus hybrid.

315
00:33:06,115 --> 00:33:13,180
[SPEAKER_16]: And the hybrid kids, we have the hybrid kids that are not in yet, they're in cohort that is considered hybrid.

316
00:33:14,281 --> 00:33:19,305
[SPEAKER_06]: So right now we have approximately 1,700 kids in school.

317
00:33:19,985 --> 00:33:25,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Of those 1,700 students, whether they're cohort A, B or C, of those 1,700,

318
00:33:26,877 --> 00:33:38,103
[SPEAKER_06]: that are coming in for in-person instruction two days a week or four days a week, nine of those students have tested positive since the start of school.

319
00:33:38,643 --> 00:33:50,150
[SPEAKER_06]: So since September 16th, nine students tested positive of the 1,700 that, approximately 1,700 that are in school right now.

320
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:53,011
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have another 900 or so that are online once we

321
00:33:57,078 --> 00:33:59,679
[SPEAKER_06]: have our remaining high school students join the fold.

322
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:23,923
[SPEAKER_06]: So of the 1,700 students that have come into Medford Public Schools, whether it's four days a week and you were part of cohort A, two days a week if you were part of cohort B, or two days a week and you were part of cohort C, from those three cohorts since September, we have had nine students test positive in Medford.

323
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:39,904
[SPEAKER_06]: During that same time frame from September until now, students that are in cohort D, the fully remote cohort, we have had 18 students test positive.

324
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,997
[SPEAKER_06]: for COVID-19.

325
00:34:43,497 --> 00:34:59,151
[SPEAKER_06]: So of the approximately 1300 students that have officially or students that have officially selected remote, a fully remote program, they make up those 18 students

326
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:16,012
[SPEAKER_06]: are from Cohort D. So, where you were saying the nine students, is it a Cohort A student or a Cohort B if they were in school Monday, Tuesday or in school Thursday, Friday, they're all classified

327
00:35:17,353 --> 00:35:34,579
[SPEAKER_06]: for the purposes of just that table, so that people can't figure it out, I guess, but for the purposes of that table, if they come into Medford Public Schools for in-person instruction, at this point in time, nine students tested positive.

328
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:38,481
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope that provides a- It does, thank you.

329
00:35:38,961 --> 00:35:43,503
[SPEAKER_16]: But I guess my question was, the eighth graders were the last group in, well,

330
00:35:45,089 --> 00:35:50,692
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's just take the eighth grades, for instance, who just one of the last middle school, one of the last groups to come in.

331
00:35:51,212 --> 00:35:56,675
[SPEAKER_16]: They have been in cohort B or C since school started.

332
00:35:57,596 --> 00:36:05,160
[SPEAKER_16]: So if I'm an eighth grader and I tested positive in the middle of September, I am a hybrid kid who tested positive.

333
00:36:07,341 --> 00:36:11,544
[SPEAKER_16]: I was nowhere near a building because I wasn't starting for weeks and weeks.

334
00:36:11,984 --> 00:36:13,745
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just wanna know that the nine

335
00:36:14,783 --> 00:36:28,697
[SPEAKER_16]: truly only means kids that have actually gone to the school building, or are we just simply dividing by cohorts, in which case this doesn't actually, this doesn't help us understand, does going to school have any impact?

336
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:45,616
[SPEAKER_06]: The nine students that are listed, those are the nine students that were physically crossed the threshold and entered one of the Medford public school buildings for in-person instruction.

337
00:36:46,176 --> 00:36:54,359
[SPEAKER_06]: And while they were receiving in-person instruction or it may have been a cohort B child that

338
00:36:56,082 --> 00:37:11,447
[SPEAKER_06]: tested positive on a cohort C day, but they're still classified as a student that's attending and participating in instruction as cohort A, B, or C, then that's the student that was counted.

339
00:37:12,408 --> 00:37:13,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information.

340
00:37:14,508 --> 00:37:16,169
[SPEAKER_09]: So just for, may I, ma'am?

341
00:37:16,947 --> 00:37:20,370
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information, member McLaughlin, and then member Van de Kloet has her hand up as well.

342
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:21,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm sorry, member Van de Kloet.

343
00:37:21,851 --> 00:37:22,792
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you have a point of information.

344
00:37:23,372 --> 00:37:34,521
[SPEAKER_09]: So just if I understand you correctly, the nine students are students who physically crossed the threshold and went into the building, right?

345
00:37:35,302 --> 00:37:35,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

346
00:37:35,822 --> 00:37:36,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

347
00:37:36,243 --> 00:37:41,747
[SPEAKER_09]: And the 18 are students who have not yet physically crossed the threshold and gone into the building.

348
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:42,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that accurate?

349
00:37:43,433 --> 00:37:58,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's my understanding, that the 18 students that are listed as remote are our remote-only students, and the nine were students that were physically on campus at one point in time.

350
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:17,748
[SPEAKER_09]: Or to member Rousseau's point, point of information, or to member Rousseau's point, the 18 could be an aggregate of students who are in, say, cohort B or C, but had not yet gone into the hybrid physical threshold model yet because they were at the time remote, right?

351
00:38:19,215 --> 00:38:30,809
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a, I mean, I don't have the actual list of- Right, so the point of information is basically whenever the students were tested positive, they are in these two buckets.

352
00:38:30,829 --> 00:38:36,535
[SPEAKER_09]: They had either nine been in the building or 18 had not been in the building at the point of testing.

353
00:38:36,896 --> 00:38:37,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

354
00:38:37,877 --> 00:38:38,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, thank you.

355
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:44,551
[SPEAKER_11]: Member van de Kloot?

356
00:38:45,132 --> 00:38:51,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, so I just wanted to go back to Mary Ann if I could, or Tony, I don't know who better to ask this question.

357
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,883
[SPEAKER_07]: So all together there we have 27 students.

358
00:38:55,523 --> 00:38:57,966
[SPEAKER_07]: When the contact tracers call their home,

359
00:38:58,967 --> 00:39:08,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it generally, like of the 27, do they know where they were in contact with someone with COVID?

360
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:15,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Do they have certainty of the, like you mentioned, well, the father had it or the mother, or do you have people saying, I have no idea?

361
00:39:18,152 --> 00:39:19,233
[SPEAKER_08]: Both, yes.

362
00:39:19,513 --> 00:39:23,114
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have people who say, I work from home remote, like if the father gets it.

363
00:39:23,554 --> 00:39:24,814
[SPEAKER_08]: I work from home remotely.

364
00:39:25,334 --> 00:39:26,395
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't done anything.

365
00:39:27,495 --> 00:39:35,160
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, one of them, one of the remote children that sticks out in my head, that both parents worked home remote, the child's home remote.

366
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,702
[SPEAKER_08]: They said, the only thing that we do, we know that we do is we go to the playground.

367
00:39:40,763 --> 00:39:47,327
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, other than that, so it's some people can say, yes, I was exposed to a coworker.

368
00:39:47,847 --> 00:39:52,610
[SPEAKER_08]: So some people it's easier, but a lot of people give us that answer of, I don't

369
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:55,140
[SPEAKER_08]: have any idea how I could have gotten this.

370
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you follow up and ask them if they've been going to the grocery store and other specifics?

371
00:40:00,201 --> 00:40:00,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

372
00:40:00,901 --> 00:40:06,823
[SPEAKER_08]: And obviously, most of them do go out and about and do what they need to do as far as errands go.

373
00:40:06,843 --> 00:40:10,944
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's no way that they would say, I know I got it at the grocery store.

374
00:40:11,164 --> 00:40:21,447
[SPEAKER_07]: So of the students, of the 27 students, if we could talk about in-school transmission, how many of those are suspected to be in-school transmission?

375
00:40:22,359 --> 00:40:25,541
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now we've only had one of those students.

376
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:27,903
[SPEAKER_08]: One of those students isn't in school transmission.

377
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:38,310
[SPEAKER_08]: The other eight, we are clear that it was not in school transmission because it was from a household member who had previously already had it.

378
00:40:39,338 --> 00:40:54,607
[SPEAKER_07]: So in the in-school transmission case, and I realize we don't obviously wanna identify anybody, but how was it determined that that student, did they come to school sick?

379
00:40:56,088 --> 00:40:58,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you just give us a better understanding?

380
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:08,035
[SPEAKER_08]: So the only way we determine in-school transmission is because of the first case we had identified the close contacts

381
00:41:08,438 --> 00:41:14,721
[SPEAKER_08]: we had put those close contacts into quarantine and then it was one of those close contacts who then became positive.

382
00:41:15,882 --> 00:41:21,444
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why we are saying that we assume it was from his close contact that he became positive and it was in school.

383
00:41:22,005 --> 00:41:22,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you, Maria.

384
00:41:23,005 --> 00:41:31,389
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, member Graham.

385
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:34,911
[SPEAKER_11]: And then member McLaughlin.

386
00:41:37,405 --> 00:41:37,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

387
00:41:38,686 --> 00:41:59,520
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking at the chart and I just want to make, I think this chart deserves some definitions around remote and hybrid because I think as people look at this, you know, to look at September, it sounds great until you realize that a very small number of children went to school for three days in September.

388
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:06,045
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's good that there was no transmission, but like the even chance of that was very, very low because our

389
00:42:06,946 --> 00:42:09,907
[SPEAKER_05]: our cohort A didn't come back until September 28th, right?

390
00:42:11,007 --> 00:42:23,370
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think what is complex about what we are doing here is we have students who have chosen hybrid who are still at home, and then we have remote students.

391
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:29,351
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when we say it's remote students, I want people to just be clear about who is in that category.

392
00:42:30,732 --> 00:42:35,553
[SPEAKER_05]: So for example, like the question that I had based on some of the conversation we've been having is in October,

393
00:42:36,363 --> 00:42:41,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Medford High School, which in October only Cohort A was in the building.

394
00:42:41,728 --> 00:42:48,434
[SPEAKER_05]: There were three students who tested positive who are hybrid and six who tested positive who are remote.

395
00:42:49,114 --> 00:42:55,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that mean that those three students were from Cohort A and the six

396
00:42:56,009 --> 00:43:08,360
[SPEAKER_05]: were everybody else, or does it mean that the three include students who chose hybrid, but are still home because the high school has not welcomed students back.

397
00:43:09,241 --> 00:43:13,305
[SPEAKER_05]: And the six is among those students who have chosen to stay remote.

398
00:43:14,486 --> 00:43:21,252
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that October line for the high school feels like the place where we can clearly sort of define this.

399
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:30,463
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's uncomplicated in that we were not rolling students in in the month of October.

400
00:43:31,684 --> 00:43:39,988
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't think that it's crystal clear, certainly not on this chart, what these categories mean.

401
00:43:40,228 --> 00:43:44,910
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it can and should be clear as we publish this data.

402
00:43:49,532 --> 00:43:51,893
[SPEAKER_06]: So what you're asking,

403
00:43:52,623 --> 00:44:15,735
[SPEAKER_06]: is that the October data that reflected the remote students to go and confirm that those six students truly were on the fully remote list or were they students that were waiting for their particular grade level to come into school as part of the staggered hybrid.

404
00:44:16,175 --> 00:44:19,537
[SPEAKER_06]: So to possibly have a third column of remote

405
00:44:21,062 --> 00:44:27,386
[SPEAKER_06]: waiting for, waiting to matriculate to in-person instruction is what it sounds like you're saying that.

406
00:44:28,486 --> 00:44:35,130
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm asking, yeah, I'm asking which way we are interpreting these headers.

407
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:48,077
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the reason it's relevant is because if you're going to start moving students across the line, so to speak, the data gets really hard to digest and interpret, right?

408
00:44:48,197 --> 00:44:49,558
[SPEAKER_05]: So if somebody,

409
00:44:51,082 --> 00:44:56,584
[SPEAKER_05]: is on the right side of the line today, but when we welcome them back now they're on the left side of the line.

410
00:44:56,604 --> 00:45:14,371
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know that that is as helpful as if we had clarity about, you know, the students who are in and maybe it is as simple as having three columns like you're suggesting, but I just, I want the definitions, whether it's two columns or three columns to be really clear.

411
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:15,920
[SPEAKER_05]: and unchanging.

412
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:33,091
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we talk about our population, we can be clear about what the population is and means as we look at the number of four to conclude is four good or four not good based on that population.

413
00:45:33,111 --> 00:45:36,953
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information?

414
00:45:39,274 --> 00:45:42,016
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Grims, finish, you're up next anyway.

415
00:45:42,056 --> 00:45:43,137
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin.

416
00:45:44,577 --> 00:45:45,078
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, thank you.

417
00:45:46,219 --> 00:46:03,116
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think what I'm hearing is that I think that it's an interesting point in terms of to the sort of denominator, if you will, of the number and the data so that, for example, if there are, you know, three students that were tested positive in

418
00:46:05,838 --> 00:46:18,884
[SPEAKER_09]: and we know that the denominator there was 100 students total, so three out of 100 students total, because those were the students that had been across the threshold in that point, for example.

419
00:46:19,464 --> 00:46:29,088
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that if I'm understanding correctly, the denominator is helpful as well, so that three out of 100 is very different from eight out of 1,700, right?

420
00:46:31,209 --> 00:46:33,731
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that sort of denominator can be helpful.

421
00:46:33,771 --> 00:46:38,675
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe it's either, again, the denominator or some percentages that help clarify that information.

422
00:46:39,315 --> 00:46:47,321
[SPEAKER_09]: But then I would also ask if I might, Marianne O'Connor, I don't see you, where are you?

423
00:46:47,341 --> 00:46:48,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, there you are.

424
00:46:48,241 --> 00:46:48,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Marianne.

425
00:46:51,344 --> 00:46:57,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you, just, you know, at the risk of being a little bit pedantic, would you mind just sort of sharing your,

426
00:47:00,243 --> 00:47:09,491
[SPEAKER_09]: background, how long you've been doing this, sort of, you know, you know, what your role is, you know, just a little bit for especially for people who don't know, I would ask that.

427
00:47:09,551 --> 00:47:13,574
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I would ask whether you think that this is a reasonable plan moving forward.

428
00:47:14,335 --> 00:47:14,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

429
00:47:16,637 --> 00:47:22,622
[SPEAKER_08]: So, as of August, I've been with Medford as the director of the Board of Health for four years.

430
00:47:23,682 --> 00:47:29,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Prior to that, I was in Lynn, I was the director of the Board of Health in Lynn for

431
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:30,410
[SPEAKER_08]: 12 years.

432
00:47:31,451 --> 00:47:40,454
[SPEAKER_08]: And prior to that, I was a vice president of a hospital system in healthcare.

433
00:47:40,714 --> 00:47:44,295
[SPEAKER_08]: So for many years, I'm showing my age.

434
00:47:47,196 --> 00:47:47,917
[SPEAKER_08]: What was the other question?

435
00:47:47,957 --> 00:47:48,277
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

436
00:47:51,464 --> 00:48:03,067
[SPEAKER_09]: The other question, is it your professional opinion that this plan that is being proposed by the central administration is a plan that should go forward?

437
00:48:06,007 --> 00:48:12,829
[SPEAKER_08]: I do, because I think we're not looking at any one particular metric to move us.

438
00:48:13,549 --> 00:48:15,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Like they had said, it's a combination.

439
00:48:15,649 --> 00:48:17,790
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of variation you have to look at.

440
00:48:18,349 --> 00:48:21,511
[SPEAKER_08]: what's happening in the schools, but you have to look at what's happening in the community.

441
00:48:23,212 --> 00:48:35,238
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think, you know, if we had an outbreak, God forbid, at one of our long-term care facilities again, our TAS or something, you know, we would have to look at that as a cluster that's separate and doesn't impact our schools, right?

442
00:48:35,478 --> 00:48:38,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though it may impact our numbers and our positivity rates.

443
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:44,383
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think knowing that we're being nimble in what we do,

444
00:48:45,126 --> 00:48:50,167
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, we're looking at the whole picture and we're not saying this is the one thing.

445
00:48:50,347 --> 00:48:51,728
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no silver bullet, right?

446
00:48:52,428 --> 00:48:54,868
[SPEAKER_08]: If there was, we would have done that a long time ago.

447
00:48:56,149 --> 00:49:03,210
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think looking at the total picture, I think the plan that they're presenting is sound, very sound.

448
00:49:05,811 --> 00:49:06,231
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

449
00:49:07,952 --> 00:49:09,452
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Kretz, then Member Graham.

450
00:49:13,092 --> 00:49:13,592
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

451
00:49:14,093 --> 00:49:14,433
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

452
00:49:14,473 --> 00:49:15,434
[SPEAKER_17]: I just got my mic on.

453
00:49:15,874 --> 00:49:16,614
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

454
00:49:16,715 --> 00:49:16,855
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep.

455
00:49:17,835 --> 00:49:28,042
[SPEAKER_17]: So, thank you very much for the presentation, Dr. Edward Bitson and your entire staff, and a special thanks to Tony Ray and Marian O'Connor for everything that they do.

456
00:49:29,243 --> 00:49:31,465
[SPEAKER_17]: So I've been, you know, following the news and

457
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:45,642
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, listening to a lot of the emails and all the correspondence, you know, the public health experts, the desi commissioner, and the governor have expressed in light of the current COVID cases, students should be in school in person.

458
00:49:45,662 --> 00:49:50,667
[SPEAKER_17]: And I trust the medical professionals, health experts, the Board of Health,

459
00:49:51,308 --> 00:49:53,389
[SPEAKER_17]: and the State Board of Health and the CDC.

460
00:49:53,509 --> 00:49:56,710
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, I just, I really trust the experts.

461
00:49:57,790 --> 00:50:09,234
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I know there's the COVID numbers are on the rise, but from everything that's been presented, the spread has been, you know, there has been very little spread in transmission in the schools.

462
00:50:09,854 --> 00:50:19,077
[SPEAKER_17]: And the spread has been related to either, you know, community and or family or indoor outings, you know, and we have said many times that the schools are very safe.

463
00:50:19,937 --> 00:50:48,477
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, you know what I what I'd like to do is I'd like to make a motion to accept the superintendent's recommendations continue with The to utilize parts one building classroom readiness and three district and school specific metrics from the original member public schools Reopening dashboard and then update part two member community health metrics Of the original member public schools covid reopening dashboard to include the department of public health's updated color-coded

464
00:50:49,117 --> 00:50:50,358
[SPEAKER_17]: classification system.

465
00:50:50,858 --> 00:51:07,889
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just want to, you know, I want to definitely make that motion because I think that, you know, from hearing from all the experts and, you know, I just have to put my trust in the experts, the Department of Health, the Board of Health, the State Department of Health, the CDC, the governor, all their guidance.

466
00:51:08,529 --> 00:51:10,811
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, I think we should continue to monitor

467
00:51:11,861 --> 00:51:17,344
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, the numbers and pay very close attention, like what we're doing.

468
00:51:18,024 --> 00:51:20,286
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm just making that motion now.

469
00:51:22,227 --> 00:51:22,687
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll second.

470
00:51:24,768 --> 00:51:31,231
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I- Member McLaughlin seconded by Member Van de Kloot to call the roll.

471
00:51:31,932 --> 00:51:32,552
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a question.

472
00:51:32,592 --> 00:51:33,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Friendly amendment.

473
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,053
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not ready to do that.

474
00:51:35,054 --> 00:51:35,454
[SPEAKER_11]: Me either.

475
00:51:36,154 --> 00:51:37,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I make a friendly amendment?

476
00:51:38,856 --> 00:51:38,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

477
00:51:38,996 --> 00:51:40,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin and then Member Graham.

478
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:42,042
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

479
00:51:42,423 --> 00:52:00,158
[SPEAKER_09]: The amendment that I was going to suggest is that the data include the information we were just talking about a little while ago with some clarification around the denominator number, if you will, and the sort of the cohort, that third column that we were talking about, just so that it's really clear.

480
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:02,280
[SPEAKER_09]: And then obviously in the other

481
00:52:03,613 --> 00:52:05,253
[SPEAKER_09]: that's not included in this particular document.

482
00:52:05,273 --> 00:52:11,575
[SPEAKER_09]: We had underneath each of the criteria we had, you know, remote or hybrid based on a different color criteria.

483
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:13,155
[SPEAKER_09]: I did see that that wasn't included in this.

484
00:52:13,735 --> 00:52:14,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Particular dashboard.

485
00:52:14,856 --> 00:52:18,777
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you could just add that to so that it's really explicit for the community.

486
00:52:18,817 --> 00:52:19,717
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that would be great.

487
00:52:19,797 --> 00:52:25,058
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would just, you know, make a friendly amendment that that, um, data is included in the dashboard.

488
00:52:25,558 --> 00:52:26,038
[SPEAKER_09]: If member of

489
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,641
[SPEAKER_11]: We can't hear you, Mr. Murphy.

490
00:52:52,324 --> 00:52:58,625
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes this happens to me, but if you click on the little arrow near the mute, you can just reset your mic.

491
00:53:11,614 --> 00:53:12,494
[SPEAKER_13]: Just give me one second.

492
00:53:12,534 --> 00:53:14,556
[SPEAKER_13]: He's entered the room, and I'm going to make him a co-host.

493
00:53:16,337 --> 00:53:17,718
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, thank you, Dr. Cushing.

494
00:53:27,125 --> 00:53:28,246
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, sorry, how about now?

495
00:53:28,946 --> 00:53:29,947
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we can hear you.

496
00:53:30,387 --> 00:53:33,810
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope my comment is worth the wait there, but the thing

497
00:53:41,272 --> 00:53:54,654
[SPEAKER_14]: The thing that I wanted to say, and hopefully I'll be able to now without making everyone go deaf, is that with regard to this data, it can be disaggregated potentially with regard to the cohorts the way that Ms.

498
00:53:54,754 --> 00:53:55,555
[SPEAKER_14]: McLaughlin and Ms.

499
00:53:55,595 --> 00:53:56,975
[SPEAKER_14]: Graham have asked for.

500
00:53:56,995 --> 00:54:02,696
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to offer one point that you may want to take into consideration.

501
00:54:03,316 --> 00:54:06,317
[SPEAKER_14]: So when we look back, that is

502
00:54:06,813 --> 00:54:27,897
[SPEAKER_14]: information that it's somewhat easy to disaggregate because as members were saying, if students have not yet come in, they're not cohort B or cohort C in the sense that we would think about them as cohort B and cohort C as in being in the school buildings and being exposed and potentially exposing members of the school community.

503
00:54:29,217 --> 00:54:33,018
[SPEAKER_14]: As we go forward, that issue should

504
00:54:35,708 --> 00:54:42,690
[SPEAKER_14]: be of diminishing significance in the sense that we're only down to grades nine through 12.

505
00:54:43,991 --> 00:55:00,917
[SPEAKER_14]: And when we, presumably over the course of the next several weeks, and potentially a little bit longer, but hopefully several weeks, nine through 12 are in, and therefore there are no more students who are still pending their return to in-person instruction.

506
00:55:01,948 --> 00:55:13,497
[SPEAKER_14]: However, there may be situations where either programs are transitioned into remote or theoretically, under very extreme circumstances, a school goes into remote.

507
00:55:13,957 --> 00:55:20,643
[SPEAKER_14]: At that point, this data, it would be that much more complicated to disaggregate that.

508
00:55:21,003 --> 00:55:25,166
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't mean we can't do that and we'll disaggregate any data that the committee wants to see.

509
00:55:25,606 --> 00:55:27,448
[SPEAKER_14]: But for community members' benefit,

510
00:55:27,855 --> 00:55:37,923
[SPEAKER_14]: when looking at this, they may not be able to draw the conclusions that you typically would expect to draw based on that variable changing.

511
00:55:38,064 --> 00:55:49,573
[SPEAKER_14]: And the fact that you could have someone who's B and C, but for some period of time is fully remote, they contract the virus, and then all of a sudden they're being counted in an account that is misleading.

512
00:55:49,933 --> 00:55:55,698
[SPEAKER_14]: And so again, we'll disaggregate any data that we can that you'd like us to, but you should know that

513
00:55:57,172 --> 00:56:01,175
[SPEAKER_14]: The unintended consequence might be additional confusion rather than clarity.

514
00:56:01,855 --> 00:56:08,219
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, I apologize for if that wasn't worth the weight as I scrambled around my various computers here.

515
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:10,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

516
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:11,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Helpful.

517
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:13,523
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Graham.

518
00:56:15,804 --> 00:56:18,646
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually have several questions about the dashboard.

519
00:56:18,686 --> 00:56:25,090
[SPEAKER_05]: So to Member McLaughlin's point, what

520
00:56:25,583 --> 00:56:30,155
[SPEAKER_05]: is the recommendation about how the colors relate to school closing.

521
00:56:40,948 --> 00:56:42,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Superintendent, do you want to answer?

522
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:42,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.

523
00:56:42,691 --> 00:56:42,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

524
00:56:42,911 --> 00:56:57,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I was going to say in terms of the colors, when I think about the original metrics, when the metrics technical team met and we looked at the specific scenarios and cases by schools,

525
00:56:58,170 --> 00:57:07,553
[SPEAKER_06]: all of that information that the group worked on at that point in time, we have not strayed away from those recommended scenarios.

526
00:57:08,153 --> 00:57:21,177
[SPEAKER_06]: So that if at one of the elementary schools, which currently has approximately 250 students, you know, whether it's cohort B day, AB or AC,

527
00:57:22,737 --> 00:57:34,703
[SPEAKER_06]: if you were to end up with, you know, like six cases or six students testing, you know, throughout in different classrooms, six different classrooms, we would do what we've been doing all along.

528
00:57:34,943 --> 00:57:40,246
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's within a classroom, we would, you know, isolate or quarantine the classroom.

529
00:57:40,286 --> 00:57:47,229
[SPEAKER_06]: But once we hit that number, we would revert back to what was stated in that document.

530
00:57:47,689 --> 00:57:49,170
[SPEAKER_06]: So if the magic number

531
00:57:49,763 --> 00:58:14,369
[SPEAKER_06]: was six students, then that would be the number, that would be the number that we would work with to say at, you know, I don't wanna say a school's name, but at so-and-so school, there were six positive cases within one day or two days as a result of, you know, a significant uptick

532
00:58:15,382 --> 00:58:20,086
[SPEAKER_06]: at the school level, then we would, you know, make that appropriate decision.

533
00:58:20,326 --> 00:58:26,292
[SPEAKER_06]: But thus far, we haven't had a situation where we've had multiple

534
00:58:28,169 --> 00:58:48,954
[SPEAKER_06]: cases in one specific building, which was why we just wanted to show the data that we have at this point in time, where for October and for November, four students and five students over the course of an entire month, that's the data and spread out between four different schools.

535
00:58:49,674 --> 00:58:54,215
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the reasoning behind that.

536
00:58:56,987 --> 00:59:02,232
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to talk about section three in just a second, but my question is about section two.

537
00:59:02,592 --> 00:59:05,215
[SPEAKER_05]: So community health metrics.

538
00:59:05,455 --> 00:59:09,539
[SPEAKER_05]: In the original plan, red meant remote.

539
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:16,306
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think what member McLaughlin was asking is, does red equal remote?

540
00:59:17,561 --> 00:59:24,445
[SPEAKER_11]: the governor has stated four weeks in red, then you need to evaluate whether you should go remote.

541
00:59:24,926 --> 00:59:26,807
[SPEAKER_11]: So red does not mean remote.

542
00:59:28,408 --> 00:59:31,610
[SPEAKER_06]: It does not, red does not mean remote.

543
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:35,852
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so- It doesn't mean per se remote.

544
00:59:36,693 --> 00:59:41,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct, it means somebody would need to make a decision, right?

545
00:59:41,576 --> 00:59:46,359
[SPEAKER_14]: After extended period of time in red, but it does not mean, and really nothing means

546
00:59:46,926 --> 00:59:52,691
[SPEAKER_14]: remote per se, or per se remote, depending on which teacher taught you that phrase.

547
00:59:52,811 --> 01:00:07,103
[SPEAKER_14]: But it is a combination of factors, which is sort of consistent with this overall criteria, that it is a totality of the circumstances analysis that takes into account these three prongs.

548
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:14,249
[SPEAKER_14]: The readiness of the schools, which we can somewhat control, the community numbers at large,

549
01:00:14,853 --> 01:00:17,555
[SPEAKER_14]: and what's happening within the school communities.

550
01:00:17,715 --> 01:00:23,678
[SPEAKER_14]: And for none of those things, is there a single variable that would trigger the transition to remote?

551
01:00:24,358 --> 01:00:31,642
[SPEAKER_14]: Evaluating it in four weeks of remote that the governor stated, as the mayor just said, that would certainly happen.

552
01:00:32,162 --> 01:00:37,145
[SPEAKER_14]: But if we're deep into the red, we wouldn't wait to assess this until week four.

553
01:00:37,205 --> 01:00:39,947
[SPEAKER_14]: We would be assessing it on an ongoing basis.

554
01:00:40,607 --> 01:00:42,528
[SPEAKER_14]: And certainly after four weeks,

555
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:51,336
[SPEAKER_14]: there would need to be a deeper discussion, but the discussion would build because we have to be vigilant about this and be looking at this continuously.

556
01:00:51,797 --> 01:00:59,783
[SPEAKER_14]: But there is, I think that for the community's benefit, they should know there is no single variable that will trigger a district wide transition to remote.

557
01:01:00,163 --> 01:01:08,810
[SPEAKER_14]: And the reason for that is everything has to be weighed together under the totality of the circumstances and at different points, different prongs will be weighed more heavily.

558
01:01:08,830 --> 01:01:09,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

559
01:01:10,187 --> 01:01:16,189
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what I thought this was actually saying, but it doesn't say that explicitly.

560
01:01:16,349 --> 01:01:28,253
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's important for the community to understand explicitly that our color status from the state does not mean we must do anything in our schools.

561
01:01:28,893 --> 01:01:38,897
[SPEAKER_05]: So to put it on the chart, I think it's important, but I think it needs to include language that talks about the fact that

562
01:01:40,214 --> 01:01:49,479
[SPEAKER_05]: These metrics are, there's nothing about this color coding that drives a decision automatically.

563
01:01:49,499 --> 01:01:53,360
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that needs to be clear on the document.

564
01:01:54,021 --> 01:02:03,565
[SPEAKER_05]: I also think it needs to be clear on the document what happens when we do sort of get to the point of having to make a decision.

565
01:02:03,825 --> 01:02:08,828
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we end up in red, for example,

566
01:02:09,868 --> 01:02:24,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, does that mean that the superintendent is going to bring a recommendation in collaboration with the Board of Health to this committee where we will have a discussion and take a vote?

567
01:02:25,161 --> 01:02:32,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is this proposal saying you alone will make this decision?

568
01:02:36,472 --> 01:02:50,016
[SPEAKER_06]: All the work that I have been doing has always been in collaboration with the team and in collaboration with guidance from the Board of Health and working closely with our Director of Nursing, Nurse Toni Rae.

569
01:02:51,336 --> 01:02:58,218
[SPEAKER_06]: If a decision like that, based on a shift in data, I would definitely communicate with the school committee as well.

570
01:02:58,778 --> 01:03:14,317
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be an emergency communication or a phone call, we would definitely communicate with you so I don't want the school committee to feel that they would not be looped in or notified of a significant shift.

571
01:03:15,918 --> 01:03:17,699
[SPEAKER_06]: We are closely looking at the data.

572
01:03:18,139 --> 01:03:19,479
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe strongly in data.

573
01:03:19,519 --> 01:03:22,460
[SPEAKER_06]: The data can do its own talking all by itself.

574
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:33,683
[SPEAKER_06]: But if something like that were to happen, we would make a decision based on what the data is saying, but we would definitely include all stakeholders.

575
01:03:34,323 --> 01:04:01,030
[SPEAKER_06]: So if that were to be something where we needed, like back in, to say there's been a shift, the governor has said Massachusetts is no longer red, Massachusetts is now purple, and shutting down all schools, we would notify the school committee immediately, and we would call an emergency meeting and communicate first.

576
01:04:01,705 --> 01:04:11,716
[SPEAKER_06]: and in collaboration with the team, the board of health and share the information that we have so that the entire school committee would be kept abreast of what's happening.

577
01:04:12,437 --> 01:04:17,002
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and I appreciate that sort of if the governor says

578
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:18,955
[SPEAKER_05]: sort of hands down, right?

579
01:04:19,015 --> 01:04:31,961
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think what I'm getting at is there is a difference between you giving us a heads up of a decision that you've made and you asking this committee to collaborate on the best path forward.

580
01:04:33,181 --> 01:04:42,526
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanna be clear what you are recommending tonight so that I can determine how I will vote.

581
01:04:43,703 --> 01:04:47,206
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wanna understand, are you going in those situations?

582
01:04:47,386 --> 01:04:52,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you coming to this committee where we will listen to the experts?

583
01:04:52,791 --> 01:04:56,454
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe anybody on this committee is suggesting that we not listen to the experts.

584
01:04:56,494 --> 01:05:01,479
[SPEAKER_05]: So I take complete exception to continued references that people are not listening to experts.

585
01:05:02,179 --> 01:05:07,904
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this committee wants to listen to the experts and has tried to do so pragmatically and carefully.

586
01:05:08,901 --> 01:05:20,738
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think that this is a decision that has wide impact on our community and the purpose of the school committee presiding over the schools is so that the entire community has a voice.

587
01:05:21,708 --> 01:05:29,555
[SPEAKER_05]: and a way to engage in what is really important to them as it relates to sending their children to school.

588
01:05:30,295 --> 01:05:36,841
[SPEAKER_05]: If you are making a decision and you are informing us, there is no collaboration or discussion.

589
01:05:36,861 --> 01:05:40,324
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not saying that is or isn't a good thing.

590
01:05:40,524 --> 01:05:44,547
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just asking to be crystal clear what you are asking us to approve.

591
01:05:45,648 --> 01:05:50,012
[SPEAKER_11]: If I may, we took a vote as a committee to give the administration

592
01:05:50,542 --> 01:05:52,143
[SPEAKER_11]: Maryann O'Connor and Ms.

593
01:05:52,223 --> 01:05:54,364
[SPEAKER_11]: Ray, that authority.

594
01:05:54,985 --> 01:05:58,207
[SPEAKER_05]: So- We gave them the authority to proceed with the staggered hybrid.

595
01:06:00,668 --> 01:06:03,590
[SPEAKER_05]: That is different than blanket authority forevermore.

596
01:06:04,270 --> 01:06:11,775
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm asking so that we are all clear about what and who and how we will make this decision.

597
01:06:14,656 --> 01:06:15,577
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Van de Kloop.

598
01:06:16,864 --> 01:06:18,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I actually am not done.

599
01:06:18,484 --> 01:06:21,165
[SPEAKER_05]: I was hoping for an answer to that question and I have several more.

600
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:28,066
[SPEAKER_11]: I would think that the administration and Ms.

601
01:06:28,146 --> 01:06:28,826
[SPEAKER_11]: O'Connor and Ms.

602
01:06:28,886 --> 01:06:33,227
[SPEAKER_11]: Ray would be fully capable of making that decision.

603
01:06:33,267 --> 01:06:40,128
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my personal opinion, but I'm sure the committee thinks has an individual opinion on that.

604
01:06:40,708 --> 01:06:46,289
[SPEAKER_05]: So when the motion asks us to approve this plan, what is this plan that we're approving in this regard?

605
01:06:48,471 --> 01:06:51,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I make a point of information or information, Miss McLaughlin?

606
01:06:52,156 --> 01:06:52,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

607
01:06:52,537 --> 01:06:58,244
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a couple of things that I want to sort of ask in response to this.

608
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:04,663
[SPEAKER_09]: query really is, you know, are we getting any public participation on this call?

609
01:07:05,564 --> 01:07:09,406
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to hear from community members, frankly, we do have a community member whose hand is raised.

610
01:07:10,387 --> 01:07:13,148
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I did see that Mr. Murphy just raised his hand as well.

611
01:07:13,248 --> 01:07:20,233
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd like to sort of, I'm trying to really listen to everyone's perspective here and including member Graham.

612
01:07:20,253 --> 01:07:24,215
[SPEAKER_09]: So I wanna make sure that we're able to hear from community members as well.

613
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:32,918
[SPEAKER_11]: let member Graham continue and then we have two hands raised as well as member Vandekloot did raise her hand so we'll take it in that order.

614
01:07:35,761 --> 01:07:38,744
[SPEAKER_06]: So in response to your first question, member Graham,

615
01:07:41,640 --> 01:08:09,925
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna respond with a word that, and I don't want it to be taken out of context, but I am gonna say, I would like to ask the entire school committee to place their trust in me, that as a parent, as an educator of over 25 years, I am not trying to put anyone's life or health at risk, that I am gonna prioritize education

616
01:08:10,786 --> 01:08:15,290
[SPEAKER_06]: I love school, and I'm very happy seeing kids in school.

617
01:08:15,951 --> 01:08:25,720
[SPEAKER_06]: At this point in time, we don't have the data to support shutting down or operating differently.

618
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:27,621
[SPEAKER_06]: At this point in time, the data isn't there.

619
01:08:27,661 --> 01:08:28,903
[SPEAKER_06]: The numbers are not showing that.

620
01:08:29,761 --> 01:08:30,842
[SPEAKER_15]: And a personal privilege.

621
01:08:31,503 --> 01:08:44,177
[SPEAKER_06]: I would, I would like to trust the school committee to be able to trust that I would be able to make a sound decision, but a personal privilege of information member Russo, actually, it's a point of personal privilege.

622
01:08:45,098 --> 01:08:50,945
[SPEAKER_16]: I every meeting, we are continuously the school committee members, all of us are being

623
01:08:52,512 --> 01:08:58,877
[SPEAKER_16]: attacked, frankly, that we don't want schools open, that we don't trust the administration, that we don't trust the Board of Health.

624
01:08:59,338 --> 01:09:03,461
[SPEAKER_16]: And literally, if you want to go watch all those videos again, none of us are saying that.

625
01:09:03,902 --> 01:09:06,184
[SPEAKER_16]: It is offensive, and it's got to stop.

626
01:09:06,264 --> 01:09:11,588
[SPEAKER_16]: Either it's not a school committee member, and there's probably in this entire nation that doesn't want kids back in school.

627
01:09:12,069 --> 01:09:15,752
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's a drum that is being beat endlessly, and it is offensive.

628
01:09:20,194 --> 01:09:21,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information, member McLaughlin.

629
01:09:22,036 --> 01:09:27,840
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to say, you know, with all due respect to the chair I disagree with member Russo here.

630
01:09:27,921 --> 01:09:36,368
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that there's been a lot of emotion and a lot of heated back and forth on both parts, frankly, and I think that we really need to put the children first.

631
01:09:36,948 --> 01:09:38,849
[SPEAKER_09]: and not make this personal with anybody.

632
01:09:39,269 --> 01:09:43,970
[SPEAKER_09]: So not school committee members, not the board of health, not the administration.

633
01:09:44,070 --> 01:09:48,252
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we are all here trying our damnedest to do the best for every single one of our kids.

634
01:09:48,292 --> 01:09:56,494
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have to say, I think that the superintendent has been leading that charge and that has been, this is probably the most difficult job anybody has been in.

635
01:09:56,875 --> 01:10:00,996
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have to speak on that behalf and say, I don't think we should be making this personal.

636
01:10:01,316 --> 01:10:03,477
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think anybody's attacking anybody or if they are,

637
01:10:04,637 --> 01:10:11,600
[SPEAKER_09]: request that we're not, and that we're really thinking about how we're all in this together, and we're really all trying to think about the best interest of all of our children.

638
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:13,020
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of order.

639
01:10:14,101 --> 01:10:15,641
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

640
01:10:15,921 --> 01:10:17,382
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of order, Member Rousseau.

641
01:10:17,402 --> 01:10:20,463
[SPEAKER_16]: Points of personal privilege are not to be responded to.

642
01:10:20,483 --> 01:10:24,904
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to reiterate that as part of Robert's rules.

643
01:10:25,725 --> 01:10:26,285
[SPEAKER_11]: Overruled.

644
01:10:27,986 --> 01:10:30,026
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Edward Vincent, would you like to finish?

645
01:10:30,066 --> 01:10:31,607
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I think Mr. Murphy wanted to

646
01:10:33,890 --> 01:10:57,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, as I was saying, I do trust my judgment and my experience that if I had to call school, if that was a decision that had to be made, I would make that decision, but in collaboration with feedback from my colleagues, listening to the guidance of the board of health and working closely with our director, Tony Ray of nursing.

647
01:11:00,161 --> 01:11:15,328
[SPEAKER_06]: I would also make it a point not after the fact to communicate early and clearly to the school committee that if we we saw a shift in the data, and that things were changing that that something possibly could be happening, I would.

648
01:11:16,128 --> 01:11:26,417
[SPEAKER_06]: make that commitment to get that message across to you as soon as it was something that seemed like it could be a decision that was going to be made in the near future.

649
01:11:27,017 --> 01:11:35,104
[SPEAKER_06]: But part of the responsibility of running the school district is to be able to make the difficult decisions

650
01:11:35,924 --> 01:11:41,385
[SPEAKER_06]: and I know that I can call any of you, speak with you and bring it to you as well.

651
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:47,786
[SPEAKER_06]: But it is part of what is expected of a superintendent and I am prepared to do that.

652
01:11:48,347 --> 01:11:53,828
[SPEAKER_06]: I am prepared to make those difficult decisions if that were to need to happen.

653
01:11:56,748 --> 01:11:57,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

654
01:11:58,769 --> 01:12:00,909
[SPEAKER_05]: I still have questions.

655
01:12:03,270 --> 01:12:04,690
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy and I'm happy to

656
01:12:06,348 --> 01:12:08,449
[SPEAKER_05]: take turns, but I still have questions.

657
01:12:08,609 --> 01:12:09,810
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know how you want it.

658
01:12:10,090 --> 01:12:11,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want me just to finish my questions?

659
01:12:14,153 --> 01:12:15,514
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you do have the floor.

660
01:12:15,914 --> 01:12:18,876
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Murphy, did you want to respond to that answer by Member Graham?

661
01:12:19,436 --> 01:12:21,117
[SPEAKER_14]: Two points about the question that Ms.

662
01:12:21,137 --> 01:12:21,738
[SPEAKER_14]: Graham raised.

663
01:12:21,978 --> 01:12:30,523
[SPEAKER_14]: One, there was a question as to whether we should explicitly say that there's no one variable that would trigger a transition to remote.

664
01:12:30,863 --> 01:12:33,325
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that is articulated in slide four

665
01:12:33,942 --> 01:12:35,543
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's a quote from the CDC.

666
01:12:35,623 --> 01:12:40,847
[SPEAKER_14]: So my recommendation would be to take that language and incorporate it into the dashboard.

667
01:12:40,908 --> 01:12:48,694
[SPEAKER_14]: So there is that clarifying piece that while these are the three prongs, none of those prongs are dispositive in their own right.

668
01:12:49,014 --> 01:12:53,177
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that will provide the clarity for people looking at the dashboard for that purpose.

669
01:12:53,517 --> 01:13:00,523
[SPEAKER_14]: And just with regard to the actual decision, to the superintendent's point, we monitor this continuously.

670
01:13:00,942 --> 01:13:17,631
[SPEAKER_14]: And there have been instances, and I recognize we're talking mostly about a district-wide transition to remote, but there have been instances in which the superintendent has needed to decide, because of transportation and communication implications, on extremely short notice to transition a program into remote.

671
01:13:18,051 --> 01:13:23,053
[SPEAKER_14]: It is not inconceivable that something of that nature could happen on a much larger scale.

672
01:13:23,373 --> 01:13:28,336
[SPEAKER_14]: And for that reason, the superintendent has to retain the authority to make that decision

673
01:13:28,935 --> 01:13:38,102
[SPEAKER_14]: on a very short term, sometimes a matter of hours, to which a deliberative body like the school committee is not equipped to necessarily convene to make that decision.

674
01:13:38,462 --> 01:13:45,547
[SPEAKER_14]: That being said, we have this agenda item on the agenda at every meeting, and this discussion takes place.

675
01:13:45,987 --> 01:13:56,655
[SPEAKER_14]: And for that reason, and the committee's privilege to convene on 48 hours notice or less in the case of an emergency, the committee certainly can convene

676
01:13:57,348 --> 01:14:02,593
[SPEAKER_14]: and make this decision because of the district-wide implications that could happen.

677
01:14:02,633 --> 01:14:16,984
[SPEAKER_14]: But in that circumstance where the deliberative body needs to assemble on such short notice, in all likelihood, the superintendent would have already had a responsibility to make a decision of some kind for purposes of safety.

678
01:14:17,365 --> 01:14:21,148
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think the point is a little moot in that we're convening

679
01:14:21,723 --> 01:14:26,987
[SPEAKER_14]: either every week or every other week discussing this agenda topic with the superintendent and the school committee present.

680
01:14:27,027 --> 01:14:30,029
[SPEAKER_14]: And so that dialogue and that discourse is going to continue.

681
01:14:30,089 --> 01:14:38,395
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not like this is a situation where the committee can't convene for an extended period of time and therefore only the superintendent can make that decision.

682
01:14:38,435 --> 01:14:42,317
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think the point is that this is monitored on a daily basis.

683
01:14:42,658 --> 01:14:48,702
[SPEAKER_14]: If the superintendent needs to make the decision, she certainly can, she will, and frankly, in the case of some programs, she has.

684
01:14:49,293 --> 01:14:56,217
[SPEAKER_14]: and the committee will continue to convene on a regular basis and discuss this issue because of its importance and because of its district-wide implications.

685
01:14:58,158 --> 01:15:04,121
[SPEAKER_05]: So I feel like we are sort of muddying section two and section three.

686
01:15:04,141 --> 01:15:10,304
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm gonna ask my questions about section three and then I'll circle back to section two.

687
01:15:11,205 --> 01:15:16,768
[SPEAKER_05]: In section three, what I wanted to say is that I,

688
01:15:17,225 --> 01:15:24,309
[SPEAKER_05]: want to commend A, the fact that our transmission has been so low, even as we have brought people back.

689
01:15:24,369 --> 01:15:25,650
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that is commendable.

690
01:15:25,770 --> 01:15:34,396
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is a testament to the hard work and the really thoughtful, pragmatic ways that you are making these decisions every single day.

691
01:15:34,556 --> 01:15:44,322
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't want anybody on this call to think that I disagree with your decisions to date about programs,

692
01:15:45,504 --> 01:15:47,925
[SPEAKER_05]: that have to go remote for various reasons.

693
01:15:48,306 --> 01:15:58,612
[SPEAKER_05]: And to my knowledge, your decision-making has been exactly what I would have done myself, which is there is no more trust than that.

694
01:15:59,365 --> 01:16:15,814
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wanna say that in section, as it relates to section three, I think we did a lot of hard work collaboratively as an organization and with community members and with community input to really sort of flush out those scenarios and they're working.

695
01:16:16,574 --> 01:16:18,475
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wanna see them continue to work.

696
01:16:19,376 --> 01:16:21,677
[SPEAKER_05]: What I would ask in section three

697
01:16:22,402 --> 01:16:46,515
[SPEAKER_05]: is that we circle back to the intent of what is in the language in section three, and that instead of this blurb that is here, that is not super meaningful week to week, that this section three going forward outline whether there are buildings where there are special conditions happening.

698
01:16:46,735 --> 01:16:50,997
[SPEAKER_05]: So for example, the McGlynn Middle School

699
01:16:51,752 --> 01:16:58,716
[SPEAKER_05]: there is a sixth grade classroom or the Brooks Elementary School, there is a third grade classroom.

700
01:16:59,257 --> 01:17:11,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Something that gives people who come to look at this dashboard, some indication of what is happening across the district on a regular week for those programs that have had to be sent home remote.

701
01:17:12,165 --> 01:17:16,848
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not, the goal of that is so that

702
01:17:17,813 --> 01:17:32,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone just doesn't sort of run around on pins and needles wondering when the shoe is going to drop when they're going to get a phone call when somebody is going to make a decision, but instead we are doing this, we are following our own rules in this particular instance section three.

703
01:17:33,105 --> 01:17:35,206
[SPEAKER_05]: All I'm asking is that we outline them here.

704
01:17:35,346 --> 01:17:41,489
[SPEAKER_05]: So if the motion that goes forward, if this needs to be a separate motion, that's fine.

705
01:17:42,089 --> 01:17:45,390
[SPEAKER_05]: If it needs to be part of the complete motion, that's fine.

706
01:17:45,970 --> 01:17:52,653
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do think it's really important that this section outline what was intended of the section.

707
01:17:52,693 --> 01:17:57,855
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel like I can speak about the intent of the section because I helped author it.

708
01:17:57,975 --> 01:18:01,397
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know what we intended to put here

709
01:18:02,606 --> 01:18:15,450
[SPEAKER_05]: I want the community to have the benefit of seeing the hard work that we are doing to keep community spread and school spread low by making good decisions as those situations come up.

710
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:25,812
[SPEAKER_05]: So as it relates to section three, the superintendent, according to our rules, has always had the complete authority to make these decisions.

711
01:18:25,872 --> 01:18:28,713
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think there's any reason to change section three.

712
01:18:29,613 --> 01:18:31,054
[SPEAKER_05]: What I am asking about

713
01:18:32,302 --> 01:18:43,812
[SPEAKER_05]: is when we are making decisions based on section two, that is outside of just the scope and control of the superintendent or frankly the school committee.

714
01:18:44,472 --> 01:18:53,901
[SPEAKER_05]: That is where we are saying what is happening in our community is noteworthy enough for us to make a decision about schools.

715
01:18:54,481 --> 01:18:55,602
[SPEAKER_05]: And in that case,

716
01:18:57,210 --> 01:19:02,553
[SPEAKER_05]: I do actually think it's reasonable to want to collaborate in some fashion about that decision.

717
01:19:04,193 --> 01:19:20,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether my colleagues agree with me or not remains to be seen, but I would say if we can make an update to the language so that we are clear that red doesn't mean anything nor does any other color in isolation.

718
01:19:21,162 --> 01:19:23,563
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we should remove the conclusion

719
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:31,023
[SPEAKER_05]: because I think the conclusion implies that the colors mean something and alone they do not.

720
01:19:33,044 --> 01:19:39,907
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that what people are really wanting to know is who and how will this decision get made.

721
01:19:40,127 --> 01:19:45,329
[SPEAKER_05]: So for example, we just said the governor has said if you're in red for four weeks,

722
01:19:46,519 --> 01:19:48,359
[SPEAKER_05]: then you should be talking about this.

723
01:19:48,879 --> 01:20:02,242
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that would be worth putting on this dashboard so people understand that that is the point at which they could expect some sort of action to change outside of what is happening in our schools, right?

724
01:20:04,122 --> 01:20:12,644
[SPEAKER_05]: And back to like the issue of who makes this decision because this decision is not

725
01:20:13,151 --> 01:20:14,973
[SPEAKER_05]: solely about what happens in schools.

726
01:20:15,153 --> 01:20:22,959
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not solely about making a fast decision based on staffing, transportation, whatever have you.

727
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:30,165
[SPEAKER_05]: All I'm asking is that we have a collaborative discussion about that on a regular basis when the time comes.

728
01:20:31,334 --> 01:20:33,395
[SPEAKER_05]: I am not asking you to close schools.

729
01:20:33,555 --> 01:20:37,618
[SPEAKER_05]: I am from four people this weekend that we were gonna make a decision tonight to go remote.

730
01:20:38,238 --> 01:20:43,821
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe that we're making that kind of decision and I don't believe that's ever been discussed as a reason for this meeting.

731
01:20:44,441 --> 01:20:51,525
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is what happens when we're not clear about how we plan to use the data.

732
01:20:52,045 --> 01:21:00,330
[SPEAKER_05]: All I'm asking is that we be clear about how we use the data and who will be making this decision and that this committee tonight

733
01:21:01,048 --> 01:21:04,631
[SPEAKER_05]: vote on how those decisions will be made going forward.

734
01:21:05,972 --> 01:21:06,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that make sense?

735
01:21:16,505 --> 01:21:29,405
[SPEAKER_06]: I, I listened to what you were saying and I guess, as I'm hearing you speak about section two, and I know that you were deeply involved with us as part of the team on section three.

736
01:21:32,148 --> 01:21:47,917
[SPEAKER_06]: When I think about the entire three areas, we're not looking at one particular category or metrics in isolation and referring back to the quote that was there, that probably wouldn't be a wise move to do.

737
01:21:48,057 --> 01:21:59,703
[SPEAKER_06]: But if a decision has to be made, whether it's based on section three or a decision that's made based on section two, I still feel that I should be able to make that decision in collaboration

738
01:22:00,828 --> 01:22:03,730
[SPEAKER_06]: with my team and communicate it out to the school committee.

739
01:22:04,391 --> 01:22:12,957
[SPEAKER_06]: So I still feel that that should be the same approach, whether it's section one, section two, or section three.

740
01:22:13,938 --> 01:22:18,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I ask a point of information, Mayor?

741
01:22:18,701 --> 01:22:29,329
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure that everybody is following section one, two, and three, so maybe we can just use a title for each of those since we don't have the document up in front of us, but if folks could just, you know, section one,

742
01:22:30,049 --> 01:22:31,449
[SPEAKER_09]: is, you know, this section two.

743
01:22:32,930 --> 01:22:33,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

744
01:22:34,330 --> 01:22:39,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Building classroom readiness, section two is Medford community health metrics.

745
01:22:39,791 --> 01:22:44,773
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where we had the color coded red, yellow, green and gray.

746
01:22:45,373 --> 01:22:49,054
[SPEAKER_06]: And section three is district and school specific conditions.

747
01:22:54,855 --> 01:22:55,155
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

748
01:22:56,053 --> 01:22:57,834
[SPEAKER_11]: we have four residents.

749
01:22:58,274 --> 01:23:01,115
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Van de Kloot, do you wanna go before the four residents?

750
01:23:01,135 --> 01:23:01,815
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

751
01:23:02,175 --> 01:23:15,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I know they've been waiting an awful long time, but what I would do is I could just ask Member Graham one question for clarification, and then if you would call upon me after we let the residents speak, I don't want them to have to wait any longer.

752
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:23,704
[SPEAKER_07]: But the clarification is, Jenny, you mentioned maybe I should make an amendment, maybe it should be a new resolution, but I wasn't sure what,

753
01:23:25,104 --> 01:23:29,465
[SPEAKER_07]: precisely you are either amending or what your resolution would be.

754
01:23:29,525 --> 01:23:32,446
[SPEAKER_07]: So could you give us the wording so we understand?

755
01:23:33,887 --> 01:23:34,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

756
01:23:34,227 --> 01:23:42,369
[SPEAKER_05]: So as the superintendent pointed out in our last meeting, we never voted to change what is listed as section three.

757
01:23:42,609 --> 01:23:45,730
[SPEAKER_05]: So section three is district and school specific conditions.

758
01:23:46,171 --> 01:23:47,251
[SPEAKER_05]: It currently reads

759
01:23:47,879 --> 01:23:50,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Our top priority is to monitor the safety of our students.

760
01:23:50,461 --> 01:24:02,290
[SPEAKER_05]: We will use the Medford Board of Health and MPS managing local COVID conditions in our school buildings framework to guide our decision-making as we work with the Medford Board of Health to recommend plans and next steps as cases are identified.

761
01:24:02,350 --> 01:24:12,057
[SPEAKER_05]: We will follow state-issued guidelines in regards to notification testing, quarantine protocols, and COVID-19 positive persons and close contacts before a final decision is made.

762
01:24:12,661 --> 01:24:17,887
[SPEAKER_05]: On the district or school closure, the superintendent must advise Jesse and will communicate with the school committee.

763
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:31,862
[SPEAKER_05]: So the point the intent of this section was that there was a box that could say, for example, there's a special condition right school specific condition that exists in a certain building so it's you know.

764
01:24:32,874 --> 01:24:36,297
[SPEAKER_05]: School A, and it's a classroom in grade three.

765
01:24:36,457 --> 01:24:41,881
[SPEAKER_05]: So that if somebody comes out here and takes a look at it, they understand, does that apply to me or does it not apply to me?

766
01:24:42,081 --> 01:24:44,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it apply to my child or does it not apply to my child?

767
01:24:44,843 --> 01:24:53,590
[SPEAKER_05]: And it also gives the community at any given time, a glance at what are all these decisions that we have made to keep our students safe?

768
01:24:54,528 --> 01:24:55,448
[SPEAKER_05]: across the system.

769
01:24:55,668 --> 01:25:14,252
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I'm asking is that a box be added, the language is fine, but the box that is added should reflect those classrooms, programs, grades, whatever they are, that are full remote because of a decision that the superintendent has made.

770
01:25:14,272 --> 01:25:22,573
[SPEAKER_05]: So all I'm asking is that as those decisions are made and somebody is sent home remote for some amount of time, that it be listed.

771
01:25:23,327 --> 01:25:39,044
[SPEAKER_07]: So to clarify, if there was the Brooks School classroom, second grade was sent home, it would say, you know, so sort of a red flag, current closures, Brooks School, grade two.

772
01:25:39,989 --> 01:25:42,690
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we- Select grade two or something like that.

773
01:25:42,710 --> 01:25:45,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, so that's just a total hypothetical to be clear.

774
01:25:46,152 --> 01:25:55,916
[SPEAKER_07]: But then the question is when we do that, and this goes back to Marianne, is the whole confidentiality issue.

775
01:25:57,157 --> 01:26:08,401
[SPEAKER_07]: And are we really giving people more, I mean, if grade two is closed at whatever school, okay, wouldn't automatically, you know,

776
01:26:10,197 --> 01:26:16,458
[SPEAKER_07]: parents would be notified, let's face it, the school would soon know, what are you really accomplishing?

777
01:26:16,618 --> 01:26:21,320
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, yes, it is a way of, it would be one way of seeing it across the district, and from that, I like that.

778
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:30,862
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Brooks grade two, Roberts grade four, you know, Cohart C, you know, that would work.

779
01:26:31,202 --> 01:26:36,203
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the value is to be able to see it across the district to,

780
01:26:37,402 --> 01:26:44,347
[SPEAKER_05]: provide information for families so that they understand that we are making good rational decisions about this stuff.

781
01:26:45,208 --> 01:26:51,093
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and frankly, as you said that I would rather us.

782
01:26:52,340 --> 01:27:04,047
[SPEAKER_05]: publish official information, then allow that information to go out by the rumor mill, which generates the calls that say, hey, I heard you were going to make a decision to send everybody remote.

783
01:27:04,607 --> 01:27:12,932
[SPEAKER_05]: All I'm suggesting is that being clear and upfront about this stuff allows Medford Public Schools to

784
01:27:14,168 --> 01:27:21,251
[SPEAKER_05]: overwhelmingly be the source of information on what is happening in our schools, rather than allowing that out to social media.

785
01:27:21,391 --> 01:27:31,435
[SPEAKER_07]: So if the box said, or if the next current closures, okay, so the box said current closures, and right now, do we have any closures, superintendent?

786
01:27:38,038 --> 01:27:40,259
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me ask the confidentiality question first.

787
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:48,846
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr Murphy yet has we have we may have a program that is remote right now that it would not be ideal to identify so.

788
01:27:49,466 --> 01:28:10,582
[SPEAKER_14]: And that is often going to be the case, so I think that we share the desire for transparency and I think there is value in the Community just that from a confidence perspective, seeing as these sort of situations accumulate, but I don't see the value in identifying a specific grade level because if there's a grade level or.

789
01:28:11,202 --> 01:28:15,765
[SPEAKER_14]: some demo constituency of students that has been transitioned to remote in a school.

790
01:28:16,286 --> 01:28:17,927
[SPEAKER_14]: I think to miss predicates point.

791
01:28:18,987 --> 01:28:37,140
[SPEAKER_14]: Every people who need to know that information going to have it and we can provide equally helpful information to the community by not getting into the level of specificity as to which grade level it is or which are certainly which program it is and so

792
01:28:38,130 --> 01:28:41,371
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that we could, and I would, again, I'd like to hear from Ms.

793
01:28:41,431 --> 01:28:52,953
[SPEAKER_14]: O'Connor on it, but I think we could say and have this, what is essentially like a tracking system so people can see what's gone remote and identify something happened in a school.

794
01:28:53,013 --> 01:29:01,394
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not telling you how many students, we're not telling you how old they were, we're not telling you anything else really, but the Brooks has got something that went remote, the Roberts has something that went remote and so on and so forth.

795
01:29:01,754 --> 01:29:05,575
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't personally see how that would be a potential

796
01:29:06,873 --> 01:29:08,134
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, privacy invasion.

797
01:29:08,154 --> 01:29:12,195
[SPEAKER_14]: But again, Miss O'Connor is the HIPAA licensed person.

798
01:29:12,235 --> 01:29:19,498
[SPEAKER_14]: So, but that seems to me like it would both give the community some information without going down the road that I think we all want to avoid.

799
01:29:19,518 --> 01:29:23,380
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree wholeheartedly with that, Dave.

800
01:29:23,540 --> 01:29:26,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Giving a building situation is fine.

801
01:29:26,601 --> 01:29:29,703
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the fact that we are hybrid now, the classes are very small, right?

802
01:29:29,723 --> 01:29:30,403
[SPEAKER_08]: They're split in half.

803
01:29:30,423 --> 01:29:35,025
[SPEAKER_08]: So going down to a class level at a hybrid level or a cohort level, that's

804
01:29:35,501 --> 01:29:37,602
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be, I would not recommend that.

805
01:29:37,962 --> 01:29:48,929
[SPEAKER_14]: But a school community is, you know, they're all, I mean, just to be clear, we do have a school, one school community that is very small in terms of its total student population.

806
01:29:48,989 --> 01:29:50,870
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that would have to be exempted somehow.

807
01:29:50,910 --> 01:29:52,571
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't see how we can identify.

808
01:29:52,971 --> 01:29:58,975
[SPEAKER_14]: But with that exception, I think everywhere else we're talking about hundreds of people.

809
01:29:59,775 --> 01:30:01,956
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that would be unsafe ground.

810
01:30:02,677 --> 01:30:03,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I think if we,

811
01:30:05,387 --> 01:30:17,016
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, created an asterisk that said that we are not reporting, you know, we are not reporting special conditions due to confidentiality issues at a given building.

812
01:30:17,136 --> 01:30:17,977
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's fine.

813
01:30:18,077 --> 01:30:33,969
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's really a really reasonable way to provide information that is not going to disclose anybody's confidential information, but still provide the community at large some information

814
01:30:34,559 --> 01:30:38,540
[SPEAKER_05]: about what is going on across the system, that would be helpful.

815
01:30:38,961 --> 01:31:00,788
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I think the one, and I'm sorry to make this even more complicated, but like, if I think that is a necessary thing for the particular school we're referring to, but I think the same rationale could be extended to most of the programs in cohort A. There is a higher level of privacy at issue, and some of the programs have very few students enrolled.

816
01:31:01,337 --> 01:31:20,562
[SPEAKER_14]: I, so my recommendation would be that it would be school community based, but there, it essentially say not just that this particular school is exempted from this, but that essentially cohort A would be, would be exempted from this with the rationale being that if you are affected by a transition to remote, you have been, we have personally communicated with you.

817
01:31:22,142 --> 01:31:25,023
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, some, it's not, it's not cut and dry.

818
01:31:25,043 --> 01:31:26,303
[SPEAKER_14]: It's, I don't think it's black and white.

819
01:31:26,363 --> 01:31:30,404
[SPEAKER_14]: I just, I have reservations about identity, just any type of asterisk that applies to ways

820
01:31:30,820 --> 01:31:32,181
[SPEAKER_14]: one specific school community.

821
01:31:32,221 --> 01:31:38,504
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I'm trying to think about how that could be broader to provide the necessary privacy and installation.

822
01:31:38,584 --> 01:31:40,745
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if my suggestion is the answer to it or not.

823
01:31:41,245 --> 01:31:53,471
[SPEAKER_14]: There are other complexities with it, but I think there's consensus from what I'm seeing that we're not gonna identify beyond the school community level, correct?

824
01:31:53,551 --> 01:31:56,992
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say building, right?

825
01:31:57,012 --> 01:31:58,693
[SPEAKER_14]: When I say school community, I mean a building.

826
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:02,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think that's really reasonable.

827
01:32:06,101 --> 01:32:16,304
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Mayor, I actually had the floor, but I wanna get to, I know Mr. Began has had his hand up for a long time and there are others, but, and then I'd like to make a statement afterwards.

828
01:32:17,344 --> 01:32:18,965
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds great, thank you, Member Van de Kloot.

829
01:32:19,365 --> 01:32:19,965
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Began?

830
01:32:28,587 --> 01:32:29,368
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think he heard you.

831
01:32:29,648 --> 01:32:30,248
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me?

832
01:32:30,950 --> 01:32:31,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

833
01:32:31,790 --> 01:32:32,130
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, great.

834
01:32:32,851 --> 01:32:33,251
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

835
01:32:34,111 --> 01:32:36,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee.

836
01:32:37,232 --> 01:32:48,736
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I just want to say congratulations to the superintendent and her staff and to Miss O'Connor and her staff and to Miss Ray as well.

837
01:32:49,953 --> 01:32:56,960
[SPEAKER_00]: You're two months into this opening and you have one case of in-school transmission.

838
01:32:57,300 --> 01:32:58,942
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is unbelievable.

839
01:32:59,442 --> 01:33:02,945
[SPEAKER_00]: And really that's the number that, that's the only number that matters to me tonight.

840
01:33:03,366 --> 01:33:05,447
[SPEAKER_00]: You have one case of in-school transmission.

841
01:33:06,869 --> 01:33:14,516
[SPEAKER_00]: For my purposes as a parent, I don't care if there's 20 kids that show up in school and have COVID, if they all go home and no one got infected,

842
01:33:15,436 --> 01:33:22,118
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy, people are gonna get this disease, but we gotta keep opening these schools, because the kids need it really badly.

843
01:33:22,738 --> 01:33:29,820
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two daughters in high school who are ready to bust through the walls to get into that school.

844
01:33:30,761 --> 01:33:33,201
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that you continue to let it happen.

845
01:33:34,122 --> 01:33:39,383
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the person you have in charge here, there could be no better for us right now.

846
01:33:40,464 --> 01:33:44,785
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let Dr. Edward Vincent use her sound judgment

847
01:33:45,877 --> 01:33:46,937
[SPEAKER_00]: and her common sense.

848
01:33:47,918 --> 01:33:49,098
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're gonna be fine.

849
01:33:49,138 --> 01:33:53,379
[SPEAKER_00]: I think these schools are gonna keep opening and I think transmission is gonna remain low.

850
01:33:54,280 --> 01:34:00,922
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this meeting should really be a cause for celebration given the numbers we're looking at two months in.

851
01:34:00,962 --> 01:34:02,442
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.

852
01:34:05,603 --> 01:34:06,003
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

853
01:34:08,484 --> 01:34:14,866
[SPEAKER_11]: Next up, Roka.

854
01:34:16,689 --> 01:34:24,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Jean Gatza, COB Host, she or her): Yes, hello, can you hear me.

855
01:34:25,217 --> 01:34:25,397
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

856
01:34:27,057 --> 01:34:31,479
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so I would say that the principle here is not about trust.

857
01:34:31,539 --> 01:34:37,581
[SPEAKER_18]: There's been a lot of talk about trust, but this is really about the community that you serve having a voice.

858
01:34:38,041 --> 01:34:49,445
[SPEAKER_18]: So the school committee is supposed to represent us, represent families, but all decisions are now in the hands of administrators instead of there being a vote that actually reflects community voices.

859
01:34:50,145 --> 01:34:58,731
[SPEAKER_18]: And at this point in time, you may not have the data for full closure, but cases are rising exponentially and will continue to do so through the winter.

860
01:34:59,472 --> 01:35:03,395
[SPEAKER_18]: So there needs to be a plan and families need to have a say in that plan.

861
01:35:03,975 --> 01:35:10,460
[SPEAKER_18]: And to say that essentially nothing means remote is irresponsible and it gives you the room to keep changing the metrics.

862
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:13,061
[SPEAKER_18]: So how much is going to be enough, right?

863
01:35:13,121 --> 01:35:18,062
[SPEAKER_18]: So are you going to wait until hospitals are overloaded until there's no ICU beds or what?

864
01:35:18,562 --> 01:35:24,684
[SPEAKER_18]: Because at this point, you know, families really need to be able to prepare and you've given us no clarity on how to do so.

865
01:35:30,805 --> 01:35:31,646
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Miss Rooker.

866
01:35:35,987 --> 01:35:36,567
[SPEAKER_11]: Miss Moretti.

867
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:48,981
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be unmuted now.

868
01:35:49,621 --> 01:35:50,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, can you hear me?

869
01:35:50,841 --> 01:35:51,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

870
01:35:51,442 --> 01:35:51,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

871
01:35:52,102 --> 01:35:52,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thank you, Mayor.

872
01:35:53,323 --> 01:35:54,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, everybody.

873
01:35:54,843 --> 01:36:06,609
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to put out there that I do trust the superintendent and the administration and the decisions that are so difficult for them to make thus far.

874
01:36:06,769 --> 01:36:09,911
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been really grueling for everybody involved.

875
01:36:10,992 --> 01:36:17,615
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing that worries me for my junior, who's a vocational student in electrical,

876
01:36:18,438 --> 01:36:23,723
[SPEAKER_02]: is they're missing out on the hands-on, all the vocational students.

877
01:36:23,803 --> 01:36:30,068
[SPEAKER_02]: So he actually had gone in last week for two days for four hours, Thursday and Friday, and it was wonderful.

878
01:36:30,129 --> 01:36:33,792
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really, it felt really good and a little normal for once.

879
01:36:34,072 --> 01:36:38,596
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're shut down already because I believe there was one case.

880
01:36:38,636 --> 01:36:39,317
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that

881
01:36:43,957 --> 01:36:58,382
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that we have to put our trust in the superintendent and with the CDC's new information that the safest place for the kids is in school, I would have to agree.

882
01:36:58,422 --> 01:36:59,923
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really hope that that's the case.

883
01:36:59,943 --> 01:37:03,444
[SPEAKER_02]: And just going off of what the woman who spoke before said,

884
01:37:03,923 --> 01:37:14,009
[SPEAKER_02]: We might have the seven school committee members who are great, who are the voices of the people that vote for them, but remember, you vote them in and there was how many other candidates.

885
01:37:14,049 --> 01:37:17,031
[SPEAKER_02]: So they don't, they may not necessarily speak for everybody.

886
01:37:17,411 --> 01:37:19,773
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to take that into consideration too.

887
01:37:20,213 --> 01:37:26,577
[SPEAKER_02]: They do, you know, they do respond to everything well, but I think the kids really need to get back in school.

888
01:37:26,597 --> 01:37:31,440
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope that the high schoolers can get back in school finally, because it's been really long time.

889
01:37:32,467 --> 01:37:37,712
[SPEAKER_02]: but great job so far getting all the eighth graders, up to the eighth graders in, so thank you.

890
01:37:39,053 --> 01:37:39,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

891
01:37:39,994 --> 01:37:40,314
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.

892
01:37:41,776 --> 01:37:42,537
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Carbone?

893
01:37:47,281 --> 01:37:47,942
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, can you hear me?

894
01:37:49,078 --> 01:37:49,258
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

895
01:37:49,598 --> 01:37:49,798
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

896
01:37:50,139 --> 01:37:57,302
[SPEAKER_13]: My name is Christopher Carboni my daughter, Rachel attends the high school my daughter Sarah attends the school formerly known as the Columbus school.

897
01:37:57,883 --> 01:38:05,266
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I want to just reiterate what has been said by two of the last three speak, the three of the last four speakers the um, Mr vegan and Miss already.

898
01:38:05,847 --> 01:38:09,849
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, it does appear from the data, as limited as it might be.

899
01:38:10,549 --> 01:38:20,174
[SPEAKER_13]: that the safest place for a child to be in is a school that is properly following the protocols set by both the CDC and by the Commonwealth's health agencies.

900
01:38:20,474 --> 01:38:24,897
[SPEAKER_13]: That those industries, those places are doing the best work.

901
01:38:25,417 --> 01:38:34,202
[SPEAKER_13]: If you take nine students that are doing hybrid and you divide them by 1,700 students, that's half a percent.

902
01:38:35,102 --> 01:38:36,063
[SPEAKER_13]: That's half percent.

903
01:38:37,485 --> 01:38:43,729
[SPEAKER_13]: If you'd go outside the school to the day-to-day that's going out here in Medford, we're at about 1.5%.

904
01:38:45,009 --> 01:38:47,431
[SPEAKER_13]: Inside a school is three times as safe as outside the school.

905
01:38:48,111 --> 01:38:56,396
[SPEAKER_13]: If you take 1,300 students, and you take the 18 students that have got it remotely, and you divide by 1,300, that's 1.5%.

906
01:38:57,156 --> 01:38:59,117
[SPEAKER_13]: In other words, that makes complete sense.

907
01:38:59,738 --> 01:39:01,579
[SPEAKER_13]: Mathematically, it all seems to work out.

908
01:39:03,799 --> 01:39:05,941
[SPEAKER_13]: I completely agree with what Mr. Beacon said.

909
01:39:06,461 --> 01:39:07,962
[SPEAKER_13]: This is actually a cause for celebration.

910
01:39:08,883 --> 01:39:15,528
[SPEAKER_13]: Why we're not treating it like that, I think it says a lot more about what's going on with the school committee than it does anything else.

911
01:39:16,308 --> 01:39:18,490
[SPEAKER_13]: Parents should be particularly happy about this.

912
01:39:19,070 --> 01:39:24,595
[SPEAKER_13]: Medford school committee, but most importantly, the superintendent should be doing a victory lap right now.

913
01:39:25,195 --> 01:39:26,836
[SPEAKER_13]: And the parents should be grateful to them.

914
01:39:27,497 --> 01:39:28,457
[SPEAKER_13]: We came into this,

915
01:39:29,478 --> 01:39:30,278
[SPEAKER_13]: What are you going to do?

916
01:39:30,598 --> 01:39:31,399
[SPEAKER_13]: How are you going to do it?

917
01:39:31,499 --> 01:39:33,879
[SPEAKER_13]: And what are your measures going to be if it's gone right or wrong?

918
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:37,081
[SPEAKER_13]: Everything they say they've done, they've done.

919
01:39:37,901 --> 01:39:39,861
[SPEAKER_13]: They've followed all the protocols and procedures.

920
01:39:40,061 --> 01:39:44,343
[SPEAKER_13]: They've given us the metrics and we're under them consistently.

921
01:39:46,544 --> 01:39:50,545
[SPEAKER_13]: Why are we treating this like this is anything but great news?

922
01:39:52,272 --> 01:39:58,874
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I just wanna end by saying that I hope the school committee continues to follow our superintendent's lead.

923
01:39:59,334 --> 01:40:04,016
[SPEAKER_13]: She is clearly head and shoulders above the last person we had in that position.

924
01:40:04,456 --> 01:40:06,097
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it's about time someone said so.

925
01:40:07,057 --> 01:40:09,518
[SPEAKER_13]: And I feel very enthused by these numbers.

926
01:40:09,578 --> 01:40:17,120
[SPEAKER_13]: And if we're gonna all say, we go out in our day-to-day lives and we say things like, we're gonna listen to the experts and we're gonna follow the numbers.

927
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:20,521
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I suggest we start doing that, because the numbers seem pretty good.

928
01:40:23,548 --> 01:40:25,389
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Adam.

929
01:40:26,309 --> 01:40:27,490
[SPEAKER_11]: And then member Van de Kloot.

930
01:40:34,452 --> 01:40:36,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me?

931
01:40:36,833 --> 01:40:36,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

932
01:40:37,754 --> 01:40:40,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, I'm sorry, my name's Jessica, that's my son's name.

933
01:40:41,395 --> 01:40:45,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I just wanted to reiterate what Mr. Carbone, I believe his name was, just said.

934
01:40:46,577 --> 01:40:52,680
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe the superintendent and her team have been doing an amazing job

935
01:40:53,460 --> 01:40:58,443
[SPEAKER_03]: My son is in cohort A, so he's been back since the very beginning.

936
01:40:58,463 --> 01:41:03,027
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was considered at one point a close contact.

937
01:41:03,907 --> 01:41:05,488
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got notified right away.

938
01:41:05,809 --> 01:41:07,169
[SPEAKER_03]: The nurse was right on top of it.

939
01:41:07,190 --> 01:41:10,592
[SPEAKER_03]: I went right down to the school and got him.

940
01:41:11,497 --> 01:41:16,039
[SPEAKER_03]: He did have to stay home for the two weeks, but they got his work to him.

941
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:18,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything that needed to be done was done.

942
01:41:18,861 --> 01:41:20,062
[SPEAKER_03]: He got his services.

943
01:41:20,722 --> 01:41:21,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything went great.

944
01:41:22,303 --> 01:41:26,425
[SPEAKER_03]: So what they needed to do, they did very quickly.

945
01:41:26,445 --> 01:41:35,950
[SPEAKER_03]: And given that he was cohort A and it was only like two weeks in, they were right on top of it and knew exactly what to do.

946
01:41:38,331 --> 01:41:41,133
[SPEAKER_03]: I have full trust in the superintendent

947
01:41:42,683 --> 01:41:49,626
[SPEAKER_03]: and her team, they are following the guidelines, they're with the Board of Health, and they know what they're doing.

948
01:41:50,006 --> 01:41:54,147
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we need to give them that credit and let them do the work.

949
01:41:54,667 --> 01:41:55,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

950
01:41:57,469 --> 01:41:57,889
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

951
01:41:58,529 --> 01:42:04,031
[SPEAKER_11]: Member van de Kloot, and then I'll take the two additional speakers.

952
01:42:05,909 --> 01:42:06,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

953
01:42:06,989 --> 01:42:18,655
[SPEAKER_07]: So, some of the speakers made points that I wanted to make and first I will start out with Mr begins point that the really great news is just the one in school transmission.

954
01:42:19,195 --> 01:42:22,056
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's, that's just fantastic news and.

955
01:42:23,517 --> 01:42:29,443
[SPEAKER_07]: we can certainly hope that we can continue that.

956
01:42:29,903 --> 01:42:36,689
[SPEAKER_07]: To the speaker who talked about the role of the school committee and us representing, well, we do.

957
01:42:37,049 --> 01:42:45,197
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I was elected, I always take that a certain amount of people at least have enough faith in my judgment.

958
01:42:46,497 --> 01:42:55,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes we will disagree, but overall, you have listened to me enough and you have some level of faith in my thinking and in my judgment.

959
01:42:57,200 --> 01:43:04,302
[SPEAKER_07]: As a school committee member, I have watched our superintendent and her team very carefully.

960
01:43:05,662 --> 01:43:16,329
[SPEAKER_07]: We looked at the policies that we've outlined and I see them following them and working very meticulously as many of the speakers made reference to.

961
01:43:17,169 --> 01:43:26,675
[SPEAKER_07]: I have personally no reason to question her judgment on making a call if we were

962
01:43:27,568 --> 01:43:44,812
[SPEAKER_07]: facing a situation, I believe that she would evaluate with her team and with the city people, and also maybe a call to the school committee members, because we certainly would want to be kept in the loop, but I've never felt that I've not been kept in the loop by the superintendent.

963
01:43:45,252 --> 01:43:47,633
[SPEAKER_07]: But I wouldn't need to be called into a special meeting.

964
01:43:48,073 --> 01:43:55,895
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't want to put that as this body, the school committee, now would be the ones who make that decision.

965
01:43:57,815 --> 01:44:11,019
[SPEAKER_07]: I have trust that the school committee has selected our superintendent to carry out our policies and I have every reason to believe that that's what she would be doing.

966
01:44:11,199 --> 01:44:19,021
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would support the motion by my colleague and also like to thank everybody for all their

967
01:44:20,021 --> 01:44:21,542
[SPEAKER_07]: work on these issues.

968
01:44:22,302 --> 01:44:29,126
[SPEAKER_07]: I would support the clarification that member Graham spoke to.

969
01:44:30,926 --> 01:44:35,268
[SPEAKER_07]: In the general sense, not specific, because I think we went through the discussion about that.

970
01:44:35,929 --> 01:44:37,690
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I think that's good.

971
01:44:38,750 --> 01:44:42,954
[SPEAKER_07]: If you wanted to do an analogy, we could talk about snow days.

972
01:44:43,915 --> 01:44:47,058
[SPEAKER_07]: And some might say, well, Paulette, you're making it so simple.

973
01:44:47,539 --> 01:44:57,789
[SPEAKER_07]: But frankly, when there's a snow day, a superintendent makes a call with a lot of different inputs about the safety

974
01:44:58,825 --> 01:45:05,828
[SPEAKER_07]: of the travel for our students, travel for our teachers, the conditions.

975
01:45:06,388 --> 01:45:08,489
[SPEAKER_07]: She confers with other experts.

976
01:45:08,889 --> 01:45:11,150
[SPEAKER_07]: She might confer with other superintendents as well.

977
01:45:11,891 --> 01:45:15,792
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's always going to be people who are going to disagree with the superintendent.

978
01:45:16,072 --> 01:45:22,275
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's always going to be people, and luckily we've heard from some of them tonight, which is nice that you've taken the time.

979
01:45:23,195 --> 01:45:24,496
[SPEAKER_07]: who's going to support the decision.

980
01:45:25,116 --> 01:45:28,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it's a simplification, obviously this is far more difficult.

981
01:45:29,137 --> 01:45:37,640
[SPEAKER_07]: To the speaker who said you're not giving parents enough, well the problem is that this is a pandemic and all I can say to parents is

982
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:41,762
[SPEAKER_07]: At any point, we need you to think about your backup plans.

983
01:45:42,443 --> 01:45:47,086
[SPEAKER_07]: I am sure many of you, all of you, are thinking about that on a day-to-day basis.

984
01:45:47,846 --> 01:46:01,535
[SPEAKER_07]: We are in a circumstance that calls upon families to be flexible and nimble in the most difficult ways, which obviously none of us would possibly choose.

985
01:46:02,595 --> 01:46:06,116
[SPEAKER_07]: So on saying all of that, I would support leaving the decision.

986
01:46:07,076 --> 01:46:19,599
[SPEAKER_07]: I always feel that as a school committee member, ultimately, as I vote on the superintendent's contract, that is my probably most important role in so many ways besides making policy.

987
01:46:20,659 --> 01:46:30,841
[SPEAKER_07]: And this superintendent, Dr. Marisa Edward-Vincent and her team have showed extraordinarily dedication and also have worked

988
01:46:31,582 --> 01:46:37,875
[SPEAKER_07]: very closely with the school committee to make sure that they are doing what we are asking of them.

989
01:46:40,240 --> 01:46:41,422
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Member van de Kloot.

990
01:46:42,264 --> 01:46:42,444
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

991
01:46:42,484 --> 01:46:42,745
[SPEAKER_11]: Willard?

992
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:59,988
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, I also am really glad to hear that the transmission and the numbers in general have been so low.

993
01:47:00,008 --> 01:47:09,316
[SPEAKER_12]: I was really worried about what would happen when kids started going back to school and so I'm glad that it has been low.

994
01:47:10,824 --> 01:47:14,826
[SPEAKER_12]: What I am really concerned about is going into the holidays.

995
01:47:16,146 --> 01:47:27,030
[SPEAKER_12]: I know, you know, I know a lot of families and staff are planning to travel this weekend and obviously, you know,

996
01:47:28,274 --> 01:47:36,477
[SPEAKER_12]: next month as well, but this happening this weekend, and then students returning on Monday.

997
01:47:36,497 --> 01:47:56,206
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just wondering what the administration and the nursing team, other than I know at my school, I teach at the Andrews Middle School, I know there were permission slips sent out for students to be tested when they came back in.

998
01:47:57,746 --> 01:47:59,607
[SPEAKER_12]: But that's not mandatory.

999
01:48:00,887 --> 01:48:11,711
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just, you know, I agree with what I've seen, what it sounds like people, you know, the data is showing that schools have been very safe places.

1000
01:48:12,411 --> 01:48:16,913
[SPEAKER_12]: However, we're now going into a situation where there are families who are

1001
01:48:17,705 --> 01:48:18,946
[SPEAKER_12]: go into different states.

1002
01:48:19,866 --> 01:48:28,629
[SPEAKER_12]: They're gathering in groups, family members that are getting risky, even small groups are risky at this point.

1003
01:48:28,709 --> 01:48:36,492
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just wanna make sure that this continues to be mitigated at school.

1004
01:48:36,532 --> 01:48:42,795
[SPEAKER_12]: So I wondered if there was a plan in terms of that with people traveling.

1005
01:48:50,282 --> 01:49:01,128
[SPEAKER_11]: The city and the school department has been messaging, asking people to keep Thanksgiving within your immediate family, and definitely less than 10 people.

1006
01:49:01,569 --> 01:49:02,910
[SPEAKER_11]: We're following state guidance.

1007
01:49:03,210 --> 01:49:04,751
[SPEAKER_11]: We're asking people not to travel.

1008
01:49:05,611 --> 01:49:10,674
[SPEAKER_11]: You're right, we do have the testing set up for teachers and staff every Wednesday.

1009
01:49:10,915 --> 01:49:16,238
[SPEAKER_11]: Yesterday, I think we had a record number of four to 500, and I'm sure that will be the same next week.

1010
01:49:16,358 --> 01:49:19,240
[SPEAKER_11]: And we want it to be because we wanna make sure people are getting tested

1011
01:49:19,732 --> 01:49:23,415
[SPEAKER_11]: to keep our schools, staff and children safe.

1012
01:49:24,015 --> 01:49:30,881
[SPEAKER_11]: As of December 1st, because we need to work through the logistics, we are gonna start testing the children once a week.

1013
01:49:31,782 --> 01:49:34,744
[SPEAKER_11]: It is not gonna be mandatory, but we are gonna strongly encourage it.

1014
01:49:35,224 --> 01:49:37,346
[SPEAKER_11]: It is not the invasive test.

1015
01:49:37,526 --> 01:49:40,208
[SPEAKER_11]: It's gonna be quick and easy and done within the school.

1016
01:49:40,328 --> 01:49:43,211
[SPEAKER_11]: So that is something more than other districts are doing.

1017
01:49:43,251 --> 01:49:45,993
[SPEAKER_11]: And we are hoping we need to

1018
01:49:46,265 --> 01:49:54,750
[SPEAKER_11]: finalize a number of details, but we are hoping to start pool testing sometime in January as an additional step that's going to cost a lot of money.

1019
01:49:54,830 --> 01:49:56,971
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're working on funding partners right now.

1020
01:49:57,292 --> 01:50:11,840
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot that needs to be worked out, but we are taking every step we can, testing-wise and obviously Board of Health and admin-wise, doing everything they can to keep everybody safe and healthy and to keep our children in school in the safest way possible.

1021
01:50:12,361 --> 01:50:14,482
[SPEAKER_11]: And to continue, I know we don't have

1022
01:50:15,013 --> 01:50:22,937
[SPEAKER_11]: specific date, but hopefully be coming out this week to start that Medford High School in-person hybrid model.

1023
01:50:23,237 --> 01:50:27,679
[SPEAKER_11]: I know there's a lot of questions as to dates, and hopefully that will be coming soon if we continue on this path.

1024
01:50:27,739 --> 01:50:40,125
[SPEAKER_11]: So just if people are listening tonight, please, for the safety of our children, our teachers, please do the right thing on Thanksgiving and the holidays during December.

1025
01:50:40,586 --> 01:50:45,769
[SPEAKER_11]: so that we can continue on this path of very little to no in-school transmission.

1026
01:50:45,789 --> 01:50:53,773
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if anybody has anything else to add, but Ms.

1027
01:50:53,913 --> 01:50:54,173
[SPEAKER_11]: Lied.

1028
01:50:54,193 --> 01:50:57,835
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, yes, thank you.

1029
01:50:58,975 --> 01:51:00,316
[SPEAKER_19]: Some of you may remember my name.

1030
01:51:00,436 --> 01:51:08,000
[SPEAKER_19]: I certainly emailed everyone on the school committee and the mayor about the testing facility and some of the administration.

1031
01:51:08,180 --> 01:51:10,341
[SPEAKER_19]: I've worked almost 10 years at the Broad Institute

1032
01:51:11,565 --> 01:51:13,006
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is very important to me.

1033
01:51:13,026 --> 01:51:18,490
[SPEAKER_19]: And I just wanted to say thank you when I saw the email that testing of students was going to be implemented.

1034
01:51:18,550 --> 01:51:20,191
[SPEAKER_19]: I was really, really happy.

1035
01:51:20,212 --> 01:51:22,173
[SPEAKER_19]: This is definitely the way forward.

1036
01:51:23,814 --> 01:51:26,296
[SPEAKER_19]: And this puts our community at an advantage over other communities.

1037
01:51:27,471 --> 01:51:32,716
[SPEAKER_19]: Wellesley and a few other towns, less than five of them, were part of a pilot program starting a few months ago.

1038
01:51:33,236 --> 01:51:38,541
[SPEAKER_19]: And I have a coworker at the Broad Institute who was a parent there and involved in the decision-making in that school district.

1039
01:51:39,562 --> 01:51:53,474
[SPEAKER_19]: The high school, I believe, is currently shut down because they had a few cases within community, within the school transmission, and they were successful in shutting it down and preventing an outbreak.

1040
01:51:54,673 --> 01:51:58,796
[SPEAKER_19]: I personally as a scientist, I believe that's the only way we can move forward is to have that.

1041
01:52:00,377 --> 01:52:07,443
[SPEAKER_19]: I also checked with them because I was concerned as the last speaker said that our testing wasn't going to be mandatory for students.

1042
01:52:07,623 --> 01:52:13,808
[SPEAKER_19]: And I understand that's an age thing under 18 and medical permissions.

1043
01:52:14,668 --> 01:52:16,490
[SPEAKER_19]: It is also not mandatory at Wellesley.

1044
01:52:16,530 --> 01:52:20,313
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just wanted to reassure any other parents like myself that

1045
01:52:20,991 --> 01:52:24,973
[SPEAKER_19]: program was successful in Wellesley in preventing an outbreak right before the holidays.

1046
01:52:25,773 --> 01:52:27,955
[SPEAKER_19]: So I believe it can be the same here.

1047
01:52:28,475 --> 01:52:33,377
[SPEAKER_19]: That being said, I do hope to see more encouragement of participation.

1048
01:52:33,717 --> 01:52:34,838
[SPEAKER_19]: It is very non-invasive.

1049
01:52:34,858 --> 01:52:37,419
[SPEAKER_19]: I take the test myself for work once every four days.

1050
01:52:37,479 --> 01:52:38,720
[SPEAKER_19]: It's very, very simple.

1051
01:52:39,328 --> 01:52:40,909
[SPEAKER_19]: It's definitely appropriate for children.

1052
01:52:40,929 --> 01:52:44,830
[SPEAKER_19]: And the other thing is the alpha med survey.

1053
01:52:44,850 --> 01:52:48,092
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know how well that's being enforced at the school.

1054
01:52:48,152 --> 01:52:54,114
[SPEAKER_19]: We certainly fill it out every day, but I wonder a couple of days I've been late filling it out after drop off.

1055
01:52:54,154 --> 01:52:56,455
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not sure how well that is being pursued.

1056
01:52:56,475 --> 01:53:01,937
[SPEAKER_19]: I think those participation in all of those things would add confidence to the parent community.

1057
01:53:03,594 --> 01:53:08,439
[SPEAKER_19]: And I just had a quick question since we're talking about metrics, maybe for the Board of Health.

1058
01:53:09,701 --> 01:53:22,034
[SPEAKER_19]: Now that the testing will be in place, I wonder what percent participation you think you'll have and will that change, will that factor in with the decisions that are made?

1059
01:53:22,134 --> 01:53:24,697
[SPEAKER_19]: Because it is possible and likely that

1060
01:53:25,059 --> 01:53:32,584
[SPEAKER_19]: with the increased testing in the school that the rate of in-community transmission will be lower than the rest of the Medford community?

1061
01:53:32,704 --> 01:53:42,231
[SPEAKER_19]: So is that gonna be taken into consideration into keeping the schools open if testing, if the number of cases within the schools is lower than it is within the general community?

1062
01:53:42,931 --> 01:53:43,192
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks.

1063
01:53:45,914 --> 01:53:50,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, I think all of that will be taken into consideration.

1064
01:53:51,457 --> 01:53:51,698
[SPEAKER_08]: You know,

1065
01:53:53,282 --> 01:53:55,223
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hoping we get great participation.

1066
01:53:56,703 --> 01:54:06,947
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is a huge advantage and something that I hope parents see as a huge advantage and allow their children to participate.

1067
01:54:06,967 --> 01:54:14,830
[SPEAKER_08]: Because this is, like you said, this is really going to help us as far as slowing the spread or catching outbreaks.

1068
01:54:15,991 --> 01:54:18,592
[SPEAKER_08]: But all the data, again, will have to be

1069
01:54:19,573 --> 01:54:24,157
[SPEAKER_08]: looked at aggregately and then separately, I guess, to see where we're going.

1070
01:54:28,201 --> 01:54:28,601
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1071
01:54:28,902 --> 01:54:39,671
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know that we did send out the forms to all parents, so we just want to encourage every parent that is interested in their children getting tested, and we strongly encourage it.

1072
01:54:39,771 --> 01:54:41,293
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be safe, and it's going to be done by

1073
01:54:42,045 --> 01:54:49,373
[SPEAKER_11]: professionals that you fill out that form so that we can start that process immediately on December 1st and make sure it's as effective as possible.

1074
01:54:50,314 --> 01:54:51,475
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to move the question.

1075
01:54:53,157 --> 01:54:54,999
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, Member McLaughlin, and then we're gonna move the question.

1076
01:54:55,719 --> 01:54:59,223
[SPEAKER_16]: Mayor, I'm sorry, there's five questions from the public as well in email.

1077
01:55:00,104 --> 01:55:00,925
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, Member McLaughlin.

1078
01:55:02,013 --> 01:55:17,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I was making a motion to move the question but I also had a question for the superintendent that I just wanted to, I wanted to first of all say thank you to the community members who came out tonight and encouraged the staff.

1079
01:55:17,662 --> 01:55:21,184
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's desperately needed right now so thank you very much for that.

1080
01:55:21,224 --> 01:55:21,744
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that was

1081
01:55:23,444 --> 01:55:25,485
[SPEAKER_09]: to see, good to see, and absolutely true.

1082
01:55:25,605 --> 01:55:43,031
[SPEAKER_09]: And I also wanted to ask the superintendent, I did get a question about sanitizer in the schools and whether the dispensers actually had alcohol hand sanitizer in them, or whether there was alcohol hand sanitizer elsewhere or what.

1083
01:55:43,091 --> 01:55:45,352
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was wondering, could you just address that for the community?

1084
01:55:51,204 --> 01:55:59,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's part of, I feel like it's related to the metrics, Mayor, because we're talking about school closures and if not, that's fine.

1085
01:55:59,031 --> 01:56:01,293
[SPEAKER_09]: I can move it to the next school committee meeting.

1086
01:56:01,373 --> 01:56:01,833
[SPEAKER_09]: It's up to you.

1087
01:56:04,936 --> 01:56:07,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Edwards-Vinson, if you could address that briefly.

1088
01:56:07,979 --> 01:56:10,721
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanna say that we do have sanitizer.

1089
01:56:10,941 --> 01:56:17,007
[SPEAKER_06]: The sanitizer, the lemon scented hand sanitizer is hospital grade approved.

1090
01:56:17,704 --> 01:56:19,505
[SPEAKER_06]: sanitization or sanitizer.

1091
01:56:19,585 --> 01:56:35,958
[SPEAKER_06]: But however, based on the most recent guidance of having hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol, we made an additional investment and purchased hand sanitizer jugs with pumps for all of the schools.

1092
01:56:36,258 --> 01:56:39,521
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was distributed to schools over the past two weeks.

1093
01:56:40,241 --> 01:56:43,984
[SPEAKER_06]: So if there is a staff person or someone saying that they don't have

1094
01:56:44,528 --> 01:56:48,651
[SPEAKER_06]: access to hand sanitizer with alcohol in it.

1095
01:56:49,352 --> 01:56:54,135
[SPEAKER_06]: They just need to speak to their school administrator because it was delivered to all of the buildings.

1096
01:56:55,176 --> 01:56:55,556
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1097
01:56:56,717 --> 01:56:58,898
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Dr. Vinson and Member McLaughlin.

1098
01:56:59,159 --> 01:57:03,622
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Russo, if you could please read the emails that have been submitted before we call the roll.

1099
01:57:04,622 --> 01:57:05,803
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure, thank you very much.

1100
01:57:08,725 --> 01:57:10,887
[SPEAKER_16]: This is an email from Megan Bayer,

1101
01:57:13,902 --> 01:57:18,563
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry, there's a long email here, sorry.

1102
01:57:18,943 --> 01:57:20,044
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, here we go.

1103
01:57:27,526 --> 01:57:30,287
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, there was a few responses that got mixed in, one second, okay.

1104
01:57:30,407 --> 01:57:35,108
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello, I am ready to provide my public comment for the November 24 school committee meeting.

1105
01:57:35,128 --> 01:57:37,629
[SPEAKER_16]: I may not be able to attend the meeting due to conflict.

1106
01:57:40,029 --> 01:57:42,390
[SPEAKER_16]: As you meet to take another look at the metrics,

1107
01:57:43,875 --> 01:57:54,041
[SPEAKER_16]: that are used to determine whether to continue the hybrid model and if and when to move to full remote, I continue to urge you to prioritize in-person school.

1108
01:57:54,822 --> 01:57:59,725
[SPEAKER_16]: At work today, I had the benefit of listening to public health experts from Harvard University and Boston University.

1109
01:57:59,765 --> 01:58:00,885
[SPEAKER_16]: Their message was clear.

1110
01:58:01,786 --> 01:58:06,389
[SPEAKER_16]: Even in light of the current COVID-19 cases in the state, students should be in school in person.

1111
01:58:06,849 --> 01:58:12,032
[SPEAKER_16]: These experts shared that more of the kids who are testing positive now are in full remote school.

1112
01:58:12,954 --> 01:58:16,778
[SPEAKER_16]: then are in school in person.

1113
01:58:16,918 --> 01:58:24,005
[SPEAKER_16]: They share that the science supports that with the safety measures our schools have in place, schools prevent transmission.

1114
01:58:24,545 --> 01:58:29,470
[SPEAKER_16]: Even without the access to these experts that I have, I was afforded through my job.

1115
01:58:29,831 --> 01:58:34,255
[SPEAKER_16]: One does not have to look far to see that this is an issue.

1116
01:58:34,821 --> 01:58:37,163
[SPEAKER_16]: that that is an opinion shared by public health experts.

1117
01:58:37,824 --> 01:58:46,911
[SPEAKER_16]: Many recent articles have included interviews with or opinions from public health experts and children's health experts who have shared the opinion that students should be in school in person.

1118
01:58:47,011 --> 01:58:54,858
[SPEAKER_16]: For example, in The Globe on November 12th, the chief of infectious disease at several local hospitals wrote in support of in-person school.

1119
01:58:55,518 --> 01:58:59,702
[SPEAKER_16]: These expert opinions are consistent with the latest guidance from the governor and from DESE.

1120
01:59:00,637 --> 01:59:20,297
[SPEAKER_16]: Accordingly, the metrics that Medford schools use to determine whether to have students in person or whether to switch all or any cohorts to full remote should take into account the expert opinions that students school should be school be in school in person, and it is spread

1121
01:59:21,956 --> 01:59:25,839
[SPEAKER_16]: within school, if any, that should drive decision-making rather than community spread.

1122
01:59:26,159 --> 01:59:38,650
[SPEAKER_16]: In addition to looking at the metrics that guide whether school is remote or in-person, it is important to have protocols for responding to any COVID-19 cases or suspected cases within a school, which I believe Medford Schools has in place.

1123
01:59:38,970 --> 01:59:41,932
[SPEAKER_16]: DESE released revised protocols today.

1124
01:59:42,413 --> 01:59:47,757
[SPEAKER_16]: DESE's protocols include protocols for potential school closure, partial or full, or district closure.

1125
01:59:49,359 --> 01:59:51,080
[SPEAKER_16]: DESE's protocols for school closures

1126
01:59:52,098 --> 01:59:55,942
[SPEAKER_16]: require that the school administration consult with a local board of health in making these decisions.

1127
01:59:56,002 --> 02:00:00,046
[SPEAKER_16]: In some situations, school administration shall consult DESE.

1128
02:00:00,746 --> 02:00:10,096
[SPEAKER_16]: Medford schools should look to DESE's protocols as a model for its protocols and its metrics that guide school decision-making.

1129
02:00:10,536 --> 02:00:16,602
[SPEAKER_16]: Additionally, DESE's instruction to school districts to consult local boards of health

1130
02:00:17,050 --> 02:00:21,273
[SPEAKER_16]: highlights the importance of relying on the experts in making these decisions.

1131
02:00:21,434 --> 02:00:33,383
[SPEAKER_16]: I encourage the school committee to rely on, to look to and rely on the city's director of Board of Health, the school department supervisor of school nurses and the school administration.

1132
02:00:33,844 --> 02:00:40,870
[SPEAKER_16]: The school committee is a body, hired superintendent Edward Vincent, and now the school committee must trust and reliance on superintendent Edward Vincent.

1133
02:00:41,550 --> 02:00:45,073
[SPEAKER_16]: On that note, I know that not everyone may agree on what the next step

1134
02:00:45,822 --> 02:00:55,404
[SPEAKER_16]: should be in light of the rising COVID-19 case numbers in the community, but I do know that everyone cares deeply about our students and wants what is best for the students.

1135
02:00:55,844 --> 02:01:04,245
[SPEAKER_16]: I commend the work of the school committee, the school administration, the administration, the city administration, the teachers, the school staff, and our community.

1136
02:01:04,545 --> 02:01:15,607
[SPEAKER_16]: Some communities around us still have not even gotten kids back in school in person at all, including high needs students, and Medford schools have grades K to eight in some tech programs back in the buildings.

1137
02:01:16,183 --> 02:01:23,127
[SPEAKER_16]: Medford teachers all started the school year remote, and then many had to adjust to their grades transitioning to hybrid.

1138
02:01:23,907 --> 02:01:30,571
[SPEAKER_16]: And that clearly required a lot of work to the teachers, but the teachers did it and continued to be there for their students.

1139
02:01:31,811 --> 02:01:39,115
[SPEAKER_16]: Medford schools have gone back and looked at the full remote cohort and looked at what changes can be made to make that option work better.

1140
02:01:39,496 --> 02:01:43,698
[SPEAKER_16]: Recently, I have heard fellow parents speak favorably about their kids full remote school.

1141
02:01:44,806 --> 02:01:55,052
[SPEAKER_16]: Medford schools have been offering testing to teachers since August and are going to be offering weekly surveillance testing to students, which seems like a very valuable tool to keep everyone safe.

1142
02:01:55,612 --> 02:02:10,201
[SPEAKER_16]: This late summer and into the fall, many communities around Medford had increases in the numbers that sent them into the red, but from mid-August until November, Medford's numbers stayed in the designated yellow range, despite fears of the school committee back in August.

1143
02:02:10,361 --> 02:02:11,942
[SPEAKER_16]: Medford community members have given

1144
02:02:12,838 --> 02:02:22,005
[SPEAKER_16]: of their time and resources to help Medford students by conducting school supply drives, making masks for students and teachers, and recently conducting food drives to help those in need.

1145
02:02:22,465 --> 02:02:33,614
[SPEAKER_16]: The community has done a lot for our children during a difficult time, and I hope that we can continue forward on this path and not have to take the step backwards of having the schools go full remote.

1146
02:02:34,234 --> 02:02:42,000
[SPEAKER_16]: That option would be a step backwards and would disadvantage many students, and at this time, based on expert opinions, is not a necessary step.

1147
02:02:44,138 --> 02:02:50,419
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, the next email is from Jim Donovan of Boston Avenue.

1148
02:02:50,980 --> 02:02:56,661
[SPEAKER_16]: School committee members, I know that the subject of tonight's meeting is the matrix the MPS will work under going forward.

1149
02:02:57,201 --> 02:03:11,124
[SPEAKER_16]: I implore upon the school committee to make in-person learning its number one priority and adopt a matrix that allows the MPS administration the flexibility to decide on school closures.

1150
02:03:11,665 --> 02:03:24,876
[SPEAKER_16]: As Governor Baker has said on numerous occasions, the only data on spread in schools is that schools are not COVID spreading events, that children are actually safer in a monitored school environment, and in-person learning should be our main priority.

1151
02:03:25,857 --> 02:03:29,380
[SPEAKER_16]: To my knowledge, we have not quarantined any cohorts in the MPS.

1152
02:03:29,680 --> 02:03:35,765
[SPEAKER_16]: The only recent incident I'm aware of is four teachers quarantined after having lunch together in the staff lunchroom.

1153
02:03:36,245 --> 02:03:39,408
[SPEAKER_16]: This information was provided by the Mass Teachers Association website.

1154
02:03:40,245 --> 02:03:46,328
[SPEAKER_16]: we should prioritize our successes and continue to move forward, move towards getting all our children in schools.

1155
02:03:46,588 --> 02:03:55,752
[SPEAKER_16]: Please keep in mind the success our surrounding private schools have had with full attendance with arguably inferior school structures and ventilation.

1156
02:03:59,413 --> 02:04:08,097
[SPEAKER_16]: Next one is from Leticia Rocha of Mystic Valley Parkway.

1157
02:04:09,305 --> 02:04:13,226
[SPEAKER_16]: Will the positivity rate without cuffs be utilized for decision-making?

1158
02:04:13,787 --> 02:04:17,488
[SPEAKER_16]: You also used data that was not from the last two weeks.

1159
02:04:17,568 --> 02:04:22,009
[SPEAKER_16]: Therefore, the 1.11 positivity rate is not reflective of the current situation.

1160
02:04:22,610 --> 02:04:25,931
[SPEAKER_16]: This should continue to be publicly updated as part of your dashboard.

1161
02:04:26,731 --> 02:04:30,432
[SPEAKER_16]: It was announced that all MPS students will have access to COVID-19 testing.

1162
02:04:31,052 --> 02:04:36,014
[SPEAKER_16]: Is this for any student or only students that have entered the school buildings and exhibit COVID symptoms?

1163
02:04:36,194 --> 02:04:38,655
[SPEAKER_16]: How will asymptomatic transmission be addressed?

1164
02:04:39,734 --> 02:04:45,476
[SPEAKER_16]: And administrators have not made clear what is meant when they state that there is no school transmission.

1165
02:04:46,276 --> 02:04:47,817
[SPEAKER_16]: How is school transmission defined?

1166
02:04:47,837 --> 02:04:51,838
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if anybody wants to answer any of those from Leticia.

1167
02:04:55,379 --> 02:04:55,880
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Murphy.

1168
02:04:57,740 --> 02:05:03,942
[SPEAKER_14]: With regard to the testing, and I think we can't stress enough the importance of getting the consent forms.

1169
02:05:04,163 --> 02:05:08,284
[SPEAKER_14]: And so all families of cohorts A, B, and C have received the consent forms.

1170
02:05:08,852 --> 02:05:15,738
[SPEAKER_14]: They are, they were, I think they were technically due today, but all that means is we're, we'll stop calling and emailing to try to get them back after today.

1171
02:05:16,498 --> 02:05:22,724
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, we want to get, we want to get those consent forms in, if there are parents, families out there, come back to the school on Monday.

1172
02:05:22,744 --> 02:05:26,107
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're cohort A or B, please bring your consent form in.

1173
02:05:26,947 --> 02:05:30,310
[SPEAKER_14]: The testing is for all students who receive in-person instruction.

1174
02:05:30,690 --> 02:05:35,855
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's cohorts A, B, and C. It has nothing to do with symptoms or

1175
02:05:36,682 --> 02:05:37,683
[SPEAKER_14]: or anything along those lines.

1176
02:05:37,703 --> 02:05:41,266
[SPEAKER_14]: There is a separate testing pilot that Ms.

1177
02:05:41,306 --> 02:06:04,844
[SPEAKER_14]: Rae will be able to speak about at a future meeting that will be a rapid testing program that we'll be engaged in, which is completely separate from the surveillance testing that starts at the McGlynn on Monday, and then generally after that will be Tuesdays and Fridays going forward for cohorts A, B, and C. So it's all students who receive in-person, not included are students in cohort D

1178
02:06:06,436 --> 02:06:11,939
[SPEAKER_14]: Students that are fully remote will not have access to this program.

1179
02:06:12,359 --> 02:06:20,004
[SPEAKER_14]: The rationale for that is it is a public health initiative for purposes of keeping transmission out of school communities.

1180
02:06:20,064 --> 02:06:24,946
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you're not attending school in person, then you're neither at risk nor represent a risk.

1181
02:06:28,308 --> 02:06:28,628
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1182
02:06:28,848 --> 02:06:31,009
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there any other emails or gonna move the question?

1183
02:06:31,670 --> 02:06:31,990
[SPEAKER_16]: Two more.

1184
02:06:33,507 --> 02:06:39,089
[SPEAKER_16]: This one is from, thank you, this is from Mike Burgholzer of Lewis Street.

1185
02:06:42,270 --> 02:06:43,951
[SPEAKER_16]: Could you touch on the Tufts data again?

1186
02:06:44,051 --> 02:06:49,713
[SPEAKER_16]: According to the Tufts website, the Medford-Somerville campus tested 7,196 times last week.

1187
02:06:50,333 --> 02:06:55,295
[SPEAKER_16]: If we were to double that to represent two weeks of testing, we are around 14,000.

1188
02:06:55,335 --> 02:06:58,476
[SPEAKER_16]: Do 2,500 of those 14,000-ish really only live in Medford?

1189
02:07:02,326 --> 02:07:13,451
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, according to the state, Medford had 16,428 tests the last 14 days, while Malden has only tested 7,994 times.

1190
02:07:14,172 --> 02:07:19,314
[SPEAKER_16]: I hope we are testing twice as much as neighboring communities, but that seems like an outlier statistically.

1191
02:07:23,268 --> 02:07:26,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I do not have the current data.

1192
02:07:26,209 --> 02:07:29,951
[SPEAKER_06]: The data that we presented in the slide deck, we had requested from Tufts.

1193
02:07:30,492 --> 02:07:37,295
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was the previous week's data based on the number of tests that they conducted at that point in time.

1194
02:07:37,915 --> 02:07:39,156
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's what we had used.

1195
02:07:39,216 --> 02:07:50,942
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't wanna give misinformation, but what's in the slide, we have that specific timeframe noted based on the other tests that were taking place in Medford.

1196
02:07:51,422 --> 02:08:01,408
[SPEAKER_06]: So there were an additional approximate 13,000 tests that were administered in Medford that were not part of Tufts University, but I don't have this week's data.

1197
02:08:04,270 --> 02:08:04,750
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1198
02:08:04,770 --> 02:08:05,931
[SPEAKER_11]: Any other questions?

1199
02:08:06,691 --> 02:08:09,753
[SPEAKER_16]: There's one more, but it looks like Allison wants to actually respond.

1200
02:08:09,773 --> 02:08:10,473
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

1201
02:08:11,274 --> 02:08:11,994
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

1202
02:08:12,715 --> 02:08:14,756
[SPEAKER_11]: Allison, yes, briefly, please.

1203
02:08:16,522 --> 02:08:17,682
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, I'm so sorry.

1204
02:08:18,002 --> 02:08:24,464
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to comment after Mr. Murphy said something there, clarifying some wording that he used, I think unintentionally.

1205
02:08:24,504 --> 02:08:30,126
[SPEAKER_19]: He mentioned that the school testing for children was a rapid testing program.

1206
02:08:30,526 --> 02:08:38,548
[SPEAKER_19]: And I've noticed that there's been some confusion among other parents that there's something known as a rapid test, which can be done in a doctor's office for 15 minutes.

1207
02:08:38,608 --> 02:08:40,028
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's a very unreliable test.

1208
02:08:40,529 --> 02:08:45,890
[SPEAKER_19]: And this testing that has been proposed in this program for students in the schools

1209
02:08:46,744 --> 02:08:52,846
[SPEAKER_19]: is only rapid because the results come back quickly, but it's actually the very accurate PCR-based test, as far as I know.

1210
02:08:53,086 --> 02:08:54,627
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to clarify that.

1211
02:08:54,647 --> 02:08:56,187
[SPEAKER_19]: I know there's some misunderstanding about that.

1212
02:08:56,828 --> 02:08:57,148
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1213
02:08:57,248 --> 02:08:58,708
[SPEAKER_19]: We appreciate the clarification.

1214
02:08:59,589 --> 02:08:59,929
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1215
02:09:00,389 --> 02:09:01,389
[SPEAKER_16]: And I have one more question.

1216
02:09:02,029 --> 02:09:02,930
[SPEAKER_16]: One more email, excuse me.

1217
02:09:03,070 --> 02:09:05,251
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me just hope that's true.

1218
02:09:05,411 --> 02:09:05,591
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1219
02:09:06,211 --> 02:09:09,012
[SPEAKER_16]: This is from Gary Klein of Sagamore Avenue.

1220
02:09:10,252 --> 02:09:13,574
[SPEAKER_16]: I wanna thank the mayor, the members of the committee and the administration for all your hard work.

1221
02:09:13,934 --> 02:09:21,018
[SPEAKER_16]: I also particularly appreciate the teachers who are working so hard under the difficult circumstances to teach children effectively and creatively.

1222
02:09:21,038 --> 02:09:23,780
[SPEAKER_16]: I have the following questions and comment questions.

1223
02:09:24,400 --> 02:09:27,422
[SPEAKER_16]: Has there been testing of students who are attending school in person?

1224
02:09:28,123 --> 02:09:30,544
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a plan for such testing?

1225
02:09:30,924 --> 02:09:35,547
[SPEAKER_16]: Isn't it possible that a lot more than nine students have had COVID in the schools?

1226
02:09:36,772 --> 02:09:44,280
[SPEAKER_16]: Absent a meaningful testing program, do we really have evidence of any kind whether the virus is spreading in the school?

1227
02:09:44,300 --> 02:09:50,326
[SPEAKER_16]: And I can read his comment first, unless somebody wants to answer that.

1228
02:09:51,407 --> 02:09:54,751
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we've answered that question a couple minutes ago.

1229
02:09:54,771 --> 02:09:55,692
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1230
02:09:56,298 --> 02:10:13,793
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, and then the comment is, in light of exponentially increasing numbers of cases in Medford this month and the expectation that the numbers will continue to increase, it's fair to extrapolate a situation where schools will need to close, either by an order from the governor or because the school system itself decides to close.

1231
02:10:14,453 --> 02:10:22,060
[SPEAKER_16]: We need a plan that anticipates that eventuality so that parents get enough notice to arrange for childcare

1232
02:10:22,592 --> 02:10:25,795
[SPEAKER_16]: and to plan for managing their children's remote learning experience.

1233
02:10:26,075 --> 02:10:34,722
[SPEAKER_16]: If schools close, we don't want to have a situation like Boston or New York City in which parents get little or no prior notice.

1234
02:10:35,443 --> 02:10:43,050
[SPEAKER_16]: We also need a plan that does more than we did in March to transition kids, including kids with special needs, to the best possible remote learning plan.

1235
02:10:44,448 --> 02:10:45,909
[SPEAKER_16]: Are those plans in process?

1236
02:10:46,149 --> 02:10:51,413
[SPEAKER_16]: I understand the importance of in-person learning, especially for students who are already present in the schools.

1237
02:10:51,834 --> 02:10:59,340
[SPEAKER_16]: Does it really make sense over the next few weeks of surge to continue to bring more kids back into the schools?

1238
02:10:59,440 --> 02:11:01,381
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for considering my views.

1239
02:11:03,263 --> 02:11:03,603
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1240
02:11:03,803 --> 02:11:05,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1241
02:11:07,966 --> 02:11:11,009
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Van de Kloot, if you could call the roll.

1242
02:11:14,449 --> 02:11:16,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Just can somebody reread the motion?

1243
02:11:16,450 --> 02:11:19,172
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think there is another community member with a hand up.

1244
02:11:21,974 --> 02:11:36,582
[SPEAKER_09]: And just for information, the motion is will include the recommendation of memogram and the discussion around the Dave Murphy, the discussion around the identification of various schools.

1245
02:11:38,103 --> 02:11:40,125
[SPEAKER_09]: As the as the second addendum, right?

1246
02:11:40,725 --> 02:11:44,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Disaggregated data was the first addendum and then the second addendum

1247
02:11:44,678 --> 02:11:46,058
[SPEAKER_09]: If I'm not mistaken, am I mistaken?

1248
02:11:46,078 --> 02:11:48,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham, did you ask for that to be an addendum to this motion?

1249
02:11:49,939 --> 02:11:50,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1250
02:11:51,600 --> 02:11:51,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1251
02:11:52,220 --> 02:11:56,961
[SPEAKER_17]: And that would be the broad statement with the name of the building?

1252
02:11:58,222 --> 02:11:58,562
[SPEAKER_17]: Correct.

1253
02:12:00,342 --> 02:12:04,444
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you want me to read the motion again, or do you want to take the hands raised?

1254
02:12:06,064 --> 02:12:07,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to do the amendment first?

1255
02:12:09,465 --> 02:12:09,965
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, let me.

1256
02:12:10,045 --> 02:12:10,205
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

1257
02:12:10,225 --> 02:12:12,386
[SPEAKER_11]: The hand's been lowered.

1258
02:12:14,452 --> 02:12:17,153
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, you can take the amendments first by roll call, please.

1259
02:12:18,114 --> 02:12:19,034
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

1260
02:12:20,255 --> 02:12:22,956
[SPEAKER_07]: On the amendment, can we just lump them together?

1261
02:12:23,677 --> 02:12:23,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Please.

1262
02:12:24,377 --> 02:12:24,677
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

1263
02:12:26,038 --> 02:12:27,839
[SPEAKER_07]: On the amendments, member Graham?

1264
02:12:29,559 --> 02:12:29,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1265
02:12:30,220 --> 02:12:30,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Kretz?

1266
02:12:31,520 --> 02:12:31,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1267
02:12:32,321 --> 02:12:32,901
[SPEAKER_07]: McLaughlin?

1268
02:12:33,441 --> 02:12:33,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1269
02:12:34,502 --> 02:12:34,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

1270
02:12:34,642 --> 02:12:34,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Stone?

1271
02:12:35,362 --> 02:12:35,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1272
02:12:36,303 --> 02:12:36,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Rousseau?

1273
02:12:40,545 --> 02:12:40,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Hall?

1274
02:12:42,426 --> 02:12:42,926
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, sorry.

1275
02:12:44,197 --> 02:12:45,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Vanderclute, yes.

1276
02:12:45,758 --> 02:12:46,578
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor Lungo-Kern.

1277
02:12:47,478 --> 02:12:49,419
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1278
02:12:49,599 --> 02:12:50,399
[SPEAKER_11]: Paper passes.

1279
02:12:50,579 --> 02:12:51,319
[SPEAKER_11]: Amendments pass.

1280
02:12:52,280 --> 02:12:53,480
[SPEAKER_11]: And then a roll call.

1281
02:12:53,840 --> 02:12:58,882
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if we're gonna take a roll call on giving our superintendent, obviously with the help of Ms.

1282
02:12:58,942 --> 02:12:59,642
[SPEAKER_11]: Ray and Ms.

1283
02:12:59,702 --> 02:13:07,905
[SPEAKER_11]: O'Connor, the authority to continue contact tracing and making decision-making on our schools.

1284
02:13:08,725 --> 02:13:11,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Kathy, what was the original motion?

1285
02:13:12,493 --> 02:13:29,650
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, so the original motion was a motion to accept the superintendent's recommendations continue to utilize parts one building classroom readiness and three district in school specific metrics from the original member public schools COVID-19 reopening dashboard update.

1286
02:13:30,758 --> 02:13:45,287
[SPEAKER_17]: reopening dashboard, update part two, Medford community health metrics of the original Medford public schools COVID-19 reopening dashboard to include department public health updated color coded classification system.

1287
02:13:45,307 --> 02:13:55,793
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was amended as noted per Melanie McLaughlin to include the disaggregated data of the students who were actually in-person or remote regardless of assigned cohort.

1288
02:13:56,594 --> 02:13:59,036
[SPEAKER_17]: and to include the amendment from Ms.

1289
02:13:59,076 --> 02:14:09,886
[SPEAKER_17]: Graham, adding an asterisk to note the name of the building affected in the color-coded chart, I believe.

1290
02:14:10,106 --> 02:14:10,827
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that right, Ms.

1291
02:14:10,847 --> 02:14:12,308
[SPEAKER_17]: Graham, in the color-coded chart?

1292
02:14:12,428 --> 02:14:15,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we just voted on that.

1293
02:14:15,051 --> 02:14:18,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the two amendments were already voted on, so we're good there.

1294
02:14:19,174 --> 02:14:20,956
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's just Kathy's motion.

1295
02:14:21,360 --> 02:14:27,164
[SPEAKER_11]: The main motion as amended to give the superintendent and her team authority ever.

1296
02:14:27,464 --> 02:14:29,386
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, most motion to sever.

1297
02:14:29,826 --> 02:14:39,533
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll take the amendment first, giving the administration and the health team authority to have decision making.

1298
02:14:40,314 --> 02:14:41,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Continued authority.

1299
02:14:41,615 --> 02:14:41,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1300
02:14:43,922 --> 02:14:45,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, just a point of information.

1301
02:14:45,483 --> 02:14:46,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information.

1302
02:14:47,084 --> 02:14:48,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't we already vote on that?

1303
02:14:48,445 --> 02:14:49,666
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we need to vote on it again?

1304
02:14:49,966 --> 02:15:01,793
[SPEAKER_11]: If we already... We voted to give them decision-making on... Member Grimm stated, it was clarified, it was to give them decision-making on the staggered hybrid.

1305
02:15:02,194 --> 02:15:13,721
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think we should make it clear to give them decision-making on school closing and contact tracing ability.

1306
02:15:14,948 --> 02:15:15,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, member Graham.

1307
02:15:16,569 --> 02:15:17,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Which motion are we voting on?

1308
02:15:18,329 --> 02:15:19,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we voting on Kathy's motion?

1309
02:15:20,370 --> 02:15:21,831
[SPEAKER_11]: We're voting on the amendment first.

1310
02:15:22,351 --> 02:15:22,831
[SPEAKER_05]: The amendment.

1311
02:15:23,291 --> 02:15:25,172
[SPEAKER_05]: And okay, can somebody reread the amendment?

1312
02:15:28,133 --> 02:15:38,038
[SPEAKER_11]: To give the superintendent and the health team authority for decision making when it comes to school classroom or school closures.

1313
02:15:41,619 --> 02:15:43,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Based on section

1314
02:15:44,033 --> 02:15:49,177
[SPEAKER_05]: two community health metrics or section three school specific conditions?

1315
02:15:54,180 --> 02:16:02,166
[SPEAKER_11]: Based on collective information that they have before them, because every situation will be different given the different variables?

1316
02:16:06,669 --> 02:16:13,254
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason that I ask is because I don't think anybody is posing questions about section three.

1317
02:16:16,309 --> 02:16:21,594
[SPEAKER_05]: The superintendent is doing that today and I haven't heard anybody suggest that she should not continue to do that.

1318
02:16:21,614 --> 02:16:30,442
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the clarifications that we are talking about are solely around the community health metrics driving a closure.

1319
02:16:30,462 --> 02:16:38,128
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still giving authority to the superintendent.

1320
02:16:38,829 --> 02:16:41,952
[SPEAKER_07]: But authority for what I think is what I'm trying to be clear about.

1321
02:16:42,570 --> 02:16:46,814
[SPEAKER_07]: to determine whether the schools need to close or should remain open.

1322
02:16:47,295 --> 02:16:49,717
[SPEAKER_11]: Classroom, school, or district needs to close.

1323
02:16:51,940 --> 02:16:53,061
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to be clear on that.

1324
02:16:53,101 --> 02:16:54,562
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that was in question.

1325
02:16:54,943 --> 02:17:00,188
[SPEAKER_11]: So if there's a motion on the floor and it's seconded, I think we need to take a roll call on that.

1326
02:17:01,183 --> 02:17:01,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Jenny Graham?

1327
02:17:02,784 --> 02:17:03,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's second?

1328
02:17:03,905 --> 02:17:09,088
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still not, I guess I'm just not clear on what we're saying.

1329
02:17:09,148 --> 02:17:27,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if we're saying classroom, if we're saying school based on section three, which are school specific conditions, but if we're saying based on our like red, yellow, green, our positivity rate, et cetera, to me, those are two different questions.

1330
02:17:28,548 --> 02:17:38,998
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's all encompassing, classroom, school, district, based on our metrics, based on the decision-making by our board of health and giving the superintendent the authority.

1331
02:17:42,741 --> 02:17:45,124
[SPEAKER_07]: We're affirming the superintendent's authority too.

1332
02:17:45,224 --> 02:17:49,888
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure what we're voting on either.

1333
02:17:55,068 --> 02:17:56,729
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, somebody has to write it into the minutes.

1334
02:17:56,789 --> 02:17:59,329
[SPEAKER_16]: Does the person who has to write it into the minutes know what they're writing?

1335
02:17:59,890 --> 02:18:00,070
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

1336
02:18:00,110 --> 02:18:01,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Wise, are you on the call?

1337
02:18:01,170 --> 02:18:03,031
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I've stated it a few times.

1338
02:18:03,091 --> 02:18:04,991
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanna see what you have written down.

1339
02:18:13,154 --> 02:18:14,274
[SPEAKER_16]: She may not be able to unmute.

1340
02:18:14,815 --> 02:18:18,196
[SPEAKER_14]: Mary, it may just be- She's got it now.

1341
02:18:18,256 --> 02:18:21,797
[SPEAKER_14]: It's recognizing the continued authority to make decisions about closures, correct?

1342
02:18:22,652 --> 02:18:22,932
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1343
02:18:23,613 --> 02:18:26,375
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we have clarity on that.

1344
02:18:27,876 --> 02:18:31,419
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, but the two committee members need more clarity.

1345
02:18:31,920 --> 02:18:32,180
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

1346
02:18:33,501 --> 02:18:38,925
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that separating section two with section three makes any sense.

1347
02:18:39,045 --> 02:18:42,728
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that it's the whole thing.

1348
02:18:45,411 --> 02:18:49,114
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't understand my colleagues'

1349
02:18:50,463 --> 02:18:51,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, lack of clarity on this.

1350
02:18:51,884 --> 02:18:57,989
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, to me, um, we're saying, yes, the superintendent is the one who's going to make the final call.

1351
02:18:58,269 --> 02:19:04,513
[SPEAKER_07]: We're, we're saying the superintendent, the school committee is not going to be called into session to make, to make, to take the vote.

1352
02:19:07,155 --> 02:19:18,063
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the nuance is that that's true today for pro classroom program level closures.

1353
02:19:19,164 --> 02:19:19,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

1354
02:19:20,033 --> 02:19:37,944
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't personally have any issue with that, but I do think that this committee should convene if we are going to make decisions based on our community health metrics at the very minimum to take public comment before we make such a decision.

1355
02:19:38,264 --> 02:19:43,647
[SPEAKER_05]: So to me, I don't want to say, I do not want to vote no to a blanket.

1356
02:19:43,927 --> 02:19:47,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Does Dr. Edward Vincent have authority, yes or no?

1357
02:19:48,400 --> 02:20:08,734
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not want to have to do that, but I am uncomfortable that we could foresee a situation where we go red, we are red for four, five, six weeks, and no formal discussion of this committee is had.

1358
02:20:10,325 --> 02:20:10,925
[SPEAKER_05]: To weigh those decisions.

1359
02:20:10,965 --> 02:20:12,486
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just an unreal place.

1360
02:20:12,666 --> 02:20:14,526
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we have meetings every two weeks.

1361
02:20:15,366 --> 02:20:15,767
[SPEAKER_11]: At least.

1362
02:20:17,047 --> 02:20:20,748
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like this committee is just going to abdicate and walk off.

1363
02:20:20,888 --> 02:20:22,388
[SPEAKER_07]: We have continued meetings.

1364
02:20:23,829 --> 02:20:25,909
[SPEAKER_07]: We're talking about this at every meeting.

1365
02:20:29,430 --> 02:20:36,192
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that you're trying to define something so specifically is kind of losing the forest for the trees.

1366
02:20:37,092 --> 02:20:37,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's your opinion.

1367
02:20:37,932 --> 02:20:38,932
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fine.

1368
02:20:39,633 --> 02:20:40,353
[SPEAKER_05]: That's your opinion.

1369
02:20:40,373 --> 02:20:57,597
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's very different when we are talking about things happening inside a school building versus what we are talking about when we are making decisions about the impacts on our schools of metrics that are reflective of the community around us.

1370
02:20:58,397 --> 02:20:59,898
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to close schools.

1371
02:21:00,078 --> 02:21:03,160
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want anyone to think that I want to close schools.

1372
02:21:04,040 --> 02:21:12,826
[SPEAKER_05]: What I do want is if we are faced with a real possibility of that, I want to have a conversation about it and a collaboration.

1373
02:21:12,846 --> 02:21:15,147
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like part of the reason why we have

1374
02:21:15,847 --> 02:21:20,010
[SPEAKER_05]: been so successful is because we started out in a collaborative fashion.

1375
02:21:20,030 --> 02:21:33,001
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not feel comfortable putting this all on Dr. Edward Vincent's shoulders because as soon as something goes sideways, everyone will be caught in the community will not be praising her anymore.

1376
02:21:33,021 --> 02:21:34,362
[SPEAKER_05]: They will be calling for her head.

1377
02:21:34,462 --> 02:21:40,367
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is unfair of us as a committee to put all of that on her personally.

1378
02:21:40,947 --> 02:21:47,809
[SPEAKER_05]: when all I am asking is that before such a decision is made, we have a collaborative conversation about it.

1379
02:21:48,070 --> 02:21:49,170
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I'm asking.

1380
02:21:49,190 --> 02:21:51,351
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that is unreasonable.

1381
02:21:52,891 --> 02:21:55,932
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's a motion on the floor, so we can call the roll.

1382
02:21:55,952 --> 02:21:58,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1383
02:21:58,893 --> 02:21:59,493

[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, five in the positive, two in the negative.

1399
02:22:25,435 --> 02:22:26,736
[SPEAKER_11]: Amendment passes.

1400
02:22:27,016 --> 02:22:29,477
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we have member Kretz's main motion.

1401
02:22:30,037 --> 02:22:30,857
