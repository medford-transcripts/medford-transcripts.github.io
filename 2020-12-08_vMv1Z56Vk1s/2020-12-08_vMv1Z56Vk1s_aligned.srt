Yes.

75
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:07,681
Mayor Lungo Kern.

76
00:04:08,001 --> 00:04:08,221
Yes.

77
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:09,742
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

78
00:04:09,802 --> 00:04:10,602
Paper passes.

79
00:04:12,062 --> 00:04:13,723
Number four, report of secretary.

80
00:04:15,023 --> 00:04:15,484
There is none.

81
00:04:18,004 --> 00:04:19,485
Number five, report of committees.

82
00:04:20,044 --> 00:04:27,776
First up, we have Communications Strategy and Stakeholder Engagement Subcommittee member Jenny Graham.

83
00:04:27,996 --> 00:04:29,699
Approval of minutes from 11-10-2020 and 12-1-2020 meetings.

84
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,339
Member Graham.

85
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:30,600
Thanks.

86
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:56,926
So on November 10th, the Communications Engagement and Strategic Planning Subcommittee met from 530 to 630, and we specifically discussed the practices around kindergarten orientation, both current and possible, I guess I'll say.

87
00:04:56,946 --> 00:05:04,712
And during that meeting, we talked a little bit about sort of our current process, and this has been added to the minutes

88
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:11,671
And Susie did update everyone's folders, sorry, earlier today.

89
00:05:13,953 --> 00:05:32,143
The current process that we have operated under for a long time starts with registration in March, and then presentations called Bridges to Kindergarten in March and April, a visiting day in May, and then kindergarten screenings in September.

90
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:50,387
We looked at that and we actually took a look at practices in our neighboring districts because, as you remember, this came up because we back in February hadn't started our orientation yet per the typical schedule.

91
00:05:51,168 --> 00:05:56,791
And in particular, the charter schools were already asking people to make decisions about enrollment.

92
00:05:57,877 --> 00:06:11,361
Um, so we spent this meeting sort of deep diving on, um, what various, um, communities around us and, um, including the charter schools are doing, um, based on information that was publicly available.

93
00:06:11,381 --> 00:06:21,364
Um, and in general, most, I'll say most are many communities and certainly, um, the charter schools who, um, take students from Medford.

94
00:06:23,332 --> 00:06:26,475
all get their process going quite early in the year.

95
00:06:26,995 --> 00:06:28,436
Some of them really early.

96
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:33,361
One of the charter schools first lottery is on January 4th.

97
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:41,067
So they are moving and grooving long before we have historically started our process.

98
00:06:41,828 --> 00:06:43,129
So we talked a little bit about that.

99
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:43,870
We talked about

100
00:06:45,549 --> 00:06:48,151
some of the options that we might have.

101
00:06:48,591 --> 00:07:04,264
And we heard from some folks in the community around certainly like what a weird year this past year was, but also the sort of necessity that came out of it being that we now have online registration, which we have never had before.

102
00:07:05,205 --> 00:07:07,947
And that gives us sort of a unique opportunity to do something different.

103
00:07:09,288 --> 00:07:12,330
We did talk about ways to promote

104
00:07:13,331 --> 00:07:30,827
what we do in kindergarten, whether it's because of COVID and limiting, you know, the ability to gather people in person or just in general to be able to provide a deeper, richer content and collateral like out on the website and in the community so that when people are

105
00:07:31,387 --> 00:07:43,795
starting to sort of do their research and think about what is it that Medford public schools can offer that there's sort of answers to those common questions and we had a couple of community members join us and they spoke specifically about.

106
00:07:44,735 --> 00:07:52,320
Some of the things that that they saw and that they were interested in learning more about when they were in the early stages of the process.

107
00:07:53,971 --> 00:07:58,416
We also talked about how how we reach families.

108
00:07:58,516 --> 00:08:02,600
So we typically or historically have waited for families to come to us.

109
00:08:03,241 --> 00:08:11,651
And one of the things we talked about in the meeting and agreed on is that we would actually work with City Hall to do some outbound

110
00:08:12,271 --> 00:08:38,938
communication to families who have eligible students to make sure that they know about Medford Public Schools, that they know that we are excited to have their students join us, and really to start that communication process with outreach and outbound over and above sort of our typical tactics of reaching people through local preschools or through the Medford Family Network, which we would continue to want to do.

111
00:08:39,995 --> 00:08:56,628
Um, we did also talk about, um, sort of understanding the process and, um, feedback from the community as we, um, as we go through, as we go through this, um, this change.

112
00:08:57,289 --> 00:09:07,537
And I'll say sort of in summary, what we, what we landed on was, um, some revisions to our timeline, um, that we would start with our family mailing.

113
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:18,991
And as well as with trying to create some sort of video that starts to socialize kindergarten for families in the month of December, so that's this month.

114
00:09:20,312 --> 00:09:28,819
And just to really outline the registration process, what to expect and how people can learn more about MPS without having to

115
00:09:31,184 --> 00:09:35,688
only gather their information from social media, friends, et cetera.

116
00:09:35,768 --> 00:09:46,236
So really making sure that we're trying to reach folks in an official capacity as well as through what is invaluable in terms of personal experience.

117
00:09:47,957 --> 00:10:00,107
We talked about also focusing in the month of December on outreaching to community resources like the MFN, as well as some of the local preschools to let them know that our registration timelines are changing.

118
00:10:01,154 --> 00:10:05,831
And then we talked about, you know, December and January doing

119
00:10:06,911 --> 00:10:09,472
some virtual cross school tours.

120
00:10:10,132 --> 00:10:30,776
And there were, we talked a lot about the videos that were pretty well received in the community this past spring because of COVID, but really saying, how can we create some video in the December, January timeframe that gives people an understanding of what our schools are all about and provides people access, you know, certainly this year, knowing that access will be somewhat limited.

121
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:48,636
We also talked about tour nights being like TBD for this year, just because of COVID, at least for the time being, but that we put it sort of on the post-pandemic wishlist of things that we would want to do so that we have

122
00:10:49,397 --> 00:11:04,468
sort of a structured forum in a way for people to engage who want that and that we can move past the feedback that we've gotten from the community in the past where people are reaching out to ask for tours and aren't getting responses.

123
00:11:04,728 --> 00:11:17,698
And some of that could just be not sort of funneling those things to those requests to a consolidated place is ripe for error and for those things sort of getting dropped.

124
00:11:19,526 --> 00:11:23,608
We also talked about that we will open registration starting in January.

125
00:11:23,628 --> 00:11:26,129
So that's a big shift for us from what we have done in the past.

126
00:11:26,189 --> 00:11:28,150
And it will of course be online, which is amazing.

127
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:46,117
That we would start Bridges to Kindergarten presentations in February and still plan sort of typical kindergarten visiting day in May, as we have always done, COVID dependent, and then continue with our kindergarten screenings in September for now.

128
00:11:46,692 --> 00:12:04,637
but really to try to change the timeline of the early parts of the registration process so that we are intentionally outbounding information to prospective families and we're giving them some vehicles to learn about us, whether COVID or not.

129
00:12:05,477 --> 00:12:08,478
And we are encouraging that registration process to get going.

130
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:14,540
So that was our meeting on November the 10th.

131
00:12:16,729 --> 00:12:17,529
Motion to approve.

132
00:12:19,931 --> 00:12:20,691
Motion to approve.

133
00:12:21,832 --> 00:12:25,634
Motion to approve by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Van de Kloot.

134
00:12:26,535 --> 00:12:26,955
Roll call.

135
00:12:28,936 --> 00:12:29,277
Graham?

136
00:12:29,757 --> 00:12:29,977
Yes.

137
00:12:30,477 --> 00:12:30,818
Kretz?

138
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:31,658
Yes.

139
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:32,879
McLaughlin?

140
00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:33,699
Yes.

141
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,620
McStone?

142
00:12:38,422 --> 00:12:40,924
Me, I see the thumbs up.

143
00:12:41,044 --> 00:12:41,644
Paul Rousseau?

144
00:12:42,264 --> 00:12:42,485
Yes.

145
00:12:43,105 --> 00:12:43,945
Van de Kloot, yes.

146
00:12:44,426 --> 00:12:44,966
Lungo Kern?

147
00:12:45,426 --> 00:12:45,586
Yes.

148
00:12:46,925 --> 00:12:49,489
Zero negative minutes are approved for 11 10 2020.

149
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:55,178
And then we also had a meeting last week on December 1st.

150
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:15,384
And in that meeting, we talked a bit about, we talked specifically about the technology and the structures that we have in place to ensure that we are able to communicate with our families and our communities.

151
00:13:15,444 --> 00:13:27,867
So we talked a fair bit about the various systems that the district uses in order to be able to communicate and some history around

152
00:13:29,571 --> 00:13:32,213
why we have had many platforms over the years.

153
00:13:33,374 --> 00:13:48,728
And the other thing we spent a fair bit of time talking about was the plans upcoming for really Medford Public Schools to sort of make a selection for a communication vehicle that is user friendly and can be widely deployed.

154
00:13:50,049 --> 00:14:06,049
And Dr. Cushing told us that that was sort of pre-COVID, it was on the roadmap for last summer, but that, you know, we made a decision and rightfully so to not disrupt our communication flows last summer amidst all the really important communication around COVID.

155
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:15,400
but that that is something that they are looking to return to the docket in this upcoming summer so that we can make that transition.

156
00:14:16,421 --> 00:14:23,266
We also had a good number of folks from our PTOs join us, and we talked a bit about

157
00:14:24,067 --> 00:14:39,078
communication options that might include requirements and needs that the PTOs have, where they sort of have the same challenges that we do as they are trying to reach and build their communities, and they may or may not have

158
00:14:39,923 --> 00:14:42,784
a good directory of sorts to help support that.

159
00:14:42,844 --> 00:14:46,045
So we talked a bit about what those requirements might be.

160
00:14:47,126 --> 00:14:56,089
We talked a bit about how to make sure that however we pursue a new application that we think about what those requirements are.

161
00:14:56,109 --> 00:15:01,310
And we were able to kind of talk through them in an initial draft in the meeting.

162
00:15:01,691 --> 00:15:08,553
And we talked a bit about certainly a desire on my part, but I think on lots of people's parts that

163
00:15:09,622 --> 00:15:31,014
However, we allow or enable our PTOs to use our platforms to communicate that it is not something that is reliant on a principle to have the sort of bandwidth or capacity to be in the middle of that communication, which is often the reality of how we have to do things today in many, many cases.

164
00:15:31,094 --> 00:15:36,997
So we talked a lot about, you know, wanting to make sure that there were some like rules of engagement and things that,

165
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:52,964
would be workable and that we would work together with that same group of individuals sort of as this unfolds to make sure that they have options as well to communicate with their respective communities.

166
00:15:53,084 --> 00:16:02,847
So there were a number of people from a number of PTO folks from various school buildings and there was definitely consensus around that.

167
00:16:03,407 --> 00:16:06,428
We also talked about communication platforms

168
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:16,097
in a broader sense to include the ways that teachers interact and converse and communicate with their families.

169
00:16:16,638 --> 00:16:28,588
And there was feedback in the meeting for us to really think about around the notion that literally every year, your child, especially at the elementary level,

170
00:16:29,365 --> 00:16:33,868
to a new teacher, they may have new platforms or protocols.

171
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:41,654
And so there's certainly a security step in all of those platforms, but then also a consistency step for families.

172
00:16:42,374 --> 00:16:44,896
There are districts that have a platform that they use.

173
00:16:45,636 --> 00:16:48,759
There are others that leave that up to the teachers.

174
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,700
And so, I mean, I think the group in general

175
00:16:51,255 --> 00:17:00,317
definitely wanted to know sort of how the teachers were feeling about that, but there was a desire from the parent community for some consistency in that regard as well.

176
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:06,838
So, that's a summary of our meeting on the 1st of December.

177
00:17:10,638 --> 00:17:11,178
Great, thank you.

178
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:14,379
Motion for approval?

179
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:17,720
Motion to approve.

180
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,400
Seconded by Member McLaughlin.

181
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:19,940
Roll call.

182
00:17:20,735 --> 00:17:20,995

183
00:17:21,535 --> 00:17:21,775
Yes.

184
00:17:22,236 --> 00:17:22,496
Yes.

185
00:17:23,096 --> 00:17:23,276
Yes.

186
00:17:23,756 --> 00:17:23,856
Yes.

187
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:24,157
Yes.

188
00:17:24,237 --> 00:17:24,337
Yes.

189
00:17:24,817 --> 00:17:25,137
Yes.

190
00:17:25,797 --> 00:17:25,977
Yes.

191
00:17:26,097 --> 00:17:26,297
Yes.

192
00:17:26,618 --> 00:17:26,938
Yes.

193
00:17:28,899 --> 00:17:29,159
Yes.

194
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:29,339
Yes.

195
00:17:29,459 --> 00:17:29,999
Yes.

196
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:30,279
Yes.

197
00:17:30,339 --> 00:17:30,479
Yes.

198
00:17:30,739 --> 00:17:30,979
Yes.

199
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:31,560
Yes.

200
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:31,660
Yes.

201
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:31,900
Yes.

202
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,140
Yes.

203
00:17:51,657 --> 00:17:51,997
Thank you.

204
00:17:52,017 --> 00:18:00,363
I want to thank my co-chairs, Paul Rousseau and Mia Mostow for the Behavioral Health and Special Education Subcommittee.

205
00:18:00,383 --> 00:18:02,364
We met, as you said, on the 19th

206
00:18:03,945 --> 00:18:18,050
Um, and we have identified, um, uh, this committee is a, is a, it has been a little bit tricky this year because it's behavioral health and special education, which are both very broad topics, as you can imagine, and very big topics.

207
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:31,975
Um, but we have the attendance, uh, regular attendance of the director of guidance, um, Stacey Shulman and the director of pupil services, Joan Bowen, um, and then several constituents from the community and, um,

208
00:18:32,757 --> 00:18:37,901
ongoing parent involvement and family engagement specific to those two topics.

209
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:43,105
We have identified trauma in trauma-informed schools as being our behavioral health

210
00:18:43,727 --> 00:18:52,836
topic of support for the year and thinking about ways to improve our school system around trauma informed schools.

211
00:18:53,336 --> 00:19:02,685
And right now we're really in this sort of collective research phase where we're meeting with each other, getting information and research and resources from

212
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:13,150
community members and folks that are attending and having discussion around what's currently happening in our schools regarding trauma-informed schools and what we would like to see happen.

213
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:24,555
Our goal is to probably in April of this year to have a presentation for the school committee with policy recommendations on those items.

214
00:19:24,675 --> 00:19:28,197
In the meantime, Stacey is working on

215
00:19:30,048 --> 00:19:40,378
trauma-informed practice with the school district around mindfulness and training about best practices in trauma-informed schools.

216
00:19:40,898 --> 00:19:47,985
And again, we're building research and resources for the community at large, teachers, staff, and family members.

217
00:19:49,186 --> 00:19:51,789
And then regarding special education, we're working on

218
00:19:52,637 --> 00:20:09,995
identifying ways in which we are building friendships for students with disabilities in our school to make it a priority, both for our our school committee, because we are, I think, representative of what we value and friendships are important in our schools.

219
00:20:10,056 --> 00:20:12,218
It's an important social emotional component and can be

220
00:20:12,762 --> 00:20:28,880
more difficult for students with disabilities so we're focusing specifically on fostering friendships in our both in our school programs that are wraparound services for example our morning programs are after school programs and our athletic programs.

221
00:20:30,421 --> 00:20:45,099
And out of school but community school based services so, and again we're collecting research and data right now on who's doing what and other districts, what we had acquired a friendship toolkit from an organization called the Arc of Massachusetts.

222
00:20:46,158 --> 00:20:52,284
which is a self-advocacy or advocacy organization that provides resources and support.

223
00:20:52,324 --> 00:20:54,526
So we are looking at that.

224
00:20:55,006 --> 00:21:00,311
We have a couple of parents that are very interested in exploring a Best Buddies program.

225
00:21:00,351 --> 00:21:02,613
We had formerly had a Best Buddies program in our schools.

226
00:21:03,742 --> 00:21:24,405
middle schools and so we're looking at piloting a best buddies program or something similar in our schools and we are looking at building a volunteer base for our recreation services among others for students who need it's again it could it could intersect with the friendship piece as well but it's for students who may need additional support say for example in recreation settings or

227
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:28,267
you know, Metro Recreation is certainly looking for volunteers.

228
00:21:28,327 --> 00:21:40,356
And we know that there are siblings out there that could additionally use some support, siblings of students with disabilities who could use support, but also could be a really great frontline for potential volunteers.

229
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:47,981
So we're excited about the work we're doing, and we'll continue with recommendations coming in the spring.

230
00:21:48,001 --> 00:21:51,503
And our next meeting is the 17th,

231
00:21:53,147 --> 00:21:56,248
of December at five o'clock, from five to 6.30.

232
00:21:56,748 --> 00:22:01,290
And if you find any of these topics interesting, we would welcome your attendance.

233
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:10,233
We welcome everyone's attendance, but specifically if you're interested in trauma-informed schools and building friendships for students with disabilities, please join us on the 19th.

234
00:22:10,514 --> 00:22:10,774
Thanks.

235
00:22:13,275 --> 00:22:14,395
Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

236
00:22:15,195 --> 00:22:21,718
Motion for approval by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member Van de Kloot.

237
00:22:21,878 --> 00:22:22,418
Roll call, please.

238
00:22:23,348 --> 00:22:23,668
Graham?

239
00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:24,289
Yes.

240
00:22:24,709 --> 00:22:25,029
Pretz?

241
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:25,750
Yes.

242
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:26,911
McLaughlin?

243
00:22:27,331 --> 00:22:27,651
Yes.

244
00:22:28,072 --> 00:22:28,192
Ms.

245
00:22:28,212 --> 00:22:28,552
Stone?

246
00:22:28,852 --> 00:22:29,152
Yes.

247
00:22:31,254 --> 00:22:31,694
Russo?

248
00:22:32,395 --> 00:22:32,595
Yes.

249
00:22:33,135 --> 00:22:33,675
Vanderclute?

250
00:22:33,715 --> 00:22:33,976
Yes.

251
00:22:34,716 --> 00:22:35,297
Lungo Kern?

252
00:22:36,597 --> 00:22:36,878
Yes.

253
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,359
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

254
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:39,660
Minutes are approved.

255
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,722
And next up we have Curriculum Subcommittee member Paulette Vanderclute.

256
00:22:44,143 --> 00:22:45,604
Approval of minutes from 11-18-2020 meeting.

257
00:22:48,006 --> 00:22:48,606
Member van de Kloop.

258
00:22:48,946 --> 00:22:49,326
Thank you.

259
00:22:49,947 --> 00:22:51,207
Yes, so we met on November 18.

260
00:22:51,827 --> 00:22:53,648
Present was myself, Jenny Graham.

261
00:22:54,448 --> 00:22:58,209
Mia could not make it, so Paul Rousseau attended in her place.

262
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:14,015
We began with a presentation from Tanya Sullivan and Alex Lark, co-chairs of the Medford CPAC, and they made a presentation reminding us that they speak for 20% of Medford Public Schools students and

263
00:23:14,998 --> 00:23:23,586
that they've been advocating for a disability awareness program for many years.

264
00:23:25,048 --> 00:23:34,697
Also, Melanie McLaughlin also attended, and she was the previous head of the CPAC, and also was very active in this program.

265
00:23:36,258 --> 00:23:37,879
advocating for this program.

266
00:23:38,899 --> 00:23:44,761
Joan Bowen and Susanna Campbell presented the disability awareness in the classroom presentation.

267
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:55,545
Susanna Campbell is presented an overview of the course that she ran last year and is going to now run again this January.

268
00:23:56,265 --> 00:23:57,866
The professional development is

269
00:23:58,446 --> 00:24:03,707
available on the Professional Development website and is now open for registration.

270
00:24:04,588 --> 00:24:06,788
It's open to all staff, not just teachers.

271
00:24:08,109 --> 00:24:14,290
The program is going to run Thursday afternoons from 3.15 to 5.15 in January and February via Zoom.

272
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:19,972
The course includes the history of disabilities in the U.S.,

273
00:24:20,973 --> 00:24:21,393
and U.S.

274
00:24:21,433 --> 00:24:49,527
legislation, ableism, belief in our society that not being disabled is the norm, disability etiquette, so teachers can model disability etiquette, and asking a person what they want, if they want assistance rather than stepping in, and the unique needs of students with various disabilities, and also tools to break down stereotypes.

275
00:24:50,640 --> 00:25:16,572
Key curricular concepts are positive representation of people with disabilities in content area lessons, universal design for learning helps all have better access, anti-ableism language practice into content area lessons, reframe misconceptions, building a more inclusive environment and creating a better community.

276
00:25:17,812 --> 00:25:18,552
The next steps,

277
00:25:20,517 --> 00:25:31,821
is to recruit is to have the PD course January and February of 2021 then recruit volunteers to pilot a disability awareness curriculum in February 2021 and then

278
00:25:33,541 --> 00:25:37,382
a pilot in classrooms, March to May 2021.

279
00:25:38,222 --> 00:25:43,944
This is not a one and done, and this is one of the most important things that really was stressed in the meeting.

280
00:25:45,504 --> 00:25:56,828
This disability awareness, we want it to be embedded into everyday instruction, so that it's not something that which simply just happens once, it's a, you know, get some fanfare, and then it's left behind.

281
00:25:57,268 --> 00:25:58,148
Rather, the concept

282
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:02,191
and the awareness needs to be embedded into the curriculum so it is ongoing.

283
00:26:02,371 --> 00:26:03,752
That was a very important point.

284
00:26:05,493 --> 00:26:12,818
We talked about a book that one fifth grade teacher was using and the lesson plans that had come out of that.

285
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:21,844
Last time, 48 teachers took the course and it's hoping that there will be as many this time.

286
00:26:24,761 --> 00:26:26,581
It's done on a volunteer basis.

287
00:26:28,762 --> 00:26:36,124
And the end result is creating curriculum units that can be shared amongst our staff.

288
00:26:41,585 --> 00:26:47,227
Again, we talked a little bit about why we weren't doing a specialized curriculum, but rather embedding it in.

289
00:26:50,046 --> 00:27:03,637
CPAC had done research on this in past years and there had been an attempt at the one school, but it ended up being a special event rather than having the long-term impact.

290
00:27:05,659 --> 00:27:06,179
Let's see.

291
00:27:09,742 --> 00:27:12,064
We're starting from the pilot and we're growing from there.

292
00:27:12,084 --> 00:27:12,144
And

293
00:27:18,047 --> 00:27:21,191
Susanna Campbell mentioned that we're taking a two-pronged course.

294
00:27:21,711 --> 00:27:23,133
One is about teaching students.

295
00:27:23,413 --> 00:27:30,220
The other part is teaching teachers to use universal design to help them become more knowledgeable about disabilities.

296
00:27:35,033 --> 00:27:40,116
We've asked that there would be a report and update at the end of the year, and that's been scheduled.

297
00:27:41,957 --> 00:27:57,247
And so we'll be reporting back to the committee about how many teachers signed up and took the course and how many volunteers we had and how we were able to implement this this year, this year being 2021 in the spring.

298
00:27:59,568 --> 00:28:02,890
Lastly, I just want to mention to you that the

299
00:28:04,986 --> 00:28:09,349
The next meeting is on December 10th, but that is this Thursday.

300
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:11,671
And we're going to be looking at the math curriculum.

301
00:28:12,091 --> 00:28:31,444
We also wanted to convey our thanks both to the, particularly to Tanya Sullivan and Alex Lorick of the CPAC and to Susanna Campbell and Joan Bowen for all the work they did in giving the information for us for this subcommittee.

302
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:32,865
That's it.

303
00:28:34,709 --> 00:28:35,429
Motion to approve.

304
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:39,692
Motion to approve by member Van de Kloet, seconded by member Kratz.

305
00:28:40,592 --> 00:28:44,334
That was member McLaughlin, Mayor.

306
00:28:44,394 --> 00:28:46,015
Member McLaughlin, seconded by member Kratz.

307
00:28:46,055 --> 00:28:46,935
Yes, sorry, that's what I meant.

308
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:47,696
Thank you.

309
00:28:47,856 --> 00:28:48,216
Roll call.

310
00:28:48,776 --> 00:28:49,116
Graham?

311
00:28:49,597 --> 00:28:49,797
Yes.

312
00:28:50,217 --> 00:28:50,517
Kratz?

313
00:28:51,097 --> 00:28:51,317
Yes.

314
00:28:51,738 --> 00:28:52,298
McLaughlin?

315
00:28:53,078 --> 00:28:53,338
Yes.

316
00:28:53,739 --> 00:28:54,199
McStone?

317
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:54,859
Yes.

318
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,360
Rousseau?

319
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:57,300
Yes.

320
00:28:57,801 --> 00:28:58,601
Van de Kloet, yes.

321
00:28:59,722 --> 00:29:00,302
Lungo Kern?

322
00:29:00,902 --> 00:29:01,082
Yes.

323
00:29:01,122 --> 00:29:02,443
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

324
00:29:04,094 --> 00:29:04,314
Yes.

325
00:29:04,614 --> 00:29:07,475
May I just ask, do we have a student representative tonight?

326
00:29:08,535 --> 00:29:09,676
I see a student on the call.

327
00:29:09,696 --> 00:29:11,557
Do you want to introduce yourself?

328
00:29:12,237 --> 00:29:12,837
Colin.

329
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:14,658
Yeah.

330
00:29:14,678 --> 00:29:15,038
Hi there.

331
00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:16,739
I'm Colin Bailey.

332
00:29:16,979 --> 00:29:17,559
I'm a senior.

333
00:29:18,579 --> 00:29:21,361
And yeah, I'm just, it's an honor to be here.

334
00:29:21,381 --> 00:29:22,881
I'm very happy to work along with you.

335
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,342
And yeah, I hope to make this the best that it can be.

336
00:29:26,002 --> 00:29:27,563
Thank you so much for attending Colin.

337
00:29:28,243 --> 00:29:28,704
Welcome.

338
00:29:29,264 --> 00:29:29,604
Welcome.

339
00:29:29,624 --> 00:29:30,444
It's an honor to have you.

340
00:29:30,824 --> 00:29:31,945
Let us know if you have any questions.

341
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:49,417
Next up, we have committee of the whole special school committee meeting offered by myself, minutes from 11-24-2020, which was last week when we discussed the school metrics, COVID-19 school metrics.

342
00:29:52,439 --> 00:29:53,819
Motion for approval of the minutes.

343
00:29:56,821 --> 00:29:57,561
Motion to approve.

344
00:29:57,981 --> 00:29:58,661
Second.

345
00:29:58,721 --> 00:29:59,862
Seconded by Member Van de Kloot.

346
00:29:59,922 --> 00:30:00,322
Roll call.

347
00:30:02,479 --> 00:30:02,719
Yes.

348
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:03,860
Yes.

349
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:04,720
Yes.

350
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:05,340
Yes.

351
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:05,440
Yes.

352
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:05,680
Yes.

353
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:05,900
Yes.

354
00:30:06,781 --> 00:30:07,081
Yes.

355
00:30:07,581 --> 00:30:07,761
Yes.

356
00:30:07,861 --> 00:30:08,041
Yes.

357
00:30:08,401 --> 00:30:08,701
Yes.

358
00:30:10,362 --> 00:30:10,542
Yes.

359
00:30:10,902 --> 00:30:11,162
Yes.

360
00:30:11,182 --> 00:30:11,322
Yes.

361
00:30:13,063 --> 00:30:13,283
Yes.

362
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:14,163
Yes.

363
00:30:14,183 --> 00:30:14,284
Yes.

364
00:30:14,404 --> 00:30:14,504
Yes.

365
00:30:14,524 --> 00:30:14,804
Yes.

366
00:30:15,424 --> 00:30:15,604
Yes.

367
00:30:15,684 --> 00:30:15,844
Yes.

368
00:30:15,864 --> 00:30:15,944
Yes.

369
00:30:15,964 --> 00:30:16,084
Yes.

370
00:30:16,104 --> 00:30:16,224
Yes.

371
00:30:16,244 --> 00:30:16,524
Yes.

372
00:30:16,864 --> 00:30:17,045
Yes.

373
00:30:31,778 --> 00:30:36,961
Those submitting must include the following information, your first and last name, your Method Street address, your question or comment.

374
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,763
Member Rousseau, do we have any emails yet?

375
00:30:40,664 --> 00:30:43,345
We do, thank you, Mayor.

376
00:30:44,706 --> 00:30:53,952
We have a request from Joanne McKay of Court Street in Medford who would like to speak or would like to make a statement on behalf of the Roberts Elementary School.

377
00:30:54,673 --> 00:30:54,973
Okay.

378
00:30:55,093 --> 00:30:55,993
I believe she is on.

379
00:30:58,275 --> 00:31:01,517
If she could just raise her hand, that would make it easy to find so we can unmute.

380
00:31:17,735 --> 00:31:18,195
find her, Peter?

381
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:20,195
Yeah, I'm trying to unmute now.

382
00:31:20,355 --> 00:31:20,956
Oh, sorry.

383
00:31:21,636 --> 00:31:23,636
Yeah, sometimes it's sticky.

384
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:27,517
There you go.

385
00:31:28,097 --> 00:31:28,257
Ms.

386
00:31:28,277 --> 00:31:29,517
McKay, you should be unmuted now.

387
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:31,097
Sure, can you hear me?

388
00:31:31,437 --> 00:31:31,677
Yes.

389
00:31:32,417 --> 00:31:38,158
Okay, thank you very much for having me be able to speak tonight.

390
00:31:38,498 --> 00:31:41,599
So I just have a little statement on behalf of the Roberts School.

391
00:31:41,639 --> 00:31:43,179
I'm sorry if you can't hear me very well.

392
00:31:43,199 --> 00:31:46,900
It doesn't necessitate that I'm wearing a mask in my situation right now.

393
00:31:48,086 --> 00:31:53,510
So things have been changing rapidly at the Roberts School.

394
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:56,431
So this is a letter that we wrote today.

395
00:31:56,812 --> 00:32:08,779
So it says, dear Dr. Edouard Vincent, Dr. Murphy, Mr. Murphy, Dr. Cushing, and Mrs. Galluzzi, we're writing this letter out of care and concern for our coworkers and students at the Roberts Elementary School.

396
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:18,286
The recent rise in positive cases of COVID-19 and the need to quarantine teachers, paraprofessionals, and students has us deeply concerned.

397
00:32:18,886 --> 00:32:25,571
Currently, we have eight classroom teachers, four paraprofessionals, and three support staff teachers in quarantine.

398
00:32:26,431 --> 00:32:31,233
Some of the staff members have tested positive and are not just quarantined due to being close contacts.

399
00:32:31,933 --> 00:32:34,834
Almost all of those quarantined are from exposure at school.

400
00:32:35,474 --> 00:32:40,816
We just had 11 staff members return last week from quarantine due to exposure at school.

401
00:32:41,736 --> 00:32:49,839
We also have cohorts in quarantine as well as many individual students in various classrooms due to either testing positive or being exposed.

402
00:32:50,801 --> 00:32:54,946
We are unsure of how we can sustain educating our students at this rate.

403
00:32:55,547 --> 00:33:01,314
We are concerned that due to coverage, the cohorts are being cohorts are being exposed to many various people.

404
00:33:02,158 --> 00:33:12,983
We are concerned that support staff is not aware that they may have been a close contact and are in constant state of worry and anxiety in regards to whether or not they are close contacts.

405
00:33:13,683 --> 00:33:16,004
They are nervous about being in and out of many rooms.

406
00:33:16,764 --> 00:33:30,310
Despite the diligence of our custodial staff cleaning and disinfecting our buildings continuously and the adherence of the staff and students to state safety protocols, our numbers are rising at a rate that we find alarming.

407
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:35,651
This is greatly affecting the mental health and well-being of the staff and the students.

408
00:33:36,451 --> 00:33:43,113
Many are reporting high anxiety and sleepless nights due to concerns for the safety of themselves and their family members.

409
00:33:43,833 --> 00:33:52,715
We willingly returned to school when we were asked to, and we are working harder than we have ever have to provide our students with a quality education in these uncertain times.

410
00:33:53,515 --> 00:33:57,076
In order for us to continue in this manner, we need to feel safe.

411
00:33:57,536 --> 00:34:00,297
And due to recent events, we do not feel safe.

412
00:34:01,137 --> 00:34:11,960
We respectfully ask that you have the Roberts Elementary move into a remote phase for a period of time to help stop the spread in our community and keep our faculty and students safe.

413
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,321
Thank you for your attention to this matter.

414
00:34:17,481 --> 00:34:18,022
Thank you, Ms.

415
00:34:18,042 --> 00:34:18,382
McKay.

416
00:34:21,883 --> 00:34:22,743
Ms.

417
00:34:22,783 --> 00:34:23,143
Douglas.

418
00:34:29,374 --> 00:34:33,677
Thank you, Charlene Douglas, 414 High Street Method Mass.

419
00:34:33,737 --> 00:34:50,088
First and foremost, I want to give a shout out to Superintendent Dr. Edwin Vincent, Mr. Murphy, and the administrative staff for the hard work they have been doing to get us back into the schools, the testing that's in place.

420
00:34:51,169 --> 00:34:57,173
It has been a true privilege to have that testing so that we can

421
00:34:57,597 --> 00:34:59,698
keep track of what's happening within our schools.

422
00:35:00,478 --> 00:35:08,501
That being said, I want to speak tonight on behalf of the membership as the MTA president.

423
00:35:09,281 --> 00:35:20,645
So the membership and the MTA executive board are very concerned with the recent uptick of cases within the community and the impact this is having on the schools.

424
00:35:21,325 --> 00:35:25,547
Both the Roberts and the Brooks Elementary Schools were severely impacted today.

425
00:35:26,048 --> 00:35:31,010
with staffing issues and hybrid classes are now forced to go remote for the period of two weeks.

426
00:35:31,631 --> 00:35:42,296
The Roberts, as you heard, has eight classroom teachers, four paraprofessionals, and three support staff teachers in quarantine that have been tested positive or have been deemed close contact.

427
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:49,719
The number of confirmed student positive cases to the best of our knowledge at this time at the Roberts is six.

428
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:54,942
The Brooks Elementary had nine teachers and four other staff members that have

429
00:35:55,346 --> 00:35:57,968
tested positive or been deemed close contacts.

430
00:35:58,628 --> 00:36:03,892
The MTA knows of five positive student cases at the Brooks at this time.

431
00:36:04,652 --> 00:36:11,677
We are concerned as to how we can maintain the health and safety of the teachers, staff and students during this period of time.

432
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:22,525
With the number of staffs impacted by the above situation, we are concerned by asking additional people outside the cohort to cover the in-person cohorts.

433
00:36:23,993 --> 00:36:27,514
with increased risk to the school and to the community.

434
00:36:28,414 --> 00:36:33,876
To demonstrate the uptick in new cases, I'm citing the state report dated December 3rd.

435
00:36:34,516 --> 00:36:40,978
Method reported having 254 cases in a 14-day period ending on December 1st.

436
00:36:41,538 --> 00:36:48,120
In the last seven days, Method has reported 295 new cases in seven days.

437
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:49,641
We have doubled the numbers.

438
00:36:50,983 --> 00:37:00,091
We understand and really truly know that it is better and best to teach in person and students learn better.

439
00:37:00,771 --> 00:37:16,465
But due to this high risk and the uptick in cases in the community, as well as the justified concern of our staff about their health and wellbeing, we strongly believe that we should be engaging in remote instruction until after the winter break.

440
00:37:17,908 --> 00:37:24,991
We ask that you take this action for the overall safety and well-being of the staff and the students of the Memphis Public Schools.

441
00:37:25,892 --> 00:37:38,678
Again, this is not an easy statement for me to read tonight because I too want all the students in, but we are frightened and we are scared and we have staff members coming down rapidly every day.

442
00:37:39,618 --> 00:37:40,339
Thank you for your time.

443
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:42,460
Thank you, Ms.

444
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:42,820
Douglas.

445
00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:47,282
Member Van de Kloot.

446
00:37:51,294 --> 00:37:54,417
And I know we're getting to this topic with Ms.

447
00:37:55,078 --> 00:38:03,025
Tony Ray in probably 10 minutes, but maybe Vandaclute, you're on mute.

448
00:38:04,807 --> 00:38:06,028
Always trying to shut me up some way.

449
00:38:06,048 --> 00:38:16,538
All right, so I just, just for the public, we're not, I'm not going to address this right now only because I think we have some reports coming and we certainly will have some questions.

450
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:23,367
Remember?

451
00:38:23,387 --> 00:38:25,028
So any other emails that you have right now?

452
00:38:29,031 --> 00:38:29,432
No, Mayor.

453
00:38:29,752 --> 00:38:30,092
Thank you.

454
00:38:30,452 --> 00:38:30,772
Thank you.

455
00:38:33,034 --> 00:38:33,594
Yeah, we'll get into that.

456
00:38:33,614 --> 00:38:41,060
We're gonna do the superintendent's update and comments, and then we're getting right to number two, which is COVID-19 public health update and testing.

457
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,961
Melanie has her hand up.

458
00:38:43,401 --> 00:38:44,162
Member McLaughlin.

459
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:46,126
Thank you, Mayor.

460
00:38:46,166 --> 00:38:55,809
I just wanted to thank Charlene and Miss McKay for their statements, and I'm assuming that we will circle back after the reports.

461
00:38:55,869 --> 00:38:58,790
Is that what you were saying, Member van de Kloot?

462
00:39:00,191 --> 00:39:00,391
Yes.

463
00:39:00,791 --> 00:39:01,011
Okay.

464
00:39:01,351 --> 00:39:02,572
I just want to say thank you as well.

465
00:39:02,612 --> 00:39:02,972
Thank you.

466
00:39:05,993 --> 00:39:09,354
Dr. Edward Vincent, Superintendent's updates and comments.

467
00:39:10,235 --> 00:39:15,804
Yes, and I wanna say good evening to everyone and thank you, Ms.

468
00:39:15,824 --> 00:39:18,067
McKay and Ms.

469
00:39:18,087 --> 00:39:21,513
Charlene Douglas for sharing your thoughts and concerns with us.

470
00:39:21,573 --> 00:39:25,499
And I hope that after today's reports are presented,

471
00:39:26,816 --> 00:39:36,867
that it will provide additional peace of mind and know that we are all working together on behalf of the students.

472
00:39:37,428 --> 00:39:39,470
So I do wanna say that.

473
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:43,995
Good evening, I have some remarks to share with everyone.

474
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:51,073
So first it does give me great pleasure to welcome our two school committee representatives.

475
00:39:52,195 --> 00:39:53,236
I was muted.

476
00:39:53,297 --> 00:39:56,482
I tried to unmute before and it wasn't cooperating with me.

477
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:10,305
So we have two students that will be participating with us, Colin Bailey, and also David Mai, who is from the vocational side, majoring in business marketing.

478
00:40:11,186 --> 00:40:16,888
And so I wasn't sure if both of them were online since I'm on a different device.

479
00:40:19,702 --> 00:40:27,325
Welcome, and I know this is an unusual kind of formal welcome, but I am excited to say that we do have two students.

480
00:40:27,945 --> 00:40:39,350
Colin from the comprehensive side of the school, Colin Bailey, who's a senior, and David Mai, who is on the vocational side of the house in the business marketing.

481
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:40,551
So welcome to you both.

482
00:40:41,591 --> 00:40:45,793
And thank you for your student leadership on the school committee.

483
00:40:48,073 --> 00:41:02,078
I wanted to acknowledge that today, December 7th, is the anniversary of Pearl Harbor Day.

484
00:41:02,138 --> 00:41:13,982
The 79th anniversary is a day when Pearl Harbor survivors, their families and veterans from all over the world come together to honor and remember

485
00:41:14,741 --> 00:41:27,850
the 2,403 service members and civilians who were killed during that attack that took place at Pearl Harbor on December 7th, 1941.

486
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:41,640
I would like us to just take, if possible, a brief moment of silence just to remember that generation who didn't hesitate at that point in time to answer the call to protect our freedoms.

487
00:41:42,521 --> 00:41:44,122
They put their lives on hold

488
00:41:44,571 --> 00:41:45,371
for the greater good.

489
00:41:52,874 --> 00:41:53,314
Thank you.

490
00:41:54,054 --> 00:42:00,216
Believe it or not, our band was scheduled to be in Honolulu this week.

491
00:42:01,256 --> 00:42:10,499
On Friday, on my calendar, I had my calendar alert pop up and it said, fly to Hawaii.

492
00:42:11,059 --> 00:42:11,620
And I too,

493
00:42:13,211 --> 00:42:22,217
You know, I'm an avid fan of our band, but I wanted to go to Hawaii to see them play and perform in the parade.

494
00:42:23,718 --> 00:42:27,521
But as you know, due to the virus, we're not able to travel.

495
00:42:28,602 --> 00:42:38,409
I know that it was a great, great disappointment for everyone, especially our band students who were practicing for so many years to be able to go and really display their talents.

496
00:42:40,592 --> 00:42:52,740
So, you know, we're sorry that this opportunity couldn't happen, but again, I just want to recognize you as well and knowing that you would have been there playing in their parade that was going to take place.

497
00:42:53,740 --> 00:43:00,284
But nonetheless, I want to put the band on everyone's radar for you to come out and please support our band.

498
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:08,009
This past weekend, the Mustang Band parents hosted a tree and reef sale in the Medford High parking lot.

499
00:43:09,529 --> 00:43:14,551
If you missed it, they'll be there again this weekend from 10 a.m.

500
00:43:14,612 --> 00:43:15,452
to 4 p.m.

501
00:43:15,672 --> 00:43:16,833
on Saturday and Sunday.

502
00:43:17,473 --> 00:43:25,177
I want you to know I picked up my tree and wreaths this weekend and my six foot tree, which is right behind me, it's still settling in.

503
00:43:25,637 --> 00:43:30,939
So I haven't put the lights on yet, but it's a beautiful tree that's very full and very fragrant.

504
00:43:31,019 --> 00:43:35,442
So those of you who are getting Christmas trees, I encourage you to go out and support our band.

505
00:43:36,862 --> 00:43:44,907
Additionally, I wanted to share that a number of our PTOs are selling gift cards and school merchandise for the holidays.

506
00:43:46,829 --> 00:43:57,195
The Medford High School and the Medford Vocational Technical High School PTO, they currently have a fundraiser going on with the Pampered Chef and the Texas Roadhouse.

507
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:07,184
The friends of Medford rowing, our crew students are also hosting a calendar raffle during the month of January.

508
00:44:07,204 --> 00:44:12,126
And it's $10 for a raffle ticket, $3 for 25 tickets.

509
00:44:12,846 --> 00:44:18,549
And you have an opportunity to win a gift card every day during the month of January.

510
00:44:19,209 --> 00:44:21,070
So if you're able to support our

511
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:23,771
crew students that would be wonderful.

512
00:44:24,532 --> 00:44:29,355
The Brooks PTO is also holding its silent auction this week.

513
00:44:30,796 --> 00:44:34,498
I was fortunate to win when they did one of their auctions.

514
00:44:34,998 --> 00:44:37,320
So please support their PTO as well.

515
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:44,044
The Columbus PTO is looking for gift card donations for their community.

516
00:44:44,624 --> 00:44:44,864
So

517
00:44:46,005 --> 00:44:54,631
Again, we appreciate all of these volunteers whose dedication and commitment to our school community continues even during COVID.

518
00:44:56,552 --> 00:45:03,777
So as we meet tonight, we do so with COVID cases rising, both here and throughout the state.

519
00:45:05,018 --> 00:45:14,064
I do realize that people may be tired of wearing masks, social distancing, and washing their hands, but we need to continue to remain vigilant.

520
00:45:16,179 --> 00:45:24,244
If not for you and your own family, let's do it for the kids in our community who want to continue to attend in-school learning.

521
00:45:25,364 --> 00:45:30,447
So please continue to work with us and take the proper and necessary precautions.

522
00:45:31,408 --> 00:45:35,210
We need to be in this together because divided, we will fall.

523
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:37,051
So let's go Mustangs.

524
00:45:37,451 --> 00:45:40,993
Please keep the faith and we'll continue to push forward.

525
00:45:42,654 --> 00:45:43,475
This past week,

526
00:45:44,398 --> 00:45:57,709
The Medford Public Schools in collaboration with the City of Medford's Board of Health, Armstrong Ambulance, the Broad Institute, Tufts University, we began our student COVID testing program.

527
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:06,536
Students are swabbed by healthcare professionals in elementary schools and they swab themselves at the secondary level.

528
00:46:07,396 --> 00:46:13,061
It is a PCR test that has been shown to have an extremely high accuracy rate.

529
00:46:14,392 --> 00:46:18,313
It's the same test that all staff, NPS staff are using.

530
00:46:19,973 --> 00:46:22,874
Again, please know that these tests don't hurt.

531
00:46:23,494 --> 00:46:25,235
I shared a little video last week.

532
00:46:25,355 --> 00:46:27,355
It truly is a painless experience.

533
00:46:28,055 --> 00:46:32,577
So I am encouraging families to sign up.

534
00:46:32,697 --> 00:46:36,277
If you have not signed consent forms, please do so.

535
00:46:36,498 --> 00:46:42,219
We really are shooting to have 100% participation from all students.

536
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:47,791
Um, so we want testing to continue.

537
00:46:47,831 --> 00:46:55,853
That's our hope, um, in January of 21, but we are still looking at additional funding, but we will keep you informed.

538
00:46:57,333 --> 00:47:12,337
We're also grateful and thankful to nurse Tony Ray and all the school nurses who are overseeing this important program, as well as Marianne O'Connor and Medford's board of health, who are also assisting with the testing.

539
00:47:13,502 --> 00:47:32,568
So in order for the student testing to run smoothly and to minimize time away from instruction, I wanna thank members of our Mustang school community, administrative assistants, central administration staff, and members of the Medford Fire Department who assisted with the registration process.

540
00:47:33,409 --> 00:47:40,811
Everything we have been doing is important to keep our school hybrid option still functioning.

541
00:47:41,772 --> 00:47:43,052
All hands are needed on deck

542
00:47:43,593 --> 00:47:46,995
and it is gratifying to see so many people jumping in.

543
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:55,799
I am pleased to announce that this Thursday, December 10th, our seniors are coming back to the high school.

544
00:47:57,259 --> 00:48:01,381
December 10th is cohort C, and on Monday, December 14th, cohort B.

545
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:19,226
So I wanna say thank you to the seniors, to their families who showed incredible patience while we were working aggressively on our HVAC systems to make sure that we met the heightened air quality standards that were necessitated by this pandemic.

546
00:48:20,267 --> 00:48:27,510
So we know that the work is ongoing and we look forward to welcoming grades nine, 10, and 11 in the new year.

547
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:29,971
So stay tuned, that will be coming.

548
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:51,311
So as part of our re-entry for our grade 12 students, and given the known risks of opening school among older and more independent students, we will be offering free COVID-9 testing to all students and staff returning to Medford High School prior to their arrival.

549
00:48:52,852 --> 00:48:58,635
So Medford High School seniors who are in cohort C, that means you're coming to school on Thursday,

550
00:48:59,882 --> 00:49:04,204
You are asked to come to the high school tomorrow between 3 p.m.

551
00:49:04,544 --> 00:49:05,405
and 6 p.m.

552
00:49:06,925 --> 00:49:09,246
Again, tomorrow between 3 p.m.

553
00:49:09,367 --> 00:49:11,968
and 6 p.m., Tuesday, December 8th.

554
00:49:13,008 --> 00:49:19,251
Seniors who are waiting to come back, cohort C on Thursday, you need to come and take your test.

555
00:49:21,212 --> 00:49:24,914
Students that are returning, cohort B students who are returning on Monday,

556
00:49:26,449 --> 00:49:33,671
your testing day will be Friday, December 11th, this Friday afternoon, between 3 p.m.

557
00:49:33,831 --> 00:49:34,611
and 6 p.m.

558
00:49:36,251 --> 00:49:41,773
Again, in collaboration with the Broad Institute, the results come within 24 hours.

559
00:49:43,513 --> 00:49:47,234
You put your email address and it will be emailed to your parents.

560
00:49:48,375 --> 00:49:51,055
So there's a quick turnaround with the results.

561
00:49:51,635 --> 00:49:52,696
So please, 3 p.m.

562
00:49:52,736 --> 00:49:53,196
to 6 p.m.,

563
00:49:55,333 --> 00:50:02,557
tomorrow for Cohort C students and Friday, December 11th for Cohort B students.

564
00:50:02,997 --> 00:50:12,102
It's very important and we look forward to seeing you tomorrow and Friday for testing and welcoming back Cohort C on Thursday.

565
00:50:13,412 --> 00:50:23,394
I wanna just say now a quick thank you again for collaboration from the Neighborhood Kitchen and the West Medford Community Center over the holiday break.

566
00:50:24,014 --> 00:50:34,296
They were really able to serve families that were in need and they were able to serve 107 free meals to Medford residents.

567
00:50:34,776 --> 00:50:38,717
So we just wanna extend a very special thank you to the Neighborhood Kitchen

568
00:50:39,257 --> 00:50:45,161
and the West Medford Community Center for their collaboration and just taking care of the community.

569
00:50:45,722 --> 00:50:48,143
Thank you for being honorary Mustangs.

570
00:50:50,845 --> 00:51:07,677
Just a reminder to parents and caregivers, you should have received a survey from your respective principal stating that the survey requests feedback from students about students' educational experiences during this first marking term.

571
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:11,752
Please know that the surveys are due back tomorrow.

572
00:51:12,392 --> 00:51:18,356
It's our hope that parents and caregivers will be able to take the time to complete the survey.

573
00:51:19,237 --> 00:51:25,341
The survey will only assist us as we move forward with this unprecedented school year.

574
00:51:26,061 --> 00:51:30,704
If you did not receive the survey, please reach out to your school principal.

575
00:51:32,425 --> 00:51:34,847
I would also like to recognize that last week,

576
00:51:35,816 --> 00:51:46,523
students at the McGlynn Elementary School had the opportunity to engage with both Attorney General Maura Healey's office and the iRobot company.

577
00:51:47,784 --> 00:51:49,585
Thanks to our computer teacher, Ms.

578
00:51:49,725 --> 00:51:52,127
Elias, the students in Ms.

579
00:51:52,167 --> 00:51:58,831
Notaro's grade five class, they were able to work remotely along with iRobot on a project.

580
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:02,826
Additionally, earlier in the week, Ms.

581
00:52:02,946 --> 00:52:11,335
Elias' class welcomed the Attorney General's Director of Community Engagement Division, Mr. Marconi Almeida Barros.

582
00:52:12,296 --> 00:52:22,666
He spoke with EL newcomer students about the importance of staying safe online, as well as how to spot and prevent online scams.

583
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,121
He also discussed the work of the attorney general.

584
00:52:26,822 --> 00:52:39,688
The students engaged in conversations with Mr. Almeida Barros, who also was kind enough to share his journey as the first Latino to be elected as a school committee member in Everett.

585
00:52:40,688 --> 00:52:45,450
He told them how everything is possible if you work hard and do your best.

586
00:52:47,411 --> 00:52:48,892
So in this season of giving,

587
00:52:50,727 --> 00:52:55,891
Once again, our Medford Family Network is looking for help from the community.

588
00:52:56,311 --> 00:52:57,993
So we're asking you to help again.

589
00:52:58,013 --> 00:53:12,144
Our Medford Family Network, they are in need of people who might want to adopt a family, in need for the holidays, and donate a gift card to Target, Market Basket, Marshalls, or Kohl's.

590
00:53:13,204 --> 00:53:18,268
Those who might be able to assist in any way can contact Marie Cassidy at 781

591
00:53:19,784 --> 00:53:20,585
393-2106.

592
00:53:21,225 --> 00:53:27,171
The MFN is a special jewel in our school community.

593
00:53:27,591 --> 00:53:36,159
And like most nonprofits, they have been unable to fundraise much during this pandemic, but the needs continue.

594
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:41,104
And so we'd appreciate any support that you would like to provide to them.

595
00:53:43,931 --> 00:54:01,198
I also want the community to know that as we continue to have meetings and meetings are being added, please be advised that all school committee meetings, including our subcommittee meetings, that they've been posted to the school website, the school Facebook page, and the school blog.

596
00:54:04,303 --> 00:54:08,225
So I wanna say that COVID has affected many, many things.

597
00:54:08,565 --> 00:54:12,046
And one of the things that it also affected is Girl Scout cookies.

598
00:54:12,606 --> 00:54:15,767
We have a lot of members of our community that are Girl Scouts.

599
00:54:16,428 --> 00:54:21,009
And like everything else, cookie sales have been forced to go online.

600
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:30,293
So for those of you in our community who might be interested, please go to our school blog for additional information on how to place an order.

601
00:54:32,153 --> 00:54:45,021
I also want you to know that CCSR, our Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility, they're hosting a school supplies drive from now all the way until December 14th.

602
00:54:46,022 --> 00:54:50,805
Drop boxes are located at City Hall and all of our K-8 schools.

603
00:54:51,945 --> 00:55:00,391
They are collecting the following items, pencils, pens, notebooks, glue sticks, markers, crayons, pencil cases,

604
00:55:01,387 --> 00:55:06,929
dry erase boards, scissors, disposable masks, erasers, folders, and rulers.

605
00:55:08,689 --> 00:55:17,572
If you want to support the CCSR drive, please, you can drop those, go to the drop boxes at City Hall or at our K-8 schools.

606
00:55:19,593 --> 00:55:25,134
Lastly, I'd like to say that this Thursday, December 10th, is Hanukkah.

607
00:55:26,435 --> 00:55:29,796
And it begins on December 10th and it ends on December 18th.

608
00:55:31,213 --> 00:55:41,021
The miracle of Hanukkah is that only one vial of oil was found with just enough oil to illuminate the Holy Temple in Jerusalem for one day.

609
00:55:41,822 --> 00:55:45,505
Yet the oil lasted for eight full days.

610
00:55:46,506 --> 00:55:49,228
The word Hanukkah means dedication in Hebrew.

611
00:55:50,309 --> 00:55:52,731
Hanukkah is also called the Festival of Lights.

612
00:55:53,612 --> 00:55:59,417
To all our Jewish friends and neighbors, the Mustang community wishes you a most wonderful, safe,

613
00:55:59,825 --> 00:56:01,646
and healthy Hanukkah season.

614
00:56:02,247 --> 00:56:04,168
Thank you, and have a good evening.

615
00:56:06,269 --> 00:56:06,489
Mayor.

616
00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:09,231
Member Russo, then Member McLaughlin.

617
00:56:10,172 --> 00:56:10,512
Thank you.

618
00:56:10,772 --> 00:56:15,255
We do have an email that came in, and it's, I think, fine.

619
00:56:15,415 --> 00:56:18,557
It makes sense to read it after the superintendent's comments.

620
00:56:18,617 --> 00:56:23,680
It's from Campbell Tacey at Lawler Road in Medford, who I believe is a student.

621
00:56:24,321 --> 00:56:28,003
Hello, I just wanted to make a comment and commend the school committee and the administration

622
00:56:28,591 --> 00:56:31,333
on finally giving high school seniors a return date for school.

623
00:56:31,994 --> 00:56:38,959
Despite what other citizens have shared today on the call, offering hybrid as an option has been proven safe by the data.

624
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:47,806
As someone with a passion for science, I appreciate an administration that is willing to listen to science and the data and get kids back in school.

625
00:56:47,907 --> 00:56:50,008
Thank you so much for your months of work.

626
00:56:50,188 --> 00:56:55,673
And on behalf of my fellow seniors, we are so incredibly excited to be able to attend school on Thursday.

627
00:56:55,753 --> 00:56:56,874
Thank you for all you've done.

628
00:57:00,985 --> 00:57:01,325
Thank you.

629
00:57:01,385 --> 00:57:02,546
Member Russo, appreciate that.

630
00:57:02,606 --> 00:57:03,287
Member McLaughlin.

631
00:57:04,607 --> 00:57:05,308
Thank you, Mayor.

632
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:07,950
Thank you, Superintendent, for the update.

633
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:13,173
And thank you for coordinating testing for our seniors to come back to school.

634
00:57:13,213 --> 00:57:14,254
I think that's really important.

635
00:57:14,294 --> 00:57:15,595
It's really great to see that happening.

636
00:57:16,596 --> 00:57:29,044
I did want to ask, is there going to be a robo-call since there's such quick turnaround for Cohort B, that it's three o'clock tomorrow, and we want to make sure that everybody gets notice and information on getting the test.

637
00:57:29,244 --> 00:57:30,265
And then the other question is,

638
00:57:31,968 --> 00:57:35,930
for those, what happens if students don't get the test or don't take the test?

639
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:42,632
Mr., the first, the first ask about the robocall, Mr. DeLava will be right on top of that one.

640
00:57:42,672 --> 00:57:45,313
So that can definitely happen for tomorrow.

641
00:57:45,333 --> 00:57:48,514
Um, he can probably get one, a phone call out tonight.

642
00:57:48,955 --> 00:57:50,315
So your phone may ring Ms.

643
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:50,835
McLaughlin.

644
00:57:52,156 --> 00:57:56,497
Uh, he can get one out tonight and we can resend it again tomorrow from three to six.

645
00:57:56,577 --> 00:57:57,998
And I hope, um,

646
00:57:58,555 --> 00:58:15,127
with the seniors as they know that their return date, he's been communicating with them quite frequently, but we can definitely do the verbal call out tonight for tomorrow and another one tomorrow as a reminder and the same for Friday's testing.

647
00:58:15,668 --> 00:58:18,490
So we can definitely do that.

648
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:21,792
In terms of our goal is to get 100%.

649
00:58:22,673 --> 00:58:25,956
We don't quite yet have 100% as the forms were coming in,

650
00:58:28,736 --> 00:58:34,679
The form is a very simple form, the consent forms that the students would need to bring with them.

651
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:38,761
That form is a very simple form.

652
00:58:39,341 --> 00:58:41,022
You just need to provide an email.

653
00:58:41,512 --> 00:58:45,934
so that the results can go to that email and emergency contact.

654
00:58:46,554 --> 00:58:53,696
But once that's completed and they come in, it's a very, very quick, painless process.

655
00:58:54,297 --> 00:59:04,780
So that was part of why I think some people had a lot of anxiety and worry that it was the very painful test and it's not painful at all.

656
00:59:05,501 --> 00:59:08,082
And the seniors, of course, they're old enough

657
00:59:09,102 --> 00:59:13,784
you know, they'll be able to self-administer and it's a very accurate test.

658
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:15,705
So we are hoping to get 100%.

659
00:59:16,746 --> 00:59:23,429
I just, again, like you said, maybe if someone's phone number changed or

660
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:27,592
I don't know if the family email might have changed.

661
00:59:28,093 --> 00:59:47,772
So I'm not sure how close we will be able to get, but by Wednesday, we should have an idea of how many tests were given and the results, and we will plan accordingly or move accordingly from the data that we receive.

662
00:59:48,570 --> 00:59:56,293
Thank you and as a follow-up update to that, can you let school committee members know what the response was for the testing?

663
00:59:56,773 --> 01:00:07,418
So just so that we have an idea, number one, and then number two, if there's a student or a family that has difficulty because of transportation, do we have any options?

664
01:00:07,998 --> 01:00:16,481
So for example, a student that just, their family does not have transportation and maybe public transportation is not an option, I don't know.

665
01:00:16,501 --> 01:00:17,782
I'm just thinking about those sort of,

666
01:00:18,402 --> 01:00:22,285
outliers that might need assistance.

667
01:00:22,325 --> 01:00:28,890
I know that there are groups certainly in Medford and I know that there are likely people, you know, that are willing to, you know, volunteer.

668
01:00:29,869 --> 01:00:32,170
to help with transportation if needed.

669
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:43,056
So I just want us to, I'm wondering if there's any opportunity to address that for our students, either in the robocall or for folks that might need assistance getting to the school.

670
01:00:43,116 --> 01:00:56,183
Because again, I think Friday's a little bit different because people can plan ahead, but for tomorrow, if people are working and there's a senior who doesn't drive and maybe doesn't have access, how are we thinking about them?

671
01:00:58,654 --> 01:01:20,166
I would say if we, with tomorrow being Tuesday, I know that Mr. DeLeva has been sending communications to let the seniors know, but I don't have that information on, you know, is it 10 students that have difficulty?

672
01:01:20,246 --> 01:01:25,849
Is it like a manageable number or is it a number that is, you know,

673
01:01:27,163 --> 01:01:28,123
a significant number.

674
01:01:29,743 --> 01:01:34,984
I think everyone understands the importance of keeping the entire community safe.

675
01:01:35,565 --> 01:01:53,708
And so it's critically, critically important for our seniors, as we're going to be having significantly larger numbers of students come back, for them to try their best to come to school to participate in the testing, because Tuesday is the only option.

676
01:01:55,468 --> 01:01:57,449
that we do have for Thursday's start.

677
01:01:57,970 --> 01:02:15,902
So I would suggest that they reach out to Mr. DeLeva, send an email, try to communicate to us so we could see if there's something else that we could do for the students that might not be able to get to the high school for testing.

678
01:02:16,544 --> 01:02:17,405
Thank you, Superintendent.

679
01:02:17,445 --> 01:02:31,456
May I respectfully request that that's included in the robocall, so that if there's translation of the robocall, what have you, that people are all getting this information, so that it's a resource so that folks do know where they can go if there's an issue.

680
01:02:32,197 --> 01:02:32,477
Okay.

681
01:02:32,858 --> 01:02:33,278
Thank you.

682
01:02:33,738 --> 01:02:34,259
You're welcome.

683
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:36,561
Thank you.

684
01:02:36,581 --> 01:02:38,843
Mayor?

685
01:02:39,023 --> 01:02:39,403
Rosa?

686
01:02:40,284 --> 01:02:43,627
Yes, there's another email, and it feels appropriate right now.

687
01:02:44,718 --> 01:02:54,202
It's from Irina Shumway, Walgreens Street, and she is asking, can we please get an update for return to school for other grades at the high school, if that's available?

688
01:02:56,843 --> 01:03:05,307
I think you mentioned that, Madam Superintendent, but if you wanna just reiterate the official dates for the students?

689
01:03:06,447 --> 01:03:07,328
For the other grades.

690
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:12,022
So the, oh, the other grades at the high school you're saying.

691
01:03:12,782 --> 01:03:18,365
So the other grades at the high school we would be staggering them in in the new year so that would be in January.

692
01:03:18,926 --> 01:03:26,250
So, with, with the calendar, the seniors coming in on the, the 10th and the 14th.

693
01:03:28,357 --> 01:03:36,944
The seniors will be in school because the following week, the 21st and 22nd, Wednesday is a non-instructional day.

694
01:03:37,444 --> 01:03:47,252
So it ends up cohort C will have two days, this week and the following week.

695
01:03:47,692 --> 01:03:51,095
Cohort B will have the 14th and the 15th.

696
01:03:52,167 --> 01:03:53,888
and the 21st and the 22nd.

697
01:03:54,308 --> 01:04:04,514
So for the new year, so we have not disclosed what the dates are, but the continued staggered hybrid would be in the new year.

698
01:04:06,775 --> 01:04:11,878
As we continue to get everything lined up at the high school, it would be early January

699
01:04:12,458 --> 01:04:19,700
for 11th grade to come and then 10th and 9th grades to come to the high school.

700
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:30,863
So we will definitely give additional information in our weekly communications as we know the spaces are available.

701
01:04:32,624 --> 01:04:33,444
Great, thank you.

702
01:04:36,044 --> 01:04:41,106
Next up, we have a number two COVID-19 public health update and testing update report, Ms.

703
01:04:41,146 --> 01:04:41,606
Toni Ray.

704
01:04:46,312 --> 01:04:47,153
Good evening.

705
01:04:47,833 --> 01:04:53,857
I'm going to be providing some information from Marianne O'Connor, who was not able to be here tonight.

706
01:04:55,578 --> 01:05:01,702
So within the city, we are averaging 51 positive COVID cases a day.

707
01:05:01,722 --> 01:05:05,684
Our percent positivity rate is 1.42, and our incidence rate is 29.9%.

708
01:05:06,505 --> 01:05:07,245
And that is increasing

709
01:05:15,215 --> 01:05:19,599
in respect to and also in respect with what the state, the activity around the state.

710
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:26,444
What we know is that most of this is community transmission.

711
01:05:26,624 --> 01:05:28,606
It is not transmission in the school.

712
01:05:31,308 --> 01:05:37,433
And that has been due to Thanksgiving and holiday and community activities.

713
01:05:39,457 --> 01:05:56,207
Here at the school, I'd like to acknowledge the firefighters who came and helped us with the testing last week, as well as Dr. Patrick Sabia, our school physician, who came and suited up at the Roberts Elementary School and helped us swab students.

714
01:05:57,128 --> 01:06:07,234
And also the school nurses for their unwavering support in providing contact tracing and COVID testing layered on top of their normal duties.

715
01:06:09,043 --> 01:06:14,045
So at school, we are moving our testing to twice a week.

716
01:06:14,585 --> 01:06:19,506
Students will be tested once a week and twice a week testing is available for the staff.

717
01:06:20,427 --> 01:06:30,750
This past week's testing, we found a total of seven positive cases that were contact traced back to the holiday activities.

718
01:06:32,630 --> 01:06:37,752
We know we are providing layers of protection for our school community staff and staff.

719
01:06:38,808 --> 01:07:00,208
the mitigation strategies of face masks, face shields, desk shields, and social distancing, our alpha med screening, our bi-weekly testing, and upcoming, which we'll talk about later, will be our BinaxNOW point of care testing.

720
01:07:02,072 --> 01:07:11,434
We have been able to provide early identification and quarantine of both positive cases and close contacts.

721
01:07:12,095 --> 01:07:14,455
It has prevented the in-school transmission.

722
01:07:14,475 --> 01:07:21,837
And since September, we have had no in-school transmission that has been discovered through contact tracing.

723
01:07:24,412 --> 01:07:32,237
As you see on your screen, these are the numbers we've been following, the data of positive cases.

724
01:07:32,997 --> 01:07:42,143
Again, it is reflective of the activity that has been seen in the greater Boston area and including our community.

725
01:07:51,989 --> 01:07:52,849
Thank you, Ms.

726
01:07:52,929 --> 01:07:53,190
Wray.

727
01:07:53,550 --> 01:07:53,910
Thank you.

728
01:08:03,075 --> 01:08:03,315
Mayor.

729
01:08:04,095 --> 01:08:04,816
Member Rousseau.

730
01:08:06,096 --> 01:08:06,416
Thank you.

731
01:08:06,497 --> 01:08:07,357
Thank you for the report.

732
01:08:08,998 --> 01:08:09,178
Ms.

733
01:08:09,198 --> 01:08:17,381
Wray, how many close contacts, are we keeping track of how many close contacts we have identified for each positive?

734
01:08:20,303 --> 01:08:21,143
Yes, we do.

735
01:08:21,163 --> 01:08:30,167
I don't have that information at my fingertips right now, but I can pull that up.

736
01:08:31,186 --> 01:08:31,486
Thank you.

737
01:08:31,506 --> 01:08:33,187
That would be excellent to have.

738
01:08:34,087 --> 01:08:44,089
And I guess my sort of corollary question there is, are any of our positives ever having a close contact count of zero?

739
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:45,930
Yes.

740
01:08:47,530 --> 01:08:53,052
That they've been into a building and we're saying that the close contacts is zero?

741
01:08:53,672 --> 01:08:53,852
Yes.

742
01:08:55,939 --> 01:09:03,595
And that speaks to the mitigation efforts that the teachers are providing in the classroom.

743
01:09:05,766 --> 01:09:07,867
And we've had some very creative teachers.

744
01:09:09,608 --> 01:09:27,116
At one of the schools, teachers report that in order to maintain the distancing, when they go to help students with specific parts of their lessons, they're using a pointer so that they can maintain the distance and yet point on the student's paper to the area that they wanna discuss with the student.

745
01:09:28,057 --> 01:09:35,280
I thought that was a very creative way of maintaining distance, but also providing extra support to the student.

746
01:09:37,150 --> 01:09:37,550
Thank you.

747
01:09:38,251 --> 01:09:42,855
When you do get those numbers, could you get them by grade level?

748
01:09:42,895 --> 01:09:56,305
I'm just having a hard time imagining, you know, a kindergartener, a first grade teacher having zero close contacts, unless kindergartners and first graders are different than when I was that young.

749
01:09:58,247 --> 01:10:01,390
So, I mean, it would just be helpful to not just have like how many,

750
01:10:02,152 --> 01:10:09,714
of our how many close contacts, but for the ones that have zero close contacts in particular, I'd like to know more.

751
01:10:09,734 --> 01:10:24,317
I mean, I feel like that requires a level of adherence that sounds more like a surgical suite than it does in elementary school.

752
01:10:24,417 --> 01:10:28,858
So I'm a little surprised that there's zero for anybody.

753
01:10:30,223 --> 01:10:31,644
So if you can provide that, that would be great.

754
01:10:31,684 --> 01:10:38,908
And then my other question is, so cohort A students that are, sorry.

755
01:10:41,006 --> 01:10:41,987
Did you want to?

756
01:10:42,047 --> 01:10:42,807
No, no, go ahead.

757
01:10:43,528 --> 01:10:44,188
Sorry.

758
01:10:44,408 --> 01:10:44,749
That's okay.

759
01:10:45,129 --> 01:10:55,435
The cohort A students are, of course, mixing with the cohort B and the cohort C students, because that's the way it works.

760
01:10:55,796 --> 01:11:01,900
So when a cohort A student is positive, are we contact tracing to both cohort B and C?

761
01:11:03,565 --> 01:11:03,985
We are.

762
01:11:04,585 --> 01:11:16,509
We're contact tracing everywhere within the school environment, including the bus, lunchroom, or other specials class and other days of attendance.

763
01:11:16,709 --> 01:11:16,949
Yes.

764
01:11:17,689 --> 01:11:17,949
Thank you.

765
01:11:18,249 --> 01:11:20,370
And then that makes sense.

766
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:21,650
I was just confirming.

767
01:11:22,450 --> 01:11:25,471
And then my other question was around our protocols on cleaning.

768
01:11:27,572 --> 01:11:32,353
I don't remember every graphic detail, unfortunately, of our plans.

769
01:11:33,386 --> 01:11:38,334
Um, you know, we were going to clean between classes coming into a room.

770
01:11:39,877 --> 01:11:43,944
And so I'm just thinking, like, if a third grade goes to the art room.

771
01:11:45,146 --> 01:11:47,570
And then they go back to their room and then

772
01:11:48,090 --> 01:11:58,237
The next period arrives and that third grade another third grade class has to go to that same art room, I mean I think it's three or four or five minutes between.

773
01:11:59,739 --> 01:12:02,300
classes, how is the classroom getting cleaned.

774
01:12:03,721 --> 01:12:05,703
Between groups of students.

775
01:12:09,343 --> 01:12:12,664
John McLaughlin and his custodians have the foggers available.

776
01:12:12,764 --> 01:12:17,645
There's also spray cleaning solutions and paper towels.

777
01:12:17,745 --> 01:12:22,246
We've bought alcohol wipes for technology devices.

778
01:12:23,466 --> 01:12:29,088
And we really encourage teachers and students to be washing their hands.

779
01:12:29,788 --> 01:12:34,369
Soap and water is preferred, but if soap and water is not available,

780
01:12:35,869 --> 01:12:39,291
we have added additional hand sanitizer to the buildings.

781
01:12:40,792 --> 01:12:46,534
And that's something John McLaughlin would be able to address their cleaning schedules far better than I could.

782
01:12:48,616 --> 01:12:49,116
Mr. Murphy.

783
01:12:49,136 --> 01:12:50,256
Thank you.

784
01:12:51,297 --> 01:12:58,981
There are additional rounds of sanitation that are taking place between classes and when classrooms are vacated.

785
01:12:59,121 --> 01:13:03,263
And that's a norm that you'll see in each school community.

786
01:13:03,825 --> 01:13:19,058
There are instances, particularly at the secondary level, where the exchange of classes is so rapid that there isn't a full fogging of that class, but we try to minimize that as much as possible to be able to meet all the protocols that Ms.

787
01:13:19,078 --> 01:13:21,220
Ray was just speaking to.

788
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:25,063
I think that

789
01:13:25,934 --> 01:13:32,618
The general framework that was developed with regard to the frequency of the fogging is being adhered to.

790
01:13:33,699 --> 01:13:52,111
There may be some instances in which it's not realistic to have the amount of fogging and also have the time for the substance that's being used, which is a non-toxic substance, as we've spoken about before, to settle in and not

791
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:57,321
generally you don't want to be using it while there are actually people in the room.

792
01:13:57,402 --> 01:14:01,684
So it's a narrow window of time in many instances.

793
01:14:05,827 --> 01:14:06,587
Thank you, Ms.

794
01:14:06,607 --> 01:14:06,887
Murphy.

795
01:14:07,128 --> 01:14:11,070
If I may just ask for a quick elaboration, then I'm going to call on member Kretz.

796
01:14:12,831 --> 01:14:17,214
Tony, I know we have the teachers spoke earlier, very nervous.

797
01:14:17,274 --> 01:14:22,357
If you could explain some of the work you did over the weekend with the team with regards to

798
01:14:23,646 --> 01:14:39,733
how you contact trace and how we also are being extra cautious when it comes to especially the lower grades, even if it's questionable, how we handle that this weekend, just to give some reassurance to those who are watching, those sending their kids to school, and obviously those that are teaching our students.

799
01:14:40,573 --> 01:14:47,536
Okay, so this weekend we centered our contact tracing around seven positive cases.

800
01:14:48,616 --> 01:14:54,865
Um, the contact tracing phone calls were done by four different nurses.

801
01:14:55,266 --> 01:14:59,372
Um, uh, in addition to myself, um,

802
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:11,274
Contact tracing interviews do take time, and we had some completed by the middle, starting in the morning by about 8.30.

803
01:15:12,034 --> 01:15:14,157
We had some completed early in the afternoon.

804
01:15:14,617 --> 01:15:17,220
Others continued through the later afternoon.

805
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:29,176
Upon obtaining our information, I collaborated with the assistant superintendents to share data.

806
01:15:29,876 --> 01:15:44,184
We also had a team meeting that Mayor Blanco-Coyne was on, the superintendent, and we discussed the health metrics and how our data fit into the health metrics.

807
01:15:46,192 --> 01:15:55,117
We examined all the options within the framework of the health metrics and made our appropriate decisions.

808
01:15:56,338 --> 01:16:00,220
All families were notified though early in the day by the school nurses.

809
01:16:02,001 --> 01:16:02,681
Thank you very much.

810
01:16:02,942 --> 01:16:03,462
Member Kretz?

811
01:16:06,727 --> 01:16:07,327
Thank you very much.

812
01:16:07,387 --> 01:16:09,268
Thank you very much for the update, Ms.

813
01:16:09,308 --> 01:16:09,528
Ray.

814
01:16:10,068 --> 01:16:10,948
I just had a quick question.

815
01:16:11,008 --> 01:16:15,109
It was follow up to the response that you gave to Mr. Russo.

816
01:16:16,230 --> 01:16:28,673
When you do the contact tracing, does it also, you mentioned the bus, the lunch, cafeteria, does it include, when they're out at recess, does that incorporate the contact tracing as well?

817
01:16:30,084 --> 01:16:37,707
We do ask the teachers about the activities of the classroom, including recess.

818
01:16:37,827 --> 01:16:47,870
Recess poses a little bit different of a situation because the students are outside, but we do take all of that into consideration.

819
01:16:49,190 --> 01:16:56,593
We are interested in who the positive child has contact with and is palling around with.

820
01:17:00,182 --> 01:17:11,012
I know I got just a couple of, you know, just brief messages, just asking once again, and I looked it up, and could you define what a close contact is?

821
01:17:11,452 --> 01:17:17,037
Maybe if you could, you know, define what a close contact is again this evening, just as a refresher?

822
01:17:17,378 --> 01:17:18,178
Would you mind doing that?

823
01:17:18,439 --> 01:17:18,799
Thank you.

824
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:40,824
So a close contact defined by the Department of Public Health is somebody who has cared for a COVID positive person, or those who have been within six feet for greater than 15 minutes over the course, in our instance, would be over the course of the school day.

825
01:17:46,225 --> 01:17:47,065
Thank you very much.

826
01:17:47,085 --> 01:17:47,285
Thank you.

827
01:17:47,305 --> 01:17:47,745
Member Vander Kloot?

828
01:17:50,447 --> 01:17:51,068
Yes, thank you.

829
01:17:51,648 --> 01:18:02,138
I just want to be clear on making sure that I understand the teacher's statement and the information that, Tony, you're supplying.

830
01:18:03,059 --> 01:18:09,565
Up to this point, my understanding was that there was only one in-school transmission.

831
01:18:11,627 --> 01:18:13,329
Do we have any more than that at this point?

832
01:18:13,950 --> 01:18:14,730
No, we do not.

833
01:18:15,549 --> 01:18:17,870
We only had one.

834
01:18:18,190 --> 01:18:21,292
All of the cases have been from community transmission.

835
01:18:25,734 --> 01:18:34,299
But we've heard that there's a large number of teachers out at the Roberts in particular.

836
01:18:34,779 --> 01:18:37,400
That's because they are quarantining?

837
01:18:38,101 --> 01:18:38,341
Yes.

838
01:18:39,141 --> 01:18:39,261
Yes.

839
01:18:39,301 --> 01:18:42,143
So they were determined to be close contacts.

840
01:18:42,830 --> 01:18:44,211
to a positive case.

841
01:18:45,112 --> 01:19:00,942
And some classrooms, because of the nature of having a teacher and maybe two paras, you're increasing the number of staff that is exposed, whether it be to a student or a staff member.

842
01:19:01,753 --> 01:19:07,936
So a positive case that was in school, is that correct?

843
01:19:08,096 --> 01:19:09,076
Yes, that came to schools.

844
01:19:09,136 --> 01:19:15,819
Because remember, some of our identification of positive cases has been through our school testing.

845
01:19:16,879 --> 01:19:25,823
People are feeling minimally ill and are coming to work, or they're asymptomatic and they're coming to work, and we are picking them up with our school testing.

846
01:19:27,565 --> 01:19:29,667
we are not seeing in-school transmission.

847
01:19:30,927 --> 01:19:48,940
If I understand it correctly, what you're saying is that because of the testing and our ability to pick up cases, we are getting to those students and faculty members before they've actually become positive.

848
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:49,781
Is that correct?

849
01:19:50,241 --> 01:19:55,963
No, we're getting to them before they're feeling illness, many of them illness symptoms.

850
01:19:55,983 --> 01:20:02,446
They may be positive, but they may not be feeling very ill where they end up deciding to stay home.

851
01:20:02,566 --> 01:20:05,987
So we're picking them up very early in their course.

852
01:20:06,367 --> 01:20:06,567
Right.

853
01:20:06,968 --> 01:20:16,615
I mean, I certainly understand the, you know, when all of a sudden we hear that there's a greater number of teachers who are on quarantine.

854
01:20:17,015 --> 01:20:18,196
I certainly understand.

855
01:20:18,256 --> 01:20:30,146
And I think all of us feel this right now, this anxiety as we see the case number get higher and higher throughout not only Massachusetts, but the country.

856
01:20:30,746 --> 01:20:32,508
And, you know, sort of

857
01:20:33,268 --> 01:20:34,589
it's very unsettling.

858
01:20:35,149 --> 01:20:40,192
But what you're saying is so far the data says that we're doing okay.

859
01:20:41,292 --> 01:20:53,518
Yes, and when we're putting people out to quarantine, we are not seeing positive cases within that quarantined group.

860
01:20:54,751 --> 01:20:55,851
at any rate.

861
01:20:56,292 --> 01:21:05,438
So we're feeling like we're really identifying people, we're keeping them out when they've been exposed, and that has helped prevent positive illness.

862
01:21:06,136 --> 01:21:14,885
Now, by no means am I dismissing the anxiety attached to being told you should quarantine or whatever.

863
01:21:14,945 --> 01:21:27,538
I mean, I certainly understand that that is an important piece of what our staff and teachers are conveying to us is that they're nervous about it.

864
01:21:28,306 --> 01:21:39,636
But what you're saying right now is there's really been no change in the data, which would suggest that we need to do something different in terms of having students come to school.

865
01:21:39,696 --> 01:21:40,397
Is that correct?

866
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:52,469
So what I'm saying is we have looked at every situation in the case of, you know, if we feel like we need to close a classroom, we have done that.

867
01:21:54,451 --> 01:21:57,934
But overall, our schools are very safe.

868
01:21:58,034 --> 01:22:01,757
We are not seeing the transmission within the school buildings.

869
01:22:03,933 --> 01:22:06,234
Transmission has been community-based.

870
01:22:06,735 --> 01:22:10,278
People gathered together for the Thanksgiving holiday.

871
01:22:10,558 --> 01:22:11,639
People traveled.

872
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:18,164
This was all, you know, in opposition to what the Department of Public Health recommendations were.

873
01:22:18,585 --> 01:22:27,192
And now, a week later, we are seeing the results of those activities, of people being together within their household,

874
01:22:29,258 --> 01:22:33,662
come in company of people who are not, they're not living with in their home.

875
01:22:34,363 --> 01:22:37,325
And that's when we get the community spread.

876
01:22:39,027 --> 01:22:42,690
I guess then the next question really goes to the superintendent.

877
01:22:43,931 --> 01:22:51,137
When we see the number of staff getting higher because they're on quarantine, do we have enough?

878
01:22:52,118 --> 01:22:55,261
And I know that there's been an incredible effort

879
01:22:56,135 --> 01:23:03,962
to cover classes and that the administrative people and others have just really stepped up and covered.

880
01:23:04,402 --> 01:23:12,049
But when we see what's going on at the Roberts right now with a certain level of teachers being out, are we able to cover the classrooms?

881
01:23:12,930 --> 01:23:13,790
Is it still working?

882
01:23:14,611 --> 01:23:19,233
Yes, so I did speak with Principal Johnson today as well.

883
01:23:19,693 --> 01:23:29,298
And the number of staff that is quarantining right now, although the number is high, we're not talking total homerooms.

884
01:23:29,958 --> 01:23:36,901
So we do have staff in different roles, different supporting roles.

885
01:23:36,961 --> 01:23:42,224
So some people may be an enrichment or supplemental teacher.

886
01:23:43,705 --> 01:23:52,270
But in terms of total homeroom teachers right now that are quarantined, we had five out.

887
01:23:53,131 --> 01:23:55,132
One will be back on Thursday.

888
01:23:55,752 --> 01:23:58,214
Another one is coming back on Friday.

889
01:23:58,234 --> 01:24:02,757
So there is a lot of management that's happening.

890
01:24:02,817 --> 01:24:06,139
I think one of the challenges that happened today at

891
01:24:09,291 --> 01:24:23,962
at the school when I did speak with the principal was that they did have alternative coverage, but natural things happen where someone may just, you know, wake up with a migraine and not feel well in the morning.

892
01:24:24,202 --> 01:24:31,668
And so there was an additional, you know, person who either requested an absent day or may have had a personal day.

893
01:24:33,149 --> 01:24:33,309
But

894
01:24:34,250 --> 01:24:40,312
In terms of right now, we are watching, we are closely watching the numbers of staff that are out.

895
01:24:40,672 --> 01:24:44,193
We're also paying attention to what roles.

896
01:24:45,833 --> 01:24:52,735
So at this point in time, there were a significant amount of adults that were not in the building today.

897
01:24:52,755 --> 01:24:59,937
I don't expect that number to be as high tomorrow.

898
01:25:01,687 --> 01:25:04,149
but we have to look at the entire school.

899
01:25:04,269 --> 01:25:15,596
There are 18 general education classrooms and the Roberts has five specialized classrooms.

900
01:25:16,196 --> 01:25:29,245
So for a total of 23 classrooms in the entire school homerooms, and of those 23, there were five homeroom based teachers

901
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:32,656
that we're not in.

902
01:25:32,736 --> 01:25:40,298
So it's not a number, we would love to see the number zero, but we are working with that number.

903
01:25:40,318 --> 01:25:56,781
So at this point in time, we take the questions and the concerns that were presented earlier, we do take it seriously, but we are working with the instructional leaders of the building and looking at the structure and looking at where are the homerooms.

904
01:25:57,401 --> 01:25:57,581
So,

905
01:25:58,561 --> 01:26:08,904
If, for example, you know, not that I want anyone to, you know, be out on quarantine but if an art teacher or wasn't in.

906
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:13,041
students can still participate in the instructional day.

907
01:26:13,061 --> 01:26:27,445
It's not ideal to not have the teacher not present, but it would not be a homeroom teacher if that makes sense in terms of how the school day functions and the instruction that students are receiving.

908
01:26:27,745 --> 01:26:33,747
So we're looking at all of those factors in terms of can the school run?

909
01:26:34,387 --> 01:26:37,168
And if in fact it were to be at a point where

910
01:26:38,248 --> 01:26:50,115
that wasn't able to happen, then we would definitely communicate with the school committee and communicate with the school community to let them know, this is the situation that we are in right now.

911
01:26:50,935 --> 01:26:55,758
This is the amount of staff that is quarantining or whatever the case may be.

912
01:26:56,378 --> 01:26:59,019
And we would look at other options at that point in time.

913
01:27:02,361 --> 01:27:02,741
Thank you.

914
01:27:03,062 --> 01:27:03,622
Member Kratz.

915
01:27:08,395 --> 01:27:10,256
I just had one more follow-up question.

916
01:27:11,016 --> 01:27:19,740
So if a person, you know, kind of thinks that they were a close contact, but they weren't contacted, what should that person do?

917
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:21,841
Should they get in touch with Ms.

918
01:27:21,901 --> 01:27:25,542
Ray or Marian O'Connor or the principal?

919
01:27:26,262 --> 01:27:28,723
How would that, how would something like that happen, work out?

920
01:27:29,164 --> 01:27:30,444
You would call Ms.

921
01:27:30,524 --> 01:27:37,507
Ray or the school nurse, or you always call the Board of Health, but do not contact your teacher

922
01:27:38,098 --> 01:27:41,800
call the school nurse or Ms.

923
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:42,021
Ray.

924
01:27:42,041 --> 01:27:43,762
Okay, thank you.

925
01:27:43,782 --> 01:27:49,706
Any questions?

926
01:27:50,146 --> 01:27:54,849
And I just wanna give a shout out to put this in perspective a little bit.

927
01:27:54,909 --> 01:28:05,356
I know nobody wants to see any cases among our staff or among our students, but the positive thing that we have here in Medford that a lot of communities don't have

928
01:28:05,735 --> 01:28:31,458
some of whom are fully remote, some are in the hybrid or week on, week off, like for instance, Reading, we are able to provide, even if it is just for the month of December so far, we are able to provide our students testing and we're able to catch these cases so that instead of being in the whole week, we catch them as soon as we can, since our students are getting tested every week and we're able

929
01:28:32,085 --> 01:28:35,387
It's just an extra layer of protection that we have here in Medford.

930
01:28:35,427 --> 01:28:42,693
And this could not be possible without the team that you're looking at as far as the administration of the school and the board of health.

931
01:28:43,293 --> 01:28:49,818
When Tufts and Broad and mayor's office and school admin got on a call and we

932
01:28:50,407 --> 01:28:52,328
said yes, this sounds like a great idea.

933
01:28:53,268 --> 01:29:04,311
When we got that follow-up email, how much staff and how much PPE this was going to take, I thought there is no way we can do this, but your school admin has really come together.

934
01:29:04,451 --> 01:29:07,912
We need an additional, I think Tony can correct me if I'm wrong, but

935
01:29:08,652 --> 01:29:16,315
22 personnel every Tuesday and every Friday to administer testing within each school, the proper and appropriate way.

936
01:29:16,735 --> 01:29:26,979
And to do that is really, for me, I wasn't involved in the PPE or the, I don't do the testing, but the school admin came together and made that happen with our board of health.

937
01:29:27,079 --> 01:29:29,720
And it's something that we have here in Medford.

938
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:36,502
I'm very proud of and very happy that we're able to keep our schools in session, even if it's two days a week,

939
01:29:36,918 --> 01:29:39,819
and keep our teachers as safe as possible, as well as our students.

940
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:40,900
So thank you, Tony.

941
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:45,302
I have also a quick announcement to add.

942
01:29:45,902 --> 01:29:51,385
We recently signed an affiliation agreement with Northeastern University School of Nursing.

943
01:29:51,685 --> 01:30:00,570
And come January, we will be providing them with a clinical placement site, and they will be providing us with 24 student nurses.

944
01:30:04,427 --> 01:30:06,368
six clinical instructors.

945
01:30:07,048 --> 01:30:24,033
So we're very appreciative of Northeastern's willingness to partner with us and also understand that we are providing them with an outstanding public health community practical experience for clinical.

946
01:30:24,493 --> 01:30:26,133
So that's very exciting.

947
01:30:26,153 --> 01:30:27,794
That's great.

948
01:30:27,834 --> 01:30:28,214
Thank you.

949
01:30:28,614 --> 01:30:29,074
Mr. Murphy?

950
01:30:29,674 --> 01:30:31,915
Mayor, I just wanted to add, I know you, I think,

951
01:30:32,201 --> 01:30:49,470
both you and the superintendent referenced the support we've received from Tufts University as part of this partnership, but I don't think we can adequately express our gratitude for the time and energy that the Tufts personnel have put into making this program a success.

952
01:30:49,630 --> 01:31:00,435
I mean, there are Tufts personnel and we sort of jokingly have said to them in the past that we don't want to thank them too much because we don't want their supervisors at Tufts to know

953
01:31:00,912 --> 01:31:19,344
just how much time they're spending supporting our work, but between Chris Sador and his staff, Karen and Alex, who essentially just moved into the Medford Bowick schools and helped us to stand up these testing programs and

954
01:31:20,942 --> 01:31:31,188
you know, as I said, Miss Ray could attest to this as well, but we're spending an enormous amount of time with them and it's valuable time that has made this this program a success so far.

955
01:31:31,248 --> 01:31:32,989
So we're grateful to them.

956
01:31:33,209 --> 01:31:43,235
And, you know, frankly, we'll be back on the phone with them right after this meeting, and then we'll be working with them throughout tomorrow and the rest of the week and hopefully for the foreseeable future.

957
01:31:44,956 --> 01:31:46,697
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

958
01:31:46,917 --> 01:31:47,357
Member Graham.

959
01:31:54,060 --> 01:31:54,700
There it is, sorry.

960
01:31:56,981 --> 01:32:02,443
I did want to say thank you to all the people that are working hard to make all of this testing available.

961
01:32:02,463 --> 01:32:14,547
I know that sort of the numbers make it feel ugly because the testing is revealing to us, you know, where these cases are at and but I think it's so important and it is important that we are

962
01:32:15,672 --> 01:32:21,815
identifying folks as early as we possibly can so that we can contain the spread.

963
01:32:21,955 --> 01:32:27,818
So I'm hopeful that we can find a way to continue this testing come January.

964
01:32:27,838 --> 01:32:39,344
So I know for right now, it's only December, but perhaps at the next meeting, we can talk about the real need for this to be able to continue and figure out how we find a way to do that.

965
01:32:40,124 --> 01:32:41,625
Because I think that's critically important

966
01:32:43,266 --> 01:32:45,467
think the vaccine news is good, but it's not great.

967
01:32:45,607 --> 01:32:49,728
So, um, we're going to need this just as much in January as we do right now.

968
01:32:49,748 --> 01:32:59,471
Um, the other thing I wanted to mention is that I popped out to the dashboard, um, and it has not been updated, especially, and in particular, um, section three.

969
01:33:00,491 --> 01:33:07,993
And the other thing that I was thinking about as I was listening to the teachers, um, earlier and to this conversation is that.

970
01:33:09,516 --> 01:33:17,919
there are clear, like there are differences between people who have tested positive and people who have been asked to quarantine because they are close contact.

971
01:33:18,699 --> 01:33:28,283
And the chart that Tony showed earlier tells us who tested positive, but it does not paint a picture at all of who is a close contact and who is having to quarantine.

972
01:33:29,583 --> 01:33:36,606
So I was going to ask that that close contact number quarantine be put on this chart

973
01:33:37,426 --> 01:33:45,595
spreadsheet, but perhaps maybe it belongs on the dashboard instead in the like school specific conditions.

974
01:33:46,056 --> 01:33:48,378
And maybe that is the appropriate place for it.

975
01:33:49,099 --> 01:33:55,346
I don't actually care where it goes, but I do think it's critically important that it goes somewhere and that it's maintained on a weekly basis.

976
01:33:55,986 --> 01:34:07,720
Along with this spreadsheet so just last night somebody was asking where they could find the spreadsheet and was it updated and I do think the the spreadsheet should be posted on a weekly basis at minimum on our website.

977
01:34:09,706 --> 01:34:17,134
so that people can find it and that section three of the dashboard, which we approved last week, be maintained as well.

978
01:34:17,254 --> 01:34:31,589
So I think if we can get to that level of specificity with some of the data that we are sharing, I think it will help the community lend clarity because I will admit that as I listened to all of

979
01:34:32,190 --> 01:34:49,978
this information I was like one person said 15 and one person said 10 and then the same person said seven and so which number is it and maybe all of those numbers are true in some regard, but it's very very difficult to sort of rationalize all of that as it's being spoken so.

980
01:34:51,238 --> 01:35:02,385
Um, I think for those who aren't tuning into this meeting on a regular basis and for people who just on a regular basis really want to know where the school community is at so they can make decisions for their families.

981
01:35:03,126 --> 01:35:17,434
Um, I, I think that this information needs to be publicly available and I can put that in a motion if you would like, but, um, and my colleagues can vote on it, but I would like to see us move forward with that data on a weekly basis.

982
01:35:18,515 --> 01:35:18,735
Sure.

983
01:35:18,795 --> 01:35:20,016
Thank you, miss Ray.

984
01:35:24,733 --> 01:35:27,215
Thank you, Jenny, for your thoughts.

985
01:35:27,555 --> 01:35:37,763
I do want to mention that the quarantine list will not necessarily reflect only those who have been quarantined as close contacts within school.

986
01:35:38,504 --> 01:35:48,532
A majority of those people that are quarantined are quarantined because of a close contact within their own household or within their community.

987
01:35:48,932 --> 01:35:51,454
So there is a blurring of that.

988
01:35:53,095 --> 01:36:09,240
Yeah, I am more interested in, I guess, and I'm open to feedback on this, but I am more interested in those folks who would normally come to our school buildings who are not coming to the school buildings because they have been identified as a close contact for some reason or another.

989
01:36:09,260 --> 01:36:12,241
How many of those are there?

990
01:36:13,101 --> 01:36:14,382
So if there are 10 staff

991
01:36:15,965 --> 01:36:22,387
who have been identified in some capacity as a close contact and are being asked to quarantine, I wanna see the number 10.

992
01:36:23,447 --> 01:36:25,588
So you wanna see within the school environment.

993
01:36:25,808 --> 01:36:26,228
Correct.

994
01:36:26,748 --> 01:36:30,209
Okay, that's a whole different piece of information.

995
01:36:30,229 --> 01:36:30,890
Okay.

996
01:36:31,690 --> 01:36:31,910
Yeah.

997
01:36:33,312 --> 01:36:45,202
And again, I think, you know, I've had several people reach out to me who their children are going to school and they like going to school and they are happy about going to school.

998
01:36:45,722 --> 01:36:50,366
But as parents, we often make decisions that our kids may or may not love, right?

999
01:36:50,847 --> 01:36:56,511
And we do that with whatever information the best that we have and we do, you know, we do what we can.

1000
01:36:56,571 --> 01:37:00,555
And so this, you know, there's, there were several parents last night in particular who were saying,

1001
01:37:01,055 --> 01:37:07,339
where's the data so I can go look at it so I can determine whether I feel like this still makes sense for my family.

1002
01:37:08,439 --> 01:37:10,040
And I couldn't point them anywhere.

1003
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:16,124
So I would like to be able to say that this stuff is available somewhere on a regular basis.

1004
01:37:25,609 --> 01:37:28,691
Mayor, we have several emails if everybody else has done.

1005
01:37:33,478 --> 01:37:36,038
I don't know that there's a need for a motion.

1006
01:37:36,058 --> 01:37:41,580
I think it's clear what the request is, and provided that it's data that we can, um.

1007
01:37:42,220 --> 01:37:42,880
We can collect.

1008
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:46,001
I think we want to publish as much data and be as transparent as possible.

1009
01:37:46,661 --> 01:37:52,262
The one caveat I wanted to add to that I was thinking as Mr Graham was referencing what, um.

1010
01:37:53,151 --> 01:38:22,037
various parents or other constituents have asked about and sort of looking to see what data can they look at in order to draw conclusions for their own family and the rapidity with which this data is coming in and changing and the legitimate limitations on the district's capacity is putting us in a position frequently I find

1011
01:38:22,777 --> 01:38:36,305
where there's capacity to either respond to the situation on the ground to make sure that the people that need the information have it and can make appropriate decisions based on that for safety purposes.

1012
01:38:37,346 --> 01:38:41,909
And then we report and publish as quickly as possible.

1013
01:38:42,429 --> 01:38:52,135
So I don't think there'll be any hesitancy on our part to collect because we need to and publish information, but the prioritization

1014
01:38:53,145 --> 01:39:00,090
and I know the committee would agree, has to be on making sure that we're responding to situations and communicating to those directly affected.

1015
01:39:00,650 --> 01:39:21,545
And the volume being what it's been in recent weeks, coupled with the challenge of just operating the district and making sure that there's coverage in each school where it needs to be, and then the execution of the testing program that we have, is going to put us in a position where

1016
01:39:22,015 --> 01:39:34,848
I don't want families to think that any of this information is guaranteed to be all of the information they need to draw a conclusion with regard to their family.

1017
01:39:35,229 --> 01:39:45,139
It may well be the case that some metrics or some spreadsheets aren't updated until a reasonable period of time in which we know we have all the information and we know what the universe of

1018
01:39:45,697 --> 01:39:53,623
of data is, and we've been able to fulfill all of the other responsibilities that are associated with the events that lead to that data.

1019
01:39:54,063 --> 01:40:12,477
So I think the message should be, while we will publish everything we have and will continue to be as transparent as we have, as we can be, if you are a close contact, if you need to take action to keep your child and your family safe with regard to quarantining, isolating, or what have you, you'll be called

1020
01:40:12,873 --> 01:40:16,737
by the Board of Health or their representatives, likely in the Health Services Department.

1021
01:40:17,217 --> 01:40:26,066
And all of the other information that is published via the website or anywhere else will be useful so people that can sort of understand the global situation.

1022
01:40:26,627 --> 01:40:32,893
But in terms of decisions within households, that's information that we have to continue to

1023
01:40:33,914 --> 01:40:48,662
on a case-by-case basis, make those communications known, because we just do not have the capacity to update all of the various data streams in real time, such that it can be reliable for parents to make those types of decisions.

1024
01:40:48,682 --> 01:40:59,707
So I know that's a convoluted way of saying that we're going to continue to publish and be as transparent as possible, but that publishing responsibility will always be secondary

1025
01:41:00,117 --> 01:41:10,441
to our responsibility to make sure that the people within the school that are affected by potential exposure are being notified with the information that they need as a family or as a parent.

1026
01:41:12,342 --> 01:41:16,263
So I think I'm just trying to understand what that tactically means.

1027
01:41:16,703 --> 01:41:22,445
So does that mean we can commit to publishing once a week, which we've, by the way, already done?

1028
01:41:24,277 --> 01:41:32,139
Does that, I mean, I think ideally we would be able to publish more than one time a week, maybe twice since we have two cohorts that are coming and going.

1029
01:41:33,619 --> 01:41:48,942
If that's not reasonable, I both understand and am completely frustrated that we are so thin as a district that we can't provide this kind of information to families.

1030
01:41:49,042 --> 01:41:51,123
So I don't think any of us

1031
01:41:52,043 --> 01:42:06,810
wants to or is or can assume that every family has the same risk situation that leads them to say I have complete trust I'm just going to let somebody else take the wheel and they'll call me if I need to do something.

1032
01:42:07,410 --> 01:42:08,511
Not every family

1033
01:42:09,789 --> 01:42:12,451
is in that position and not every family wants to be.

1034
01:42:12,471 --> 01:42:26,723
And I think that as challenging as this is, certainly those getting calls need to do what we're asking them to do, but there's a whole slew of people who hear this swirl and don't know what to make of it.

1035
01:42:27,024 --> 01:42:31,768
And I would rather see us commit to publishing data

1036
01:42:32,837 --> 01:42:51,563
couple times a week, then getting to the point, which I think is coming, where the administration gets bogged down with questions from individual parents, how many, how many, how much, how many, that is going to actually take more time than if we just said, we're going to publish this data twice a week, here's where you can find it, go out and look and it'll be there.

1037
01:42:53,043 --> 01:42:56,786
because I think that's taxing on our system as well.

1038
01:42:57,346 --> 01:43:05,612
So I'm trying to avoid that, but I just want people to be able to clearly say to people, like, when can they reasonably expect to see this stuff?

1039
01:43:06,032 --> 01:43:07,173
So may I respond?

1040
01:43:09,635 --> 01:43:10,435
Of course, Mr. Murphy.

1041
01:43:10,755 --> 01:43:11,176
Thank you, Mayor.

1042
01:43:11,736 --> 01:43:14,258
I think that's, again, totally reasonable point.

1043
01:43:14,538 --> 01:43:20,322
I think that, and my concern is that, and I think it's a shared one,

1044
01:43:21,242 --> 01:43:27,667
We all want to publish the information, but we want to publish the information in a fashion that can be reliable, right?

1045
01:43:28,307 --> 01:43:38,514
And I think the weekly publication that we're currently adhering to, obviously the more data that we need to collect and process, the more challenging that gets.

1046
01:43:39,094 --> 01:43:41,796
I think, and I'll defer to Ms.

1047
01:43:41,836 --> 01:43:49,662
Wright, but I would also invite our team to maybe collaborate and discuss this before we stake out a position with regard to weekly versus

1048
01:43:50,378 --> 01:43:53,380
twice a week weekly because I think I think that requires some conversation.

1049
01:43:54,101 --> 01:44:05,729
I think the if the northeastern the northeastern agreement which is now in place, which contemplates the continuation of the expanded testing, which, again, we're still

1050
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:24,027
details that have to be worked out there, major ones, including the funding, but we're optimistic that we're gonna get to a place where the reason we're building our testing muscle right now, the reason we're pushing our capacity is so that we're in a place to be able to do this as efficiently as possible going forward.

1051
01:44:24,047 --> 01:44:32,831
And when that support comes in through that affiliation agreement, we will generally have more capacity to be able to respond.

1052
01:44:33,251 --> 01:44:35,392
And at that point, we may be able to commit

1053
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:40,123
a different publication schedule of some kind.

1054
01:44:40,443 --> 01:44:53,317
But even if and when that happens, the most accurate information will be the phone calls that get made through the Board of Health through the processes that the state and the city have developed.

1055
01:44:54,598 --> 01:44:55,519
I think Ms.

1056
01:44:55,539 --> 01:44:57,181
Graham's point is well taken that

1057
01:44:57,500 --> 01:45:07,325
we don't just wanna flood the switchboard with calls from families that are concerned because the information on the website doesn't appear to have been updated in the last 24 hours.

1058
01:45:07,926 --> 01:45:16,630
And I think that's fair, but I think we will have to one, look through other systems in terms of keeping people updated at the school building level.

1059
01:45:17,271 --> 01:45:25,555
And frankly, if there's people that are concerned because of the particular susceptibility that may be present within their home,

1060
01:45:25,938 --> 01:45:31,302
I think those families should be in constant contact with the school nurse.

1061
01:45:31,743 --> 01:45:36,947
And they shouldn't worry about the switchboard getting flooded, because we always have time to respond to families.

1062
01:45:37,287 --> 01:45:42,351
The school nursing staff, the school principals, and other building staff are doing it on a daily and hourly basis.

1063
01:45:42,491 --> 01:45:49,636
I am certain that somewhere in Medford right now, there's someone from one of our eight school communities speaking with a family.

1064
01:45:52,189 --> 01:45:58,835
primetime hours for that, but it's a guarantee that that's happening right now, whether it's via email, via phone, via text or what have you.

1065
01:45:59,215 --> 01:46:13,028
So they shouldn't hesitate to call and pose those questions because that is in many respects why our building staff are there, to be able to answer those questions, give them the most relevant and updated information for their family.

1066
01:46:13,388 --> 01:46:17,952
And then we will continue to publish the broader information for the community at large.

1067
01:46:18,639 --> 01:46:25,046
But those phone calls, nothing is going to replace those phone calls, I don't think, in this particular situation.

1068
01:46:26,587 --> 01:46:30,451
Yeah, and if I could make a suggestion, if we are going to stick with

1069
01:46:32,321 --> 01:46:43,185
publishing once a week, I might suggest that that publication happened on Monday because you're publishing those numbers to this group every other Monday anyway.

1070
01:46:43,205 --> 01:46:49,507
The original reason those numbers published on Thursday is because the state gave us data on Wednesday and

1071
01:46:50,427 --> 01:46:57,752
at the time we cared about what that data said as a marker for what we would do next and none of that applies anymore.

1072
01:46:57,812 --> 01:47:06,778
So the fact that the dashboard is published on Thursday is arbitrary and I would suggest that if you're going to publish once a week you do it on Monday because

1073
01:47:07,138 --> 01:47:14,620
there's multiple uses and you have, you know, the full testing that comes in from Thursday, Friday, that's totally up to you all.

1074
01:47:14,940 --> 01:47:17,601
I think publishing twice a week makes a lot of sense.

1075
01:47:18,921 --> 01:47:26,703
And if we have to wait to get to twice a week until Northeastern is on board, whatever that's all about, I think that's reasonable.

1076
01:47:26,783 --> 01:47:32,665
But I think in the meantime, we do need to commit to what we have already committed to, which is publishing on a weekly basis.

1077
01:47:32,745 --> 01:47:35,726
And I would like to see this other information added to that publication.

1078
01:47:36,058 --> 01:47:44,143
Yeah, if there's not a variable that I'm not thinking of, moving it to Monday, I can think of several reasons that that would be advantageous.

1079
01:47:44,243 --> 01:48:01,073
So that would make sense to me, but I think we'll, if it's okay with the committee, discuss this amongst our team over the next day or two, and then see how we can revise some of those systems to make sure the information is more readily accessible.

1080
01:48:02,014 --> 01:48:02,394
Thank you.

1081
01:48:02,935 --> 01:48:03,135
Ms.

1082
01:48:03,155 --> 01:48:03,455
Galluzzi.

1083
01:48:04,587 --> 01:48:24,270
Yeah, I just want to say I do have just a little bit of concern though in terms of the close contact information because there are there are in every building scenarios and more than one situation where the close contact information has nothing to do with Medford public schools.

1084
01:48:24,920 --> 01:48:28,183
and contact with a positive person within Medford public schools.

1085
01:48:28,804 --> 01:48:38,672
People are quarantining as well from being close contacts to family members at home, or in their hometown districts and that would skew the information that parents

1086
01:48:39,508 --> 01:48:42,369
you know, are gonna be going to look at to help make their decisions.

1087
01:48:42,409 --> 01:48:45,970
And so I'm a little concerned using the close contact information.

1088
01:48:46,390 --> 01:49:04,736
With that being said, I think that that's the difficulty right now in some of the, you know, concerns that people are bringing up with coverage issues, because that's the kind of umbrella or domino effect that is occurring right now, which the positive rates might be a little low, but the close coverages are a little high.

1089
01:49:04,957 --> 01:49:09,098
So I just needed to say that because the numbers won't be completely valid

1090
01:49:09,605 --> 01:49:14,228
unless we're just reporting on close contacts that are in relationship to Metro Public Schools.

1091
01:49:15,329 --> 01:49:26,376
Yeah, maybe the admin can put their heads together in the next couple of days and give us an email by the end of the week on how best to report this out, this data out to the community by Monday.

1092
01:49:27,737 --> 01:49:27,997
Yes.

1093
01:49:29,659 --> 01:49:30,179
That is fair.

1094
01:49:30,579 --> 01:49:30,799
Okay.

1095
01:49:30,959 --> 01:49:31,460
That is fair.

1096
01:49:31,980 --> 01:49:32,320
Thank you.

1097
01:49:32,541 --> 01:49:33,061
Member Rousseau?

1098
01:49:34,193 --> 01:49:34,514
Thank you.

1099
01:49:34,654 --> 01:49:38,801
I just wanted to respond briefly to miss Lucy's point.

1100
01:49:38,821 --> 01:49:42,087
I think there's like an elephant in the room and that is trust.

1101
01:49:43,527 --> 01:49:48,071
and it is not about whether I trust you all or the rest of the committee trusts you all.

1102
01:49:48,511 --> 01:49:53,074
It's about whether or not the individual families have any reason to trust us.

1103
01:49:53,895 --> 01:50:03,842
And the reason I'm so interested in close contact counts is that we trusted the state, well, we tried to, and then they just moved the goalposts.

1104
01:50:04,922 --> 01:50:08,365
Well, listen, we can move the goalposts on contact tracing too.

1105
01:50:09,195 --> 01:50:14,404
We can go from 10 people on average contact traced and being considered close contacts.

1106
01:50:14,805 --> 01:50:20,174
And this make it, if over time it becomes we only get one or two or zero is the normal.

1107
01:50:21,193 --> 01:50:23,754
for the number of close contacts, that's moving the goalposts.

1108
01:50:24,434 --> 01:50:33,258
So I think families and myself, I have kids and a family, I wanna know that these metrics are consistent.

1109
01:50:33,498 --> 01:50:49,484
I mean, if in September or October, the number of close contacts on average was six, and then in December it's four, and then in February it's two, I'm gonna say trust isn't really appropriate.

1110
01:50:51,057 --> 01:50:53,758
So the elephant in the room is trust.

1111
01:50:54,258 --> 01:51:00,320
All of this is based on trust because families can't go to school, we don't have cameras so we can all watch what's going on.

1112
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:07,582
And I know I want evidence that makes me think that the trust is deserved.

1113
01:51:07,702 --> 01:51:12,083
It isn't about whether anybody here is a good person or doing their job.

1114
01:51:13,104 --> 01:51:16,605
I think there is data that can be used to make

1115
01:51:17,728 --> 01:51:28,376
giving trust a rational thing, because the state and the federal government, they certainly had fallen flat on any reason to believe government should be trusted.

1116
01:51:28,616 --> 01:51:29,837
And we are government.

1117
01:51:29,917 --> 01:51:33,019
School systems, every employee of a school system is part of the government.

1118
01:51:33,619 --> 01:51:39,663
So I think it behooves us to care about trust explicitly.

1119
01:51:40,344 --> 01:51:43,686
And this, in my mind, is one way to make that happen.

1120
01:51:44,007 --> 01:51:46,068
So that's why I just wanted to point that out.

1121
01:51:48,218 --> 01:51:48,599
Thank you.

1122
01:51:48,619 --> 01:51:59,993
I think we have a couple guests that want to speak.

1123
01:52:01,695 --> 01:52:02,937
And if I just may comment on that.

1124
01:52:03,918 --> 01:52:07,161
As far as I'm concerned, for what it's worth, I trust Ms.

1125
01:52:07,241 --> 01:52:11,364
Ray and her team so greatly.

1126
01:52:11,384 --> 01:52:15,868
And believe me, I would say if I didn't, I think everybody knows that I would.

1127
01:52:15,928 --> 01:52:17,389
So I just want you to know that Ms.

1128
01:52:17,449 --> 01:52:19,030
Ray, I trust what you're doing.

1129
01:52:19,191 --> 01:52:24,735
I know you have the health and safety of our students and staff in mind at every decision you make.

1130
01:52:26,377 --> 01:52:26,557
Ms.

1131
01:52:26,577 --> 01:52:26,857
Willard.

1132
01:52:34,018 --> 01:53:02,547
Hi, so I was just wondering because she spoke an hour ago now, if we could get a response from any of the administrators on Charlene Douglas or Joanne McKay about the letters that they wrote in representing teachers at the Roberts for Joanne McKay and teachers, the full membership at Medford, if we could just get a response on that.

1133
01:53:03,107 --> 01:53:04,108
really appreciate that.

1134
01:53:08,349 --> 01:53:20,115
I think we did a number of us did respond in different ways but um well there was a request that was made um about going remote and I don't think um that was outright

1135
01:53:21,864 --> 01:53:30,129
discussed at all as to why to not do that, why to do that, and I don't think it was discussed at all.

1136
01:53:30,169 --> 01:53:34,993
So I'm just wondering, I think teachers are looking for some reassurance.

1137
01:53:35,773 --> 01:53:40,917
Everyone who I've talked to is extremely nervous about the situation.

1138
01:53:41,337 --> 01:53:45,400
I know the data we have is based on earlier months in the fall,

1139
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:49,763
We're seeing extremely high cases that are happening now.

1140
01:53:50,164 --> 01:53:52,586
Students were not tested until last week.

1141
01:53:53,186 --> 01:54:00,632
So we're getting this new information now, but the numbers that are coming in are coming in from Thanksgiving now.

1142
01:54:00,713 --> 01:54:04,075
We still don't know the full brunt of that effect.

1143
01:54:06,984 --> 01:54:11,546
I'm just wondering if someone could respond to that.

1144
01:54:11,566 --> 01:54:17,789
Because teachers need reassurance and we're not getting that from administrators right now.

1145
01:54:18,889 --> 01:54:20,310
I'm sorry you feel that way, Ms.

1146
01:54:20,370 --> 01:54:20,710
Willard.

1147
01:54:21,290 --> 01:54:24,972
I feel I was very clear about what I said earlier.

1148
01:54:25,152 --> 01:54:26,733
We are providing testing.

1149
01:54:27,113 --> 01:54:28,253
Tomorrow's Tuesday.

1150
01:54:28,694 --> 01:54:33,336
So you will have an opportunity as well to participate in testing in your respective building.

1151
01:54:34,696 --> 01:54:41,222
What I did say is I spoke with the instructional leader at the Roberts School with my team.

1152
01:54:41,422 --> 01:54:45,605
We looked at the staff that are placed on quarantine for the time being.

1153
01:54:46,286 --> 01:54:59,376
Some people that have been quarantined are because they've been identified as a close contact within the school or other people who have been quarantined, it's because of a close contact at home.

1154
01:55:00,337 --> 01:55:08,900
And so it's not related to what happened in school, but it could either be exposure at home or exposure within their respective community.

1155
01:55:09,461 --> 01:55:13,682
So we are looking at all of those pieces of data.

1156
01:55:14,262 --> 01:55:21,725
Right now, I know at the Roberts School, five homeroom teachers are currently quarantined.

1157
01:55:22,546 --> 01:55:26,187
One is scheduled to return Friday, another on Thursday.

1158
01:55:26,627 --> 01:55:27,447
So it's a moving,

1159
01:55:29,363 --> 01:55:29,883
schedule.

1160
01:55:30,624 --> 01:55:34,866
And so as administrators, we are looking at the entire school.

1161
01:55:35,886 --> 01:55:38,787
There are 23 homerooms at the Roberts school.

1162
01:55:39,528 --> 01:55:48,332
And so it's not a situation where we have 23 homeroom teachers that are not available to be in their school.

1163
01:55:48,392 --> 01:55:54,695
So each situation is different and we are responding to each situation as it comes up.

1164
01:55:55,957 --> 01:56:03,764
Throughout this entire process, we have always said that safety, consistency, and equity have been our highest priorities.

1165
01:56:04,404 --> 01:56:07,587
What Medford is doing, no other district is doing.

1166
01:56:09,208 --> 01:56:10,909
They are not testing their staff.

1167
01:56:11,230 --> 01:56:13,311
They're not testing their students.

1168
01:56:14,372 --> 01:56:16,473
We are doing that at this point in time.

1169
01:56:16,954 --> 01:56:19,815
We are prioritizing the health and safety of everyone.

1170
01:56:20,436 --> 01:56:38,525
And with the information that is gathered from the contact tracing, we've identified the staff that need to be quarantined based on the information that's given to the nurses or the board of health members that are doing the contact tracing.

1171
01:56:39,146 --> 01:56:41,807
So that is the response that we have right now.

1172
01:56:42,307 --> 01:56:42,948
If the data

1173
01:56:44,822 --> 01:56:53,486
changes or if there's a significant shift in the data, then we would make an appropriate choice or an appropriate decision at that point in time.

1174
01:56:54,186 --> 01:57:11,993
At this point in time, based on the amount of staff that are not at the Roberts School, that it's five homeroom teachers with two of them scheduled to return by the end of this week, and speaking with the instructional leader of the school, Principal Kirk Johnson,

1175
01:57:13,073 --> 01:57:16,236
And I spoke with him explicitly and had a conversation with him.

1176
01:57:16,636 --> 01:57:19,318
He said that the school can continue to function.

1177
01:57:20,018 --> 01:57:26,043
So I understand that people are very worried and tomorrow will be an opportunity for testing to take place.

1178
01:57:26,483 --> 01:57:28,185
We'll get the results on Wednesday.

1179
01:57:28,205 --> 01:57:41,275
And if the results show that there has been increased activity or uptick, we will be the first ones to communicate that out to the school committee first, and then to the community at large.

1180
01:57:42,035 --> 01:57:55,059
So I think with Wednesday being the day where students are not in person, it gives us that opportunity and a break between Cohort B and Cohort C. And the same is true.

1181
01:57:55,479 --> 01:57:56,540
We worked all weekend.

1182
01:57:57,160 --> 01:57:59,921
The students are tested on Friday for Cohort C.

1183
01:58:01,041 --> 01:58:06,103
And based on the data, we get the data by Saturday or Sunday over the course of the weekend.

1184
01:58:06,643 --> 01:58:10,325
And we take appropriate steps over the course of the weekend.

1185
01:58:10,705 --> 01:58:18,008
So I really don't feel there's anything extra that we can do at this point in time to ensure additional safety.

1186
01:58:18,528 --> 01:58:21,970
We are doing the best we can, given the resources that we have.

1187
01:58:22,490 --> 01:58:29,433
And I'm truly grateful that we are a district that's in a position to be able to say, we're doing the testing.

1188
01:58:30,253 --> 01:58:49,886
not only of staff and not only of teachers, everyone in Medford Public Schools, secretaries, paraprofessionals, custodians, you name it, cafeteria help, any department that you work in Medford Public Schools, you are allowed to be tested and have that personal peace of mind.

1189
01:58:50,666 --> 01:58:53,909
So I really feel like we're doing everything we can do

1190
01:58:55,409 --> 01:59:01,511
And we have the support of the city, the support of Tufts University, Broad Institute, Armstrong Ambulance.

1191
01:59:02,811 --> 01:59:11,093
We thank them every single time because we are so appreciative of all of the support and help that we're getting in Medford.

1192
01:59:11,753 --> 01:59:19,576
And again, if the data is different and the data says we need to make a decision, we will make that decision at the appropriate time.

1193
01:59:20,896 --> 01:59:21,216
Thank you.

1194
01:59:25,260 --> 01:59:27,100
Thank you, Gary.

1195
01:59:31,021 --> 01:59:32,421
Thank you for the opportunity to speak.

1196
01:59:32,761 --> 01:59:33,861
My name is Gary Klein.

1197
01:59:33,921 --> 01:59:38,222
I am the father of a high school student and two recent graduates.

1198
01:59:39,362 --> 01:59:46,104
I do want to thank the whole Medford public school team for all of their hard work.

1199
01:59:46,864 --> 01:59:54,645
And as the father of a student that's learning remotely, I want to particularly thank the teachers because I see how hard they work every day to teach remotely.

1200
01:59:55,902 --> 02:00:03,087
I do want to speak briefly in favor of a cautious approach to bringing kids back, particularly to the high school.

1201
02:00:03,947 --> 02:00:11,412
And my reason for that is that we have worked really hard as a community to keep numbers of cases down.

1202
02:00:12,793 --> 02:00:16,795
We, I think we're very successful over the summer.

1203
02:00:17,216 --> 02:00:24,240
And I think it's very disappointing that the numbers have been so high across the community from since Thanksgiving.

1204
02:00:25,086 --> 02:00:34,230
It looks like there were close to 500 positive cases identified across the community since Thanksgiving, based on the data that's been reported.

1205
02:00:34,711 --> 02:00:45,816
And it looks like we're on track to have close to 1,500 cases between Thanksgiving and the end of the year, which is close to 3% of the entire Medford community.

1206
02:00:46,456 --> 02:00:50,878
And I think it's very sad because we see the light at the end of the tunnel at this point.

1207
02:00:51,821 --> 02:00:53,162
There's a vaccine coming.

1208
02:00:53,862 --> 02:00:55,523
We just have to make it a few more months.

1209
02:00:56,304 --> 02:01:20,217
And I think because the school system is so integrally tied to the community, there is some risk in light of the high numbers that the schools will contribute, whether it's in-school transmission or just because kids are bringing COVID

1210
02:01:20,996 --> 02:01:29,732
from home to the schools or perhaps vice versa, that somehow that there will be a contribution to the high numbers from opening schools.

1211
02:01:30,593 --> 02:01:32,857
And I do think that high school students are different.

1212
02:01:33,294 --> 02:01:41,440
I think the data suggests that there's more risk with older kids of transmission than there is with younger kids.

1213
02:01:41,901 --> 02:01:44,443
I think that kids' behaviors are different in high school.

1214
02:01:44,463 --> 02:01:54,851
And I think if we could just be a little patient, be a little cautious, and make a little extra effort, we'll get to the point where there are vaccines.

1215
02:01:55,271 --> 02:01:59,735
We can open the schools fully without so much anxiety.

1216
02:02:00,471 --> 02:02:02,294
and go back to a normal life.

1217
02:02:02,775 --> 02:02:07,041
I really appreciate the opportunity to speak and hope you'll consider my views.

1218
02:02:07,782 --> 02:02:08,544
Thank you, Mr. Klein.

1219
02:02:08,864 --> 02:02:09,485
We appreciate it.

1220
02:02:14,212 --> 02:02:15,995
Number three, we have report on Medford

1221
02:02:16,519 --> 02:02:21,002
participation in state record.

1222
02:02:21,823 --> 02:02:29,448
I have three emails I forgot to read and they're related to this so I should read them now I think.

1223
02:02:30,949 --> 02:02:38,394
There is actually one that I'll just read it it's short it's from Sharon Hayes of Ripley Road

1224
02:02:39,235 --> 02:02:42,796
Can you please clarify when the parent survey that was discussed earlier is due?

1225
02:02:42,896 --> 02:02:44,936
I believe the superintendent said it's due tomorrow.

1226
02:02:45,456 --> 02:02:47,897
If so, can you please extend the time to respond?

1227
02:02:47,957 --> 02:02:50,917
Many parents at the Roberts School have not yet received the survey.

1228
02:02:55,898 --> 02:02:58,798
Yes, we can definitely give an extension.

1229
02:02:59,759 --> 02:02:59,919
Ms.

1230
02:02:59,939 --> 02:03:00,339
Galluzzi?

1231
02:03:00,959 --> 02:03:02,559
Yep, just point of clarification.

1232
02:03:02,599 --> 02:03:04,819
The surveys were to be out by tomorrow morning.

1233
02:03:04,879 --> 02:03:07,240
They're due next Tuesday, December 15th.

1234
02:03:09,408 --> 02:03:09,768
Thank you.

1235
02:03:09,788 --> 02:03:10,669
Thank you.

1236
02:03:11,409 --> 02:03:15,352
The next one is from Jamie Taylor of Burnside Street.

1237
02:03:16,012 --> 02:03:16,532
Good evening.

1238
02:03:17,113 --> 02:03:17,553
Question.

1239
02:03:17,673 --> 02:03:20,035
Parents do not need to get their child tested.

1240
02:03:20,055 --> 02:03:22,796
They can simply have them quarantine at home.

1241
02:03:23,016 --> 02:03:26,118
Therefore, no contact tracing of the student happens, correct?

1242
02:03:26,779 --> 02:03:28,740
As an example, I test positive.

1243
02:03:29,276 --> 02:03:32,038
I pull my daughter from school, but I don't have her tested.

1244
02:03:32,818 --> 02:03:34,960
Who is to say I didn't get it from her?

1245
02:03:35,240 --> 02:03:37,742
What about her teachers or friends at school?

1246
02:03:37,842 --> 02:03:39,263
Please correct me if I am wrong.

1247
02:03:40,163 --> 02:03:45,607
Also, we are going by the honor system, and we can clearly see that this isn't working.

1248
02:03:46,287 --> 02:03:52,711
We had children come to school Monday after Thanksgiving, after coming from out of state, and after attending large family gatherings.

1249
02:03:52,911 --> 02:03:53,692
Teachers are all

1250
02:03:54,085 --> 02:03:57,286
are doing all that we can inside the building.

1251
02:03:57,846 --> 02:04:00,967
We need the community support once those kids leave the building.

1252
02:04:01,287 --> 02:04:03,048
Schools are a part of the community.

1253
02:04:03,488 --> 02:04:08,829
So to say it's not in schools when we aren't testing 100% of the students seems hard to swallow.

1254
02:04:08,849 --> 02:04:11,370
If anybody wants to respond to that.

1255
02:04:11,390 --> 02:04:21,853
I could just say very quickly, I think Mr. Rice should address some of the public health related questions, but I almost said this a second ago when we were,

1256
02:04:23,127 --> 02:04:24,288
discussing Ms.

1257
02:04:24,308 --> 02:04:26,469
Graham's point with regard to the transparency of the numbers.

1258
02:04:26,489 --> 02:04:31,672
And I think it was stated that as you begin to test, you sort of see the ugliness of the numbers.

1259
02:04:32,333 --> 02:04:42,519
So of the seven or eight positives that were picked up in the course of the last week, there were nearly 1,300 tests administered in the public schools.

1260
02:04:43,019 --> 02:04:49,603
So I think that the ugliness is significantly diminished when we focus on the numerator.

1261
02:04:52,627 --> 02:04:54,148
excuse me, the denominator.

1262
02:04:55,828 --> 02:05:20,239
So yeah, I don't think there's, even in the discussion tonight with regard to some of the operational challenges, the virtually non-existent transmission in school, I think sort of informs the point that to the degree we've needed to transition to remote in pockets,

1263
02:05:21,004 --> 02:05:32,594
and would have to potentially consider transitioning to remote for a school, if that were to happen, that will be based as the superintendent was referencing in response to Ms.

1264
02:05:32,634 --> 02:05:44,143
Vanderkoop, based on the operational challenges of coverage and other issues because of the number of people that are quarantining, not because of the public health risk.

1265
02:05:44,884 --> 02:05:49,408
Now that could change and we have to continue to be vigilant and we have to continue to

1266
02:05:49,963 --> 02:05:59,528
to look at the data, as the superintendent said in her report about particularly as older students are coming in, there are different risk factors and we have to continue to look at those very, very closely.

1267
02:06:00,068 --> 02:06:07,032
But the sort of conclusory statement that clearly this hasn't worked, I don't think is grounded in fact.

1268
02:06:07,272 --> 02:06:18,498
And so I think we have to be really, really careful about that because there are risks, there are dangers, we do have a responsibility to respond to them appropriately, but the statement that

1269
02:06:19,677 --> 02:06:21,958
this hasn't worked is just inaccurate at this point.

1270
02:06:28,121 --> 02:06:33,263
And I think the question is, if you have a family member that's positive, Ms.

1271
02:06:34,344 --> 02:06:42,187
Ray, then the student gets taken out for a period of time to quarantine, does the student have to produce a negative test before coming back?

1272
02:06:43,186 --> 02:06:46,589
So I'll explain some of the quarantining protocols.

1273
02:06:48,651 --> 02:06:56,397
There are a number of different options and families can decide not to test and then to keep their child home for a full 14 days.

1274
02:06:58,058 --> 02:07:12,510
I think what's worth examining is that if you do test, especially if you test around day eight, your child with a negative test is able to come back into school on day 11.

1275
02:07:12,930 --> 02:07:16,794
So that gets them back in for three extra school days that they

1276
02:07:17,833 --> 02:07:21,774
by quarantining full 14 days, they would miss those days.

1277
02:07:23,435 --> 02:07:35,398
We are also waiting for changing and updating guidelines from the Mass Department of Public Health that is looking at reducing the number of quarantine days.

1278
02:07:35,498 --> 02:07:40,560
And we are waiting for all of that information to come across our desks.

1279
02:07:42,844 --> 02:07:45,105
So we really encourage the testing.

1280
02:07:45,486 --> 02:07:50,029
We encourage families to provide results of the testing when they're negative.

1281
02:07:52,811 --> 02:07:55,814
And because we can really get your child back into school sooner.

1282
02:07:55,834 --> 02:07:57,955
And that's, that's our goal.

1283
02:08:01,327 --> 02:08:02,888
We're asking families to work with us.

1284
02:08:03,009 --> 02:08:07,292
We're asking families to answer those phone calls from the Board of Health.

1285
02:08:07,692 --> 02:08:12,455
We're asking families to limit outside activities.

1286
02:08:13,316 --> 02:08:16,138
Again, as Governor Baker says, safer at home.

1287
02:08:16,678 --> 02:08:20,941
Those are all measures that will help keep students in school.

1288
02:08:24,484 --> 02:08:24,844
Thank you.

1289
02:08:24,864 --> 02:08:26,265
I have one more email.

1290
02:08:28,507 --> 02:08:29,628
We were done with that one, I think, right?

1291
02:08:31,676 --> 02:08:32,276
I think so, yes.

1292
02:08:32,836 --> 02:08:33,757
Okay, thank you.

1293
02:08:33,857 --> 02:08:41,239
And the next one is from Leticia Rocha at Mystic Valley Parkway.

1294
02:08:45,560 --> 02:08:46,201
A few questions.

1295
02:08:48,527 --> 02:08:48,827
As Ms.

1296
02:08:48,847 --> 02:08:49,368
Douglas and Ms.

1297
02:08:49,408 --> 02:08:53,851
Kay mentioned, in the last seven days, MedBird has had 295 new COVID cases.

1298
02:08:53,991 --> 02:08:59,136
What exactly is the city's capacity for contact tracing and how will this apply to schools?

1299
02:08:59,216 --> 02:09:03,399
And I'll just do them one at a time rather than trying to expect everybody to remember them all.

1300
02:09:05,100 --> 02:09:06,181
I can speak to the city.

1301
02:09:06,261 --> 02:09:16,770
The city has a good deal of staff and we're keeping up with it pretty well, although because of the amounts of cases, we are sending cases to the state CTC.

1302
02:09:17,643 --> 02:09:20,686
to help with that and misreading on the schools.

1303
02:09:21,146 --> 02:09:25,050
And I would say we compliment Marianne O'Connor staff.

1304
02:09:25,290 --> 02:09:30,334
So I have some nurses that do contract with the board of health as contact tracers.

1305
02:09:31,255 --> 02:09:43,006
In addition, during the school week, oftentimes the board of health reaches out to us because we know the school environment and we can conduct those interviews within the school environment.

1306
02:09:43,686 --> 02:09:49,328
in a more streamlined manner than they would be able to from on the Board of Health side.

1307
02:09:49,608 --> 02:09:55,449
So it really is a collaborative and complementary effort between both departments.

1308
02:09:57,510 --> 02:09:57,890
Thank you.

1309
02:09:58,010 --> 02:09:58,570
Next one.

1310
02:09:58,650 --> 02:10:02,951
Madam Mayor, Mr. Russo, if I could just real quick, I think it also needs to be mentioned that

1311
02:10:03,456 --> 02:10:08,477
The school nurses and members of the Board of Health are essentially working seven days a week, 24 seven.

1312
02:10:09,017 --> 02:10:10,338
They are contact tracing.

1313
02:10:11,238 --> 02:10:14,599
They are working the system continuously and constantly.

1314
02:10:15,179 --> 02:10:26,522
And I really believe that we need to give an enormous round of applause to the school nurses and the other people who are doing their level best to make sure that we're able to contact trace appropriately.

1315
02:10:29,522 --> 02:10:30,322
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

1316
02:10:33,139 --> 02:10:33,879
Thank you.

1317
02:10:34,260 --> 02:10:37,381
What is the current Medford positivity rate without the Tufts tests?

1318
02:10:37,401 --> 02:10:39,802
I don't know if we have that available right here.

1319
02:10:41,323 --> 02:10:42,824
I know a couple of weeks ago, it was 0.96.

1320
02:10:44,144 --> 02:10:47,066
And without Tufts, we were at 1.11%.

1321
02:10:48,726 --> 02:10:53,789
So Tufts does affect our numbers, but not as much as we would expect.

1322
02:10:54,049 --> 02:11:01,292
And at the time, I think it was because Tufts did about 3,200 tests, and the city in its entirety did about 15,000 to 16,000.

1323
02:11:05,472 --> 02:11:07,034
than this week's numbers I don't have.

1324
02:11:07,775 --> 02:11:08,877
Okay, thank you.

1325
02:11:10,239 --> 02:11:19,172
According to DESE records, a total of 527 new cases of COVID-19 were reported among students and staff in Massachusetts public schools over the past week.

1326
02:11:20,254 --> 02:11:29,985
Framingham Public Schools, for example, have now gone fully remote because they found school transmission occurring in their buildings, given the high rates of community transmission occurring broadly within the city.

1327
02:11:30,546 --> 02:11:37,513
With Medford reaching 295 new cases in a week, what is stopping school transmission from occurring as it did in Framingham?

1328
02:11:38,394 --> 02:11:51,398
And this is especially important to consider as seniors enter in-person learning, seeing as they are effectively adults in their ability to spread the virus and have higher freedom interacting with the community.

1329
02:11:51,718 --> 02:11:58,680
A recent study has found that the case rate among high school students nationally is nearly three times that of elementary school age children.

1330
02:11:59,380 --> 02:12:06,342
And I have not heard this addressed at all from the school administration side, aside from offering testing that is not mandatory.

1331
02:12:10,177 --> 02:12:10,357
Ms.

1332
02:12:10,397 --> 02:12:10,577
Ray.

1333
02:12:12,177 --> 02:12:17,438
I just wanted to again remind people of the advantage of the student of the COVID testing.

1334
02:12:19,099 --> 02:12:36,962
There are minimal districts across the state that are doing testing and it provides us with a phenomenal advantage to identify students early who are infected and remove them from our school buildings so that we can minimize the number of close contacts.

1335
02:12:38,743 --> 02:12:39,203
That is a

1336
02:12:40,461 --> 02:12:47,545
a phenomenal advantage that we are offering with the support of Tufts and the Medford Board of Health and Armstrong Ambulance.

1337
02:12:53,729 --> 02:12:56,390
Okay, I will get to the last two questions.

1338
02:12:56,630 --> 02:12:58,031
We received notification today.

1339
02:12:58,431 --> 02:12:59,112
Did I unmute?

1340
02:12:59,132 --> 02:12:59,512
Sorry, yes.

1341
02:13:00,012 --> 02:13:05,195
We received notification today that the MCAS for 11th grade students was postponed instead of occurring in January.

1342
02:13:05,676 --> 02:13:07,557
What is the reason for this postponement?

1343
02:13:09,943 --> 02:13:13,566
Uh, so, uh, Madam Mayor, if you'll allow me to speak on that.

1344
02:13:13,626 --> 02:13:14,007
Thank you.

1345
02:13:14,627 --> 02:13:18,110
So the postponement was from last year.

1346
02:13:18,130 --> 02:13:30,580
Um, the juniors are being tested on their graduation requirement in order to earn a diploma by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, um, and awarded by the Met for public schools.

1347
02:13:31,481 --> 02:13:34,804
Um, so this January testing, um, has been

1348
02:13:35,906 --> 02:13:37,988
the dates have been dictated by DESE.

1349
02:13:38,088 --> 02:13:58,123
Now DESE has opened up a four-week window for us to complete this, whereas normally it is prescribed days and prescribed times per test, especially at the high school level as it's the same test that's distributed across the state.

1350
02:13:58,283 --> 02:14:02,846
So while they've given us some flexibility, it is not without

1351
02:14:05,608 --> 02:14:11,430
burden and concern on a great many fronts.

1352
02:14:11,710 --> 02:14:18,233
The students will be taking these tests coming up at the end of January.

1353
02:14:20,474 --> 02:14:20,834
Thank you.

1354
02:14:21,494 --> 02:14:31,218
And the last question is, when does the school administration intend to design a plan for school closures to avoid a sudden shutdown like what happened in March?

1355
02:14:36,122 --> 02:14:37,243
Can you read that one more time, please?

1356
02:14:37,843 --> 02:14:38,303
Sure, sorry.

1357
02:14:38,884 --> 02:14:45,828
When does the school administration intend to design a plan for school closures to avoid a sudden shutdown like what happened in March?

1358
02:14:46,488 --> 02:14:59,876
Yeah, I think that relates to our community, our metrics scale, which is what was discussed over the weekend, how many cases we had at each school, how many cases, what would arise to shutting down a school, depending on the case level.

1359
02:14:59,936 --> 02:15:03,038
That's all can be found on our school website.

1360
02:15:05,440 --> 02:15:05,740
Thank you.

1361
02:15:06,789 --> 02:15:08,330
And Dr. Mr. Murphy.

1362
02:15:08,691 --> 02:15:15,175
Just I think to the degree that the question is about what happens if there is a closure, what happens after the closure.

1363
02:15:15,235 --> 02:15:34,930
The entire academic schedule has been designed so that if the circumstances required it, school would continue and the system would withstand the transition to remote and would follow along on that schedule and students would continue to receive the exposure to the content.

1364
02:15:35,384 --> 02:15:37,164
through the structure that was developed.

1365
02:15:37,624 --> 02:15:52,447
So I think the real difference between now and school year in between in March, 2020 is that in March, 2020, it hadn't occurred to anyone in this state or any other one that all of a sudden everyone would be learning from home.

1366
02:15:52,887 --> 02:16:02,469
Whereas this year, the entire plan was developed so that as was the case between September 16th and September 28th for most vulnerable students and September 16th and

1367
02:16:03,800 --> 02:16:10,904
up until tomorrow for high school students, that there is a schedule and there's a structure in place to support that learning.

1368
02:16:10,964 --> 02:16:19,009
So I think the answer to the question would be that that plan was developed several months ago and is in place in the event that becomes necessary.

1369
02:16:20,910 --> 02:16:21,210
Thank you.

1370
02:16:21,230 --> 02:16:22,531
That's the end of the emails for now.

1371
02:16:23,354 --> 02:16:26,036
Also, Madam Mayor and Mr. Russo, I misspoke.

1372
02:16:26,076 --> 02:16:31,440
We were updated today that the testing is delayed from January.

1373
02:16:31,540 --> 02:16:37,924
So I can provide more information on that at the next school committee meeting with Mr. Valleva.

1374
02:16:38,424 --> 02:16:43,988
But for everything I just said, which was up to date until earlier today, please belay that.

1375
02:16:45,349 --> 02:16:45,629
Mayor?

1376
02:16:45,649 --> 02:16:46,430
Thank you.

1377
02:16:46,450 --> 02:16:47,350
Madam Mayor.

1378
02:16:48,431 --> 02:16:51,353
Adam is seeking to, has his hand up for a long time.

1379
02:16:51,837 --> 02:16:53,078
Yes, I was going to that next.

1380
02:16:54,459 --> 02:16:54,699
Adam.

1381
02:16:58,881 --> 02:16:59,922
Hi, my name is Jessica.

1382
02:17:00,542 --> 02:17:07,707
I just had a quick question that Miss Ray was saying about the testing for kids that quarantine.

1383
02:17:11,281 --> 02:17:15,202
I, my son was quarantined in the beginning of October.

1384
02:17:15,222 --> 02:17:21,603
I actually asked about the testing as they didn't say anything about testing.

1385
02:17:22,384 --> 02:17:27,685
And they said, even if he got tested, they still have to stay home for the full 14 days.

1386
02:17:28,225 --> 02:17:32,226
So I'm just wondering if this is something new that they can come back after 11 days.

1387
02:17:33,363 --> 02:17:34,704
Yes, everything's changing.

1388
02:17:34,844 --> 02:17:36,724
Actually, that was the guidance last week.

1389
02:17:36,784 --> 02:17:37,265
And as Ms.

1390
02:17:37,305 --> 02:17:41,046
Ray said, there's even new guidance coming out this week that may change it even more.

1391
02:17:41,066 --> 02:17:44,708
So that is updated guidance over the last several weeks.

1392
02:17:45,488 --> 02:17:46,328
Okay, thank you.

1393
02:17:46,809 --> 02:17:47,169
Thank you.

1394
02:17:56,292 --> 02:18:02,135
We have number three, reporter methods participation in state's rapid testing program using

1395
02:18:02,893 --> 02:18:06,114
Abbott Binax now tests COVID-19.

1396
02:18:06,154 --> 02:18:06,294
Ms.

1397
02:18:06,314 --> 02:18:06,734
Toni Ray.

1398
02:18:06,754 --> 02:18:08,835
Okay, thank you again.

1399
02:18:09,255 --> 02:18:24,260
So I'm happy to announce that as a district, we applied with the Department of Public Health and the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to be a pilot district for the Abbott Binax rapid point of care testing.

1400
02:18:26,320 --> 02:18:29,722
Thank you, Tom, for moving, or Peter, for moving the slides forward.

1401
02:18:31,913 --> 02:18:46,557
This testing can rapidly identify individuals who are symptomatic with disease symptoms so that we can appropriately isolate them and start the contact tracing.

1402
02:18:47,257 --> 02:18:54,339
It is highly sensitive when used with symptomatic people, up to 97% sensitivity and 98.5 specificity.

1403
02:18:58,588 --> 02:19:00,590
The test administration is very easy.

1404
02:19:01,191 --> 02:19:08,638
It is similar to the nasal swabbing that we have been doing as part of our surveillance screening.

1405
02:19:09,739 --> 02:19:14,944
There is a little card that a reagent solution gets placed on the card.

1406
02:19:15,505 --> 02:19:18,768
After the nose is swabbed, the swab is placed on the card.

1407
02:19:19,128 --> 02:19:20,550
It's rotating around.

1408
02:19:20,991 --> 02:19:29,770
and then it sits for 15 minutes and then if it is positive, you will receive a positive reading.

1409
02:19:32,650 --> 02:19:44,381
The advantage it provides for us is that we can, for students who test positive, we can move immediately into the protocols for responding to COVID illnesses.

1410
02:19:44,942 --> 02:19:52,689
For those who test negative, we would change our course of medical referral information and recommend

1411
02:19:53,089 --> 02:19:58,635
that students be seen by their physician for PCR testing.

1412
02:19:59,836 --> 02:20:09,587
Again, depending upon those test results, students may be able to return to school sooner than the 14-day quarantine.

1413
02:20:11,489 --> 02:20:11,889
Thank you.

1414
02:20:11,929 --> 02:20:12,470
The next one.

1415
02:20:15,633 --> 02:20:28,721
For students who have minimal symptoms, which are considered the isolated runny nose, the isolated headache, the isolated fatigue, we would be able to administer the test.

1416
02:20:29,542 --> 02:20:34,905
If they test positive, we would again move to the protocol for responding to COVID-19 scenarios.

1417
02:20:35,365 --> 02:20:39,188
If they test negative, they would be able to return to class.

1418
02:20:42,836 --> 02:20:58,031
Healthcare providers that are collecting specimens are required to maintain appropriate personal protective equipment, which includes the N95 mask, eye protection, gloves, and gown.

1419
02:20:59,212 --> 02:21:06,319
Our district has obtained those supplies so that our nurses will be appropriately protected with gear.

1420
02:21:12,567 --> 02:21:19,652
The state has put together a training course that all of the school nurses will complete prior to administering the test.

1421
02:21:21,253 --> 02:21:25,456
And we will be starting that at some point in the near future.

1422
02:21:26,697 --> 02:21:32,081
We have received our approval to be what's called a CLIA lab.

1423
02:21:32,982 --> 02:21:40,407
That requires that we demonstrate we are appropriately able to store and administer the test.

1424
02:21:43,400 --> 02:21:49,805
We are required to obtain parent and guardian consent prior to administering the test.

1425
02:21:50,385 --> 02:22:04,095
And we will proactively be sending out consent forms for parents to review and return if they're interested in having their children tested when they present at the nurse's office with illness symptoms.

1426
02:22:11,715 --> 02:22:19,540
As a final piece of being a pilot district, we are required to report aggregate data to the Department of Public Health.

1427
02:22:20,541 --> 02:22:26,885
And that will include the number of positive tests that we receive out of our testing efforts.

1428
02:22:30,327 --> 02:22:30,687
Thank you.

1429
02:22:30,727 --> 02:22:34,049
If anybody has any questions, I can take those questions now.

1430
02:22:37,831 --> 02:22:38,271
Thank you, Ms.

1431
02:22:38,311 --> 02:22:38,432
Ray.

1432
02:22:38,452 --> 02:22:40,613
Any questions?

1433
02:22:41,878 --> 02:22:42,018
Okay.

1434
02:22:42,999 --> 02:22:43,579
Member Rousseau.

1435
02:22:44,579 --> 02:22:44,959
Thank you.

1436
02:22:45,039 --> 02:22:45,740
This is exciting.

1437
02:22:47,100 --> 02:23:04,328
I just have a quick question about, I think it was slide two, and you don't have to bring the slides up, about referring a positive or a presumptive positive or whatever the right word was, forgive me, to the pediatrician.

1438
02:23:05,028 --> 02:23:10,871
Why would we not just simply take advantage of the in-school testing that we're already gonna do

1439
02:23:12,655 --> 02:23:14,155
instead sending them out.

1440
02:23:14,356 --> 02:23:21,398
I mean, pediatricians' offices in general don't seem to be terribly interested in having lots of kids coming in if we're gonna literally be testing them anyways.

1441
02:23:22,158 --> 02:23:24,179
So I'm looking at that slide, Paul.

1442
02:23:24,939 --> 02:23:37,763
What you're asking a question about would be for those students who test negative on the Binax rapid point of care test, those students, because they're symptomatic, would be sent home.

1443
02:23:38,543 --> 02:23:40,304
and refer to their pediatrician.

1444
02:23:40,644 --> 02:23:48,847
Sometimes symptoms occur and they are not COVID related, they may be strep throat, ear infection, you know, whatever.

1445
02:23:49,047 --> 02:24:03,553
And upon receiving an alternate diagnosis, then that student would be able to return to school 24 hours after a fever is resolved or after their symptoms have resolved.

1446
02:24:04,434 --> 02:24:07,575
Okay, and but if they get a positive in the rapid,

1447
02:24:08,275 --> 02:24:11,116
we will then do the PCR?

1448
02:24:11,437 --> 02:24:24,843
No, if they get a positive, we're considering them positive and we would manage them according to the protocols for responding to COVID-19 scenarios.

1449
02:24:25,764 --> 02:24:29,846
Okay, so they'll get the same contact tracing even if they don't go home and get a PCR?

1450
02:24:30,806 --> 02:24:33,047
We would contact trace, yes.

1451
02:24:33,467 --> 02:24:35,508
Any positive, we will contact trace, yes.

1452
02:24:36,429 --> 02:24:36,729
Thank you.

1453
02:24:39,788 --> 02:24:40,208
Thank you.

1454
02:24:42,089 --> 02:24:44,870
Next up, we have a report on responsive classroom, Ms.

1455
02:24:44,890 --> 02:24:46,130
Suzanne Galussi and Ms.

1456
02:24:46,150 --> 02:24:46,951
Stacey Shulman.

1457
02:24:53,933 --> 02:24:54,673
Thank you very much.

1458
02:24:54,753 --> 02:25:01,076
I'm just going to have, if Dr. Cushing doesn't mind sharing his screen, I think we had a little.

1459
02:25:05,377 --> 02:25:07,778
Just give me one second to pull up the report.

1460
02:25:15,208 --> 02:25:18,570
I can just start by saying, I'll just start off by saying good evening.

1461
02:25:19,431 --> 02:25:25,555
Tonight, Stacey Shulman and I are going to be presenting a report on the Responsive Classroom Program at the elementary school level.

1462
02:25:26,596 --> 02:25:31,720
When the closure hit in March, I was the principal at the Brooks School at the time.

1463
02:25:32,440 --> 02:25:39,225
And the biggest message that I gave to my staff was centered around social emotional well-being.

1464
02:25:40,486 --> 02:25:43,468
I knew at that time that we needed to keep

1465
02:25:43,955 --> 02:26:00,669
students anchored to school, and that keeping them engaged in school was going to mean that they stayed connected, connected to their student, to their classmates, connected to their teachers, and that during this pandemic was the most important thing.

1466
02:26:00,689 --> 02:26:10,897
And so around, since the Brooks School was and is a responsive classroom school, the staff was trained

1467
02:26:11,871 --> 02:26:17,293
in the program and time was built into the schedule for morning meeting.

1468
02:26:19,194 --> 02:26:29,018
So maintaining the morning meeting time, even virtually, wasn't too much of a heavy lift and it ensured that we were able to keep kids connected.

1469
02:26:29,919 --> 02:26:40,964
And around that time, Stacey Shulman and I connected over and planning for the social emotional wave that we just anticipated was

1470
02:26:42,665 --> 02:26:45,346
coming our way as a result of COVID.

1471
02:26:45,846 --> 02:26:54,288
And so we started talking about responsive classroom and the implementation of it at the elementary level district wide.

1472
02:26:55,528 --> 02:27:00,809
And with that being said, I'm going to pass it off to Stacey just to frame it a little bit.

1473
02:27:02,510 --> 02:27:02,850
Our work.

1474
02:27:11,713 --> 02:27:14,895
I think that's difficulty unmuting her.

1475
02:27:14,915 --> 02:27:18,238
There you go.

1476
02:27:18,258 --> 02:27:20,179
Sorry, I thought I had made her co-host already.

1477
02:27:20,219 --> 02:27:20,799
That's okay.

1478
02:27:20,879 --> 02:27:21,600
Thank you so much.

1479
02:27:21,640 --> 02:27:22,140
Good evening.

1480
02:27:22,160 --> 02:27:24,422
I just want to build on what Ms.

1481
02:27:24,442 --> 02:27:25,363
Galussi was saying.

1482
02:27:25,443 --> 02:27:30,906
In the springtime, we reviewed what we expected to be some challenges and also the needs of our students.

1483
02:27:31,487 --> 02:27:40,053
And some of the challenges that we saw for coming us in the fall, which has passed now would be a different start to the school year for our students, not knowing what that would be.

1484
02:27:40,768 --> 02:27:46,273
Student cohorting, we assumed at that time in the spring, there were a lot of talks about potential hybrids.

1485
02:27:47,594 --> 02:27:50,216
Anxiety and uncertainty of COVID-19.

1486
02:27:50,917 --> 02:27:52,738
The gap of in-person instruction.

1487
02:27:52,798 --> 02:28:00,805
So even if our students were coming back right away, we knew that they had missed a significant period of time of in-person instruction, as well as new learning modalities.

1488
02:28:01,486 --> 02:28:08,972
For most of our students, we expected at least some online learning or a different style of learning with distancing.

1489
02:28:09,571 --> 02:28:26,666
some of the needs of our students we foresaw was to build positive connections within the classroom, to provide space for questions and support, explicit social-emotional instruction, re-acclimation to the classroom environment, and to provide routines and structure.

1490
02:28:31,271 --> 02:28:36,115
This is an overview of the timeline for the responsive classroom implementation.

1491
02:28:37,185 --> 02:28:43,329
In May and June, we formed teams that would help us provide training to the rest of our elementary staff.

1492
02:28:43,509 --> 02:28:54,976
I wanna explicitly thank those four teachers who helped us from the Brooks School, Janelle DeSantos, Christine Vianneau, Jen Ellis, and Brooke Tuttle, who were unbelievable at our call.

1493
02:28:55,016 --> 02:29:05,443
When we said, we need your help to provide training to the rest of Medford, they immediately rose to the occasion and built phenomenal asynchronous trainings, and were there when we called for those synchronous.

1494
02:29:06,565 --> 02:29:07,786
coaching sessions as well.

1495
02:29:07,826 --> 02:29:16,110
So explicitly, I want to say thank you to those wonderful teachers who really, really stepped up and put a lot of time in over their summer to help us.

1496
02:29:16,931 --> 02:29:26,316
So in July and August, we received some grant funding through CARES, which allowed us to sort of set off and put the plan in motion for our training.

1497
02:29:27,296 --> 02:29:31,779
During that 10 day window in September when staff participated in robust

1498
02:29:33,127 --> 02:29:38,249
professional development, we provided that asynchronous training on a responsive classroom, as well as coaching sessions.

1499
02:29:38,309 --> 02:29:49,333
So they could follow up and say, I went through everything, here are my questions and received some great responses and additional resources that they could use, including examples.

1500
02:29:50,513 --> 02:29:54,534
In October, we surveyed our staff to say, how is it going?

1501
02:29:54,554 --> 02:29:55,335
What else do you need?

1502
02:29:55,395 --> 02:29:57,055
How comfortable are you with this process?

1503
02:29:57,075 --> 02:29:58,136
And we'll share that later.

1504
02:29:58,656 --> 02:30:01,897
And we'll continue to analyze survey results, provide more training.

1505
02:30:03,026 --> 02:30:06,451
and continue with some coaching sessions for the rest of our staff.

1506
02:30:07,092 --> 02:30:08,354
I'll turn it back to Ms.

1507
02:30:08,374 --> 02:30:13,462
Galussi now, who will explain a little bit more in depth about exactly what is responsive classroom.

1508
02:30:14,453 --> 02:30:14,933
Thank you.

1509
02:30:15,554 --> 02:30:25,303
So responsive classroom it's an approach it's not specifically a program, you know, or necessarily a curriculum it's often used in collaboration with other programs.

1510
02:30:25,864 --> 02:30:32,030
So there are some schools in the district, particularly the Columbus that is a PBS school positive behavior support.

1511
02:30:32,630 --> 02:30:39,898
that works in conjunction with responsive classroom and even at the Brooks there were elements of PBIS woven into the responsive classroom approach.

1512
02:30:40,518 --> 02:30:47,045
We also use zones of regulation within the Medford public schools and both programs work really nicely together.

1513
02:30:47,746 --> 02:30:53,712
So responsive classroom is an approach where there is a belief that children learn best

1514
02:30:54,553 --> 02:30:59,696
when we're developing their social-emotional skills as well as their academic skills.

1515
02:31:00,816 --> 02:31:14,143
And there's a lot to be said for that, especially as mentioned before about the zones of regulation, which is true that students can't really learn if they're not in the green zone, if they're not feeling safe and comfortable.

1516
02:31:15,063 --> 02:31:22,647
You need the social-emotional development of skills in order to really be able to focus on the academic skills that students need in school.

1517
02:31:24,930 --> 02:31:25,711
Next slide please.

1518
02:31:27,933 --> 02:31:42,705
Okay, so the responsive classroom has many components to it, where we've done the training on a lot of these components, but not all of these components and we're just the beginning here.

1519
02:31:43,446 --> 02:31:47,069
So some of the components of responsive classroom is morning meeting.

1520
02:31:47,737 --> 02:31:58,908
in which if there are parents or educators on this call, you know that at the elementary level, whether it's the hybrid learning model or the remote academy, students are starting their day in a morning meeting.

1521
02:32:00,270 --> 02:32:08,058
This is a time for the class to gather together and work to build that positive culture.

1522
02:32:08,747 --> 02:32:10,848
that is going to support learning.

1523
02:32:11,588 --> 02:32:23,851
It's also what's nice about starting the day with morning meeting is it gives a structured routine that students desperately crave all the time, but especially right now during COVID.

1524
02:32:25,111 --> 02:32:27,712
That also part of the,

1525
02:32:29,649 --> 02:32:34,872
real important piece of responsive classroom is the rules creation, which really should be done in collaboration with the students.

1526
02:32:36,092 --> 02:32:44,737
That makes the students feel like they have a voice in how they're going to feel safe within the classroom and build collaboration with their peers.

1527
02:32:46,097 --> 02:32:51,640
It also creates instant buy-in when they feel that they have a piece of creating the rules of the classroom.

1528
02:32:52,562 --> 02:32:55,383
The interactive modeling is extremely important.

1529
02:32:55,423 --> 02:32:58,524
I'm going to get into that a little bit in the next slide, not yet.

1530
02:32:58,644 --> 02:33:13,428
But when we talk about one of the trainings that the teachers had, which was on the first six weeks, in order for students to truly understand what both the social emotional skills that we're trying to develop in students

1531
02:33:14,312 --> 02:33:20,754
and the academic skills, what they look like, what they sound like within a classroom, you need to have modeling.

1532
02:33:20,934 --> 02:33:21,895
Students need to see it.

1533
02:33:21,975 --> 02:33:27,116
They need to hear it in order for them to truly understand what is being expected of them.

1534
02:33:28,177 --> 02:33:30,478
Another component is a positive teacher language.

1535
02:33:32,396 --> 02:33:46,707
This is an approach to making sure that when adults are interacting with other adults and when adults are interacting with students, we're mindful of the tone we use and the words and language we use when we're speaking to people.

1536
02:33:47,408 --> 02:33:58,997
And so there's a lot of training around being more aware and cognizant of the actual words we're using when we're interacting with big people and little people.

1537
02:33:59,801 --> 02:34:14,295
And then logical consequences piece so inevitably, in any situation, there are going to be some misbehaviors and some challenging behaviors and making sure that our consequences are aligned to that behavior.

1538
02:34:15,376 --> 02:34:27,522
makes it logical and makes it more, it has more of an impact on students if we're dealing with those misbehaviors in a way that's tied to the direct behavior.

1539
02:34:28,102 --> 02:34:38,827
That is going to make the connection for the student as to hopefully in the next time, the learning is there as to why their behavior was not appropriate.

1540
02:34:40,092 --> 02:34:40,853
Next slide please.

1541
02:34:41,594 --> 02:34:50,586
So the first training that staff received and the way that the responsive classroom starts the year is a program or an approach called the first six weeks.

1542
02:34:51,426 --> 02:34:57,672
The first six weeks is the foundation to a successful school year.

1543
02:34:57,772 --> 02:34:59,094
It's like the building blocks.

1544
02:34:59,594 --> 02:35:13,008
So at the Brooks School, we gave pretty much the month of September to the first six weeks in laying the groundwork for what the school year was going to look like, both

1545
02:35:14,244 --> 02:35:17,845
for the social emotional skill development and the academic skill development.

1546
02:35:18,525 --> 02:35:38,329
We gave our Medford Public Schools teachers this year the same time so that they could create their classroom environment and set of expectations so that come October 1st, we could hit the ground running and those sorts of routines and behaviors and expectations were already set.

1547
02:35:39,569 --> 02:35:42,850
This is the time where that modeling is so crucial.

1548
02:35:43,235 --> 02:35:59,040
So that teachers, you have this time for teachers to introduce students to their peers, to the building, to their teacher, to the space within the classroom, and to the expectations for learning within the classroom, whether it's virtual or in person.

1549
02:35:59,580 --> 02:36:01,542
The first six weeks is when you're modeling.

1550
02:36:01,842 --> 02:36:02,643
What does it look like?

1551
02:36:02,683 --> 02:36:05,685
What does it sound like when we have math class?

1552
02:36:06,246 --> 02:36:07,086
What does it look like?

1553
02:36:07,127 --> 02:36:11,330
What does it sound like when you're working with peers collaboratively?

1554
02:36:11,570 --> 02:36:12,311
What does it look like?

1555
02:36:12,331 --> 02:36:17,435
What does it sound like when we have to walk out to recess or to specials?

1556
02:36:17,935 --> 02:36:19,657
What does it look like, sound like to

1557
02:36:22,244 --> 02:36:23,285
during writing block.

1558
02:36:23,745 --> 02:36:34,616
All of the routines of the school day and all of the expectations around behavior and academics happen within what's called the first six weeks.

1559
02:36:36,350 --> 02:36:45,557
And then the next slide is the second training that staff had, and that for some of us is new, is the morning meeting block.

1560
02:36:46,118 --> 02:36:49,860
So morning meeting, as mentioned, is that predictable time for students.

1561
02:36:49,901 --> 02:36:55,845
It's a time where you build on your community and a time where students can feel safe.

1562
02:36:56,325 --> 02:36:58,387
There are four components to morning meeting.

1563
02:37:00,997 --> 02:37:04,680
Most feel that it should keep this, which is why they're numbered 1, 2, 3, 4.

1564
02:37:05,901 --> 02:37:06,861
It should keep that order.

1565
02:37:07,182 --> 02:37:10,324
But there's definite flexibility to whatever works in the classroom.

1566
02:37:10,384 --> 02:37:14,507
So the most morning meetings start with a greeting.

1567
02:37:15,047 --> 02:37:18,150
And so there's several ways you can do this and lots of creative, fun ways.

1568
02:37:19,090 --> 02:37:24,651
A lot of times in the first six weeks, teachers will maybe review all those different ways that you could greet one another.

1569
02:37:25,992 --> 02:37:31,293
This year, I know as part of the training, those four fabulous trainers that Ms.

1570
02:37:31,333 --> 02:37:40,615
Schulman mentioned also gave some adaptations for how things could be done now that we have to keep six feet of social distancing.

1571
02:37:40,675 --> 02:37:43,736
So, you know, we can't do the hand shaking anymore.

1572
02:37:43,836 --> 02:37:47,997
And some of the greetings that we typically have done in the past

1573
02:37:48,755 --> 02:37:51,437
had to be a little bit more adapted this year to six feet.

1574
02:37:51,898 --> 02:38:00,305
The second piece is the sharing, which usually there's a schedule for this so that throughout the week, every student has the opportunity to share.

1575
02:38:00,706 --> 02:38:09,834
Now, not only does this build bonds of a classroom, but it also teaches students how to be active and engaged

1576
02:38:10,487 --> 02:38:19,395
participants, as well as those skills in presenting and listening to feedback from their classmates when they're asking questions.

1577
02:38:20,376 --> 02:38:24,039
The group activity portion has lots of flexibility.

1578
02:38:24,120 --> 02:38:28,824
So it can be seen in an academic activity.

1579
02:38:29,464 --> 02:38:34,729
It could be seen in a game, which is a little bit more fun, the reciting of a poem.

1580
02:38:35,730 --> 02:38:46,319
It could also be seen if you draw your attention to the top picture that was in a fourth grade classroom at the McGlynn school and during their group activity on Fridays.

1581
02:38:46,939 --> 02:38:52,183
It might be more than one day, but you'll see that the students in the in the classroom as well.

1582
02:38:53,064 --> 02:38:58,126
Well, you might not be able to see the students on the screen, but they each have a book of the one that's displayed here.

1583
02:38:59,567 --> 02:39:06,709
And they listen to it collectively as a class, but through audio recording of the story.

1584
02:39:06,869 --> 02:39:11,171
And so this was happening during the group activity portion of morning meeting.

1585
02:39:12,031 --> 02:39:16,574
And then finally is the morning message, which the teacher will write to the students.

1586
02:39:16,774 --> 02:39:24,278
It can contain a riddle or something fun and exciting that's coming up for the day, or it could just be a review of the schedule.

1587
02:39:24,718 --> 02:39:27,279
In the bottom picture, this is a kindergarten at the Brooks.

1588
02:39:27,339 --> 02:39:30,981
You'll see that off to the right a little bit is an easel.

1589
02:39:31,141 --> 02:39:37,725
It does contain the morning message that the teacher will review right before the close of morning meeting.

1590
02:39:39,387 --> 02:39:44,631
I think at this point, I'm gonna send it back to Stacey Shulman to go over the survey results from the staff.

1591
02:39:46,372 --> 02:39:46,852
Thank you.

1592
02:39:47,012 --> 02:39:52,396
So as you can see here, this is a question of how comfortable are you with responsive classroom program?

1593
02:39:52,796 --> 02:39:54,958
And this was towards all of our elementary staff.

1594
02:39:55,118 --> 02:40:01,542
And while we had certainly not all of them participating, I think they're surveyed out at this point a little bit.

1595
02:40:02,543 --> 02:40:07,086
You can see they're feeling quite comfortable with responsive classroom thus far.

1596
02:40:11,126 --> 02:40:12,727
Next slide, yes, please, thanks.

1597
02:40:13,847 --> 02:40:21,930
In terms of running a morning meeting, the bulk, again, are very comfortable running morning meetings at this point, which was nice to see.

1598
02:40:25,472 --> 02:40:29,073
Implementing the first six weeks part of the program, which is a little bit more robust.

1599
02:40:30,053 --> 02:40:39,417
We saw, again, most teachers who responded to the survey felt comfortable doing so, a little bit more trepidation here on this one, so we'll continue working with that.

1600
02:40:41,548 --> 02:40:47,251
The next slide overall is staff comments about responsive classroom.

1601
02:40:47,351 --> 02:40:49,292
And so I won't read all of them to you.

1602
02:40:49,312 --> 02:41:00,518
And the full review of the comments are in the slides notes section, if you have the full slides for our school committee members and like to review them.

1603
02:41:00,978 --> 02:41:08,302
But you can see some of the comments staff made were the time set aside for morning meeting has been crucial to building community and SEL skills.

1604
02:41:09,291 --> 02:41:13,493
The consistent morning routine that builds community has been good for all during remote learning.

1605
02:41:14,393 --> 02:41:16,594
A positive tone right from the start.

1606
02:41:17,695 --> 02:41:23,678
Positive discipline and effective teacher language to build academic engagement were some of the things I will highlight here.

1607
02:41:25,859 --> 02:41:26,719
I'll turn it back to Ms.

1608
02:41:26,739 --> 02:41:29,480
Scalusi for our continued plan.

1609
02:41:30,141 --> 02:41:32,482
Yes, so our next steps are

1610
02:41:34,076 --> 02:41:39,039
Responsive classroom is not just for this COVID academic year.

1611
02:41:39,079 --> 02:41:44,742
Responsive classroom will continue for next year at each elementary school.

1612
02:41:44,843 --> 02:41:53,768
And we will continue to have time built into the schedule so that teachers are able to have a morning meeting with their entire classroom.

1613
02:41:55,289 --> 02:42:02,213
Part of the schedule just for parents that are on this call that may not be aware is that the morning meeting time

1614
02:42:03,159 --> 02:42:22,714
that is built in at the very beginning of the day ensures that the rest of the school schedule in terms of specialists pull out services that starts after the morning meeting time which makes sure that every single student is able to start their day with his or her peers are training and coaching sessions are going to be continued to be provided for staff.

1615
02:42:23,598 --> 02:42:26,020
We are looking to increase the number of trainers.

1616
02:42:26,160 --> 02:42:30,304
So maybe if anyone's interested, they could email Stacey Shulman or myself.

1617
02:42:31,746 --> 02:42:32,847
It's so much fun.

1618
02:42:33,988 --> 02:42:45,118
And then we really would like, we're looking into expanding the training to include the power of our words, which is the piece that I was speaking about before about the language that

1619
02:42:46,412 --> 02:42:51,294
the adults are using when they're having conversations with other adults as well as with the students.

1620
02:42:51,994 --> 02:42:55,975
And then there is more information here at the link for responsive classroom.

1621
02:42:56,396 --> 02:43:09,700
We will post this report to the Medford Public Schools website after this school committee meeting for those at home that want to be able to review the slides and maybe have the link accessible there.

1622
02:43:10,100 --> 02:43:11,041
And Ms.

1623
02:43:11,061 --> 02:43:12,181
Schulman, thank you very much.

1624
02:43:12,221 --> 02:43:12,421
And Ms.

1625
02:43:12,441 --> 02:43:14,742
Schulman and I are ready for any questions that you may have.

1626
02:43:16,525 --> 02:43:17,466
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

1627
02:43:23,114 --> 02:43:24,115
Thank you very much, ladies.

1628
02:43:24,135 --> 02:43:29,362
If there's no questions, we can move on to number five.

1629
02:43:33,224 --> 02:43:35,205
May I remember if Vanderkloot has her hand up?

1630
02:43:35,485 --> 02:43:36,185
Oh, Member Vanderkloot.

1631
02:43:36,645 --> 02:43:39,446
Yeah, I just wanted to thank you for the report.

1632
02:43:39,546 --> 02:43:52,592
I think this is a very positive thing for our students, and I particularly like to see the teachers who responded about how this, even though students may not be in school, it's still pulling them together and creating a community.

1633
02:43:53,392 --> 02:43:53,892
So thank you.

1634
02:43:54,432 --> 02:43:54,792
Thank you.

1635
02:43:54,812 --> 02:43:55,453
Thank you.

1636
02:44:00,455 --> 02:44:00,755
Thank you.

1637
02:44:02,022 --> 02:44:06,222
Number five, recommendation to approve updated bullying prevention plan, Ms.

1638
02:44:06,262 --> 02:44:06,844
Joan Bowen.

1639
02:44:12,371 --> 02:44:12,931
Good evening.

1640
02:44:12,951 --> 02:44:21,334
Tonight I bring forth the recommendation for School Committee to approve the revised Medford Public Schools bullying and intervention plan.

1641
02:44:22,095 --> 02:44:28,757
A task force was created to review and update the Medford Public Schools bullying intervention and prevention plan.

1642
02:44:29,318 --> 02:44:34,980
The members of this task force included Dr. Peter Cushing, Suzanne Galussi,

1643
02:44:35,840 --> 02:44:42,168
Thomas Milicheski, Rachel Perry, Bernadette Riccadeli, Stacey Shulman, and myself.

1644
02:44:43,069 --> 02:44:50,898
The task force utilized and referenced DESI's checklist for required content of a bullying prevention and intervention plans to guide our work.

1645
02:44:51,699 --> 02:45:01,832
The task force reviewed the district's most recent bullying intervention and prevention plan and identified areas to be updated and revised based on the required elements of the checklist.

1646
02:45:02,473 --> 02:45:09,461
Some of these included minor updates and revisions, such as updating the content page, spelling, grammar, and formatting.

1647
02:45:10,488 --> 02:45:15,152
We also identified new areas to be included in the document based on the checklist.

1648
02:45:15,673 --> 02:45:24,000
These additions listed below are also highlighted on the bullying intervention and prevention plan that was provided to you in your school committee packets.

1649
02:45:24,560 --> 02:45:30,786
The following are the additions that we made to the plan based on the recommendations of the task force and the checklist.

1650
02:45:31,599 --> 02:45:40,204
So we added in the Medford Public Schools Health Education Scope and Sequence, which was provided by Rachel Perry, and that's on pages 12 through 17.

1651
02:45:41,025 --> 02:45:54,433
We also included the Problem Resolution System, and that's on page 25, which allows parents to file a complaint with PRS at DESE if they have a complaint about how the bullying investigation was handled.

1652
02:45:55,565 --> 02:46:11,651
We also added the access to resource and services on page 25, which we will be sending out a survey every four years to survey the climate of the students in school, the bullying, how they feel school is handling and make adjustments going forward.

1653
02:46:12,291 --> 02:46:23,515
And then the last pages that we updated and made more user-friendly were pages 28 to 34, which included the bullying report form, the bullying investigation form,

1654
02:46:24,255 --> 02:46:28,579
the behavioral remediation form, and the individual behavioral form.

1655
02:46:29,179 --> 02:46:35,905
So once this is approved, we will remove the highlights from the plan, and we will post it on the Medford Public School website.

1656
02:46:36,345 --> 02:46:43,031
And this will be the plan that will be used to provide our mandated trainings with faculty throughout the school year.

1657
02:46:45,073 --> 02:46:45,473
Thank you.

1658
02:46:46,634 --> 02:46:47,054
Thank you, Ms.

1659
02:46:47,074 --> 02:46:47,415
Bowen.

1660
02:46:47,455 --> 02:46:47,615
Ms.

1661
02:46:47,655 --> 02:46:49,216
McLaughlin, then member Van de Kloet.

1662
02:46:50,317 --> 02:46:52,559
Member McLaughlin, then member Van de Kloet, sorry.

1663
02:46:54,280 --> 02:46:54,720
Thank you.

1664
02:46:55,081 --> 02:46:56,381
Thank you for this report, Ms.

1665
02:46:56,401 --> 02:46:57,002
Bowen.

1666
02:46:57,182 --> 02:47:00,064
I have a few questions, so if you could bear with me, I would appreciate it.

1667
02:47:02,865 --> 02:47:18,095
I guess first and foremost, is there an opportunity to do a single page sheet for, you know, one for, I guess, students, one for staff administration, and one for families that sort of

1668
02:47:18,603 --> 02:47:21,624
I mean, I realize that there's a lot condensed in here.

1669
02:47:21,684 --> 02:47:24,104
It's a, I think roughly 30 page report.

1670
02:47:24,905 --> 02:47:37,268
I fear not a lot of families will go through the material or until it's necessitated because of an experience and then it will be overwhelming.

1671
02:47:38,248 --> 02:47:47,451
So I think it would be really helpful if there was sort of a summary sheet if possible for each of those constituencies.

1672
02:47:49,400 --> 02:47:55,067
families, caregivers, staff, and student.

1673
02:47:56,208 --> 02:47:57,510
That would be really helpful.

1674
02:47:58,263 --> 02:48:00,064
So yeah, that's fine.

1675
02:48:00,224 --> 02:48:03,185
I mean, it is a lot of information in the 34 pages.

1676
02:48:03,245 --> 02:48:03,885
So if we can.

1677
02:48:03,945 --> 02:48:05,006
It's 34 pages.

1678
02:48:05,086 --> 02:48:06,246
I know it's like, that's the thing.

1679
02:48:06,286 --> 02:48:06,987
It's overwhelming.

1680
02:48:07,007 --> 02:48:16,731
So I don't know how you condense 34 onto one, but I mean, maybe just in terms of bullets and sections or something that would be just the most sort of salient thing, I guess.

1681
02:48:16,891 --> 02:48:24,414
And I'm happy to offer input from a parent perspective of what I would want to know on a one page, if you find that you need that.

1682
02:48:25,560 --> 02:48:35,160
I'm happy to offer that and I'm sure that, you know, there must be staff and students out there that would be willing to do the same so I could certainly help to mark and then.

1683
02:48:38,219 --> 02:48:44,503
I noticed that there was a notation for professional development for families around bullying.

1684
02:48:44,643 --> 02:48:49,046
And I'm wondering, and in most of the other instances, Ms.

1685
02:48:49,086 --> 02:48:52,428
Bowen, I did put the page numbers in, but I guess this is when I was first reading it.

1686
02:48:52,468 --> 02:48:55,430
I didn't mention that I didn't get this page number, so I apologize.

1687
02:48:56,551 --> 02:49:01,074
But essentially that it was going to be not professional development for parents, obviously, but basically,

1688
02:49:02,935 --> 02:49:10,717
some development, you know, some presentation, information, what have you, for families on a regular basis.

1689
02:49:10,777 --> 02:49:12,978
And I was wondering if that was accurate.

1690
02:49:13,978 --> 02:49:14,738
Yes, there should be.

1691
02:49:14,778 --> 02:49:20,460
So the last one I believe was April 2019, there was a parent presentation for cyber safety.

1692
02:49:21,404 --> 02:49:26,328
We have to look at what needs to be presented to parents on a yearly basis.

1693
02:49:26,388 --> 02:49:32,572
If it's cyber safety, whatever the topic may be, we would look at doing a presentation for parents.

1694
02:49:32,812 --> 02:49:33,172
Thank you.

1695
02:49:33,212 --> 02:49:48,062
And I guess as part of that, I would ask that there's sort of, and I would assume that there is, but I just, you know, want to put it out there that there's sort of a, you know, open opening reiteration of what the process and policy and procedure is at our public school and our district before.

1696
02:49:48,562 --> 02:49:51,264
you know, a specific presentation on one topic.

1697
02:49:51,324 --> 02:50:05,051
So the broader sort of, you know, knowing what your rights are, knowing, you know, where things stand or, you know, what you can do if you feel like you're not being responded to or things aren't happening in the way that, you know, maybe you think.

1698
02:50:05,531 --> 02:50:08,012
And then Mark, what's the acronym, M-A-R-C?

1699
02:50:08,032 --> 02:50:12,194
Let me see.

1700
02:50:12,535 --> 02:50:13,615
It's Mark Training.

1701
02:50:13,755 --> 02:50:16,717
The Massachusetts Aggression Resource Center.

1702
02:50:17,502 --> 02:50:17,802
Okay.

1703
02:50:18,102 --> 02:50:18,983
And did I miss that?

1704
02:50:19,143 --> 02:50:20,083
Was it spelled out?

1705
02:50:21,624 --> 02:50:24,006
Yes, it's on page four under resources.

1706
02:50:24,406 --> 02:50:24,686
Okay.

1707
02:50:24,926 --> 02:50:27,728
So it was spelled out before it was an acronym?

1708
02:50:28,308 --> 02:50:28,548
Yes.

1709
02:50:28,928 --> 02:50:29,188
Okay.

1710
02:50:29,268 --> 02:50:29,589
Thank you.

1711
02:50:29,609 --> 02:50:31,550
Sorry, I missed it.

1712
02:50:32,370 --> 02:50:39,374
And then, you know, historically, I mean, I thought this report was so comprehensive and I think you guys, I mean, clearly put in a lot of work on this.

1713
02:50:39,414 --> 02:50:40,214
Thank you very much.

1714
02:50:41,095 --> 02:50:44,076
And you could see the timeline sort of, you know,

1715
02:50:45,453 --> 02:50:50,517
events over the years in terms of the bullying and awareness.

1716
02:50:50,677 --> 02:50:54,160
And a lot of them just also feel like sort of one-off events.

1717
02:50:54,420 --> 02:51:13,776
And I'm wondering, as we think about moving forward with these issues, how do we, sort of similar to what we're talking about for anti-racism in our curriculum and what we're talking about for disability awareness embedded in the curriculum and all of those things, how

1718
02:51:14,327 --> 02:51:25,353
we incorporate sort of this idea as well in a way that is not just a one-off event on cyberbullying, but that we have some awareness around our school and schools around bullying.

1719
02:51:25,413 --> 02:51:40,841
And so I don't know if it's, you know, and I'm just sort of putting this out there a little bit, but I'm just thinking that as I was looking, I guess I'm just commenting on when I was looking at the document, it felt like a lot of sort of one-off events and not necessarily sort of an embedded understanding of,

1720
02:51:43,243 --> 02:51:47,185
this idea of the definition of bullying and what it is and, you know, just sort of reinforcement.

1721
02:51:47,205 --> 02:51:55,330
And again, going back to the social emotional piece with the responsive classroom and other aspects that Ms.

1722
02:51:55,710 --> 02:51:59,452
Galussi was talking about, and Stacey was talking, Ms.

1723
02:51:59,472 --> 02:52:03,774
Shulman was talking about sort of how we are thinking about incorporating this idea.

1724
02:52:03,794 --> 02:52:07,396
And I know that that's sort of not necessarily a question that's easily answered.

1725
02:52:07,617 --> 02:52:09,418
So I'm not looking for a response right now.

1726
02:52:09,478 --> 02:52:10,218
I guess I'm just sort of,

1727
02:52:11,280 --> 02:52:15,547
putting that out there to think about and certainly can circle back around on it.

1728
02:52:16,328 --> 02:52:17,690
And then the Michigan model.

1729
02:52:17,970 --> 02:52:20,494
I know you did the responsive classroom just a moment ago.

1730
02:52:20,534 --> 02:52:20,975
Thank you.

1731
02:52:21,816 --> 02:52:24,000
Can you give us a little bit on what the Michigan model is?

1732
02:52:24,895 --> 02:52:33,622
So the Michigan model is, it's a training for K-12 for staff, mostly physical education teachers and health teachers.

1733
02:52:34,263 --> 02:52:45,752
And if you can see that there's the, it talks about internet safety, relationships, there's the whole scope and sequence that we have outlined for you.

1734
02:52:46,132 --> 02:52:50,176
Yeah, there's certain topics that are taught at certain grade levels.

1735
02:52:50,397 --> 02:52:50,577
Yeah.

1736
02:52:51,198 --> 02:53:08,336
So but that sounds like in the responsive classroom too, it sounds like that those are two social emotional programs, but that I'm not, unless I'm mistaken, and please enlighten me, are there specific aspects of those programs that deal with bullying?

1737
02:53:09,050 --> 02:53:09,811
Yes, there are.

1738
02:53:09,971 --> 02:53:10,271
There are.

1739
02:53:10,532 --> 02:53:11,372
Okay.

1740
02:53:11,893 --> 02:53:12,453
Thank you.

1741
02:53:12,514 --> 02:53:19,541
It's building appropriate relationships, safety, that sort of thing.

1742
02:53:19,581 --> 02:53:23,344
So it's a whole comprehensive that does address bullying.

1743
02:53:23,364 --> 02:53:23,625
Yes.

1744
02:53:23,865 --> 02:53:24,886
There's bullying in that.

1745
02:53:24,906 --> 02:53:25,286
Okay.

1746
02:53:27,244 --> 02:53:40,574
That'd be great to see, you know, at some point I'll follow up just on what that piece is, because I'd love to know what that, I'm looking for the word and it's not meeting, I'm not getting it right now, but it's sort of the module, that's it.

1747
02:53:41,075 --> 02:53:42,996
Like if there's a module or piece.

1748
02:53:43,036 --> 02:53:44,317
Part of the curriculum, yep.

1749
02:53:44,517 --> 02:53:50,822
Yep, and then page 21, item two, which I just lost my PowerPoint.

1750
02:53:52,123 --> 02:53:54,244
My page, bear with me one second.

1751
02:53:55,104 --> 02:53:57,585
Page 21 item two.

1752
02:53:57,605 --> 02:54:03,046
Is that about two or more incidents being reported?

1753
02:54:03,066 --> 02:54:03,807
Yes, thank you.

1754
02:54:03,827 --> 02:54:04,867
I was getting down there.

1755
02:54:04,907 --> 02:54:05,827
I'm on 17 now.

1756
02:54:06,167 --> 02:54:08,448
Yes, two or more incidents being reported.

1757
02:54:08,868 --> 02:54:15,250
And so I guess I wanted to know the differentiation between two things and they may tie in together and you know,

1758
02:54:15,810 --> 02:54:19,172
Dr. Cushion should also feel free to jump in if they do.

1759
02:54:19,992 --> 02:54:31,799
But so, you know, from what I'm understanding, and also maybe even like a flowchart, I know that PRS has flowcharts for, and I know that you do obviously, Joan, for the procedural safeguards, we have the flowcharts, what do we do next, what do we do?

1760
02:54:32,119 --> 02:54:35,161
So almost like thinking of this in that fashion for bullying.

1761
02:54:36,731 --> 02:54:46,217
Is there regard, if a student comes to someone and says, I feel like I'm being bullied, is there always an incident report?

1762
02:54:47,317 --> 02:55:02,546
And then it's determined whether the incident report then based on the definition of bullying and whether the individual to whom the incident was reported, I assume, whether that is moved into an investigation report, is that accurate?

1763
02:55:03,404 --> 02:55:03,604
Right?

1764
02:55:03,945 --> 02:55:05,206
So like if you had a yes, no.

1765
02:55:05,266 --> 02:55:11,694
So basically if you're in a flow chart, you know, was the determination made that the student was bullied based on this definition?

1766
02:55:11,734 --> 02:55:12,074
Yes.

1767
02:55:12,234 --> 02:55:12,555
Okay.

1768
02:55:12,595 --> 02:55:16,199
Then next it goes from incident report to investigation report.

1769
02:55:16,259 --> 02:55:16,920
Is that accurate?

1770
02:55:17,360 --> 02:55:18,061
And then if no,

1771
02:55:19,061 --> 02:55:38,575
It's still it's incident report filed right and and there's an incident report where that where that portion stops and you know, once we always recommend anytime the word bullying is used that the the form is provided to the parties to fill out that what starts the investigation right and once we go from there.

1772
02:55:39,108 --> 02:55:41,830
once the investigation is done, what are the next steps?

1773
02:55:42,170 --> 02:55:43,510
Was it found to be bullying?

1774
02:55:43,530 --> 02:55:48,573
Or where do we take the investigation in the next avenue?

1775
02:55:48,693 --> 02:56:08,484
So I don't know, Dr. Cushing, if you want to jump in or... So whenever anyone mentions the word bully, all right, one of the forms that's at the back of the packet, it actually says on the bottom of it that the person receiving the form should make a photocopy of it and give it back with a signature.

1776
02:56:09,022 --> 02:56:15,407
So it stands as like a marker in time for the person who made the report, right?

1777
02:56:15,527 --> 02:56:17,168
And as a measure of accountability.

1778
02:56:18,169 --> 02:56:23,693
And we've also added a significant amount of date tracking in this.

1779
02:56:23,853 --> 02:56:32,139
So these reports should be really date stamped by the person doing them, date stamp when it goes to central office, all these types of things.

1780
02:56:33,220 --> 02:56:36,122
That initial incident report

1781
02:56:36,818 --> 02:56:39,840
should be the start of an investigation, all right?

1782
02:56:40,721 --> 02:56:55,691
And that investigation may be a no-fine bullying, but that report, whenever somebody mentions the word bullying or anything along those lines, and bullying in Massachusetts is actually not its own law, it falls under the criminal harassment law in Massachusetts.

1783
02:56:57,132 --> 02:56:59,533
So that's where it rests and resides.

1784
02:57:02,654 --> 02:57:07,336
that's just something for everyone to be aware of, but we should have a report started at each point.

1785
02:57:08,357 --> 02:57:09,117
Okay, thank you.

1786
02:57:09,157 --> 02:57:26,244
So there is, in other words, whether it's found to be an incidence of bullying or not based on the person who makes that determination, there is some evidence, if you will, of at least a student had felt that they were being bullied.

1787
02:57:26,965 --> 02:57:27,145
Yes.

1788
02:57:27,545 --> 02:57:27,705
Okay.

1789
02:57:28,303 --> 02:57:44,788
And then for the folks who determine from the incident to the investigation, that determination process there, who actually is determining whether this is identified as under the definition of bullying?

1790
02:57:46,008 --> 02:57:46,628
Who would do that?

1791
02:57:47,708 --> 02:57:52,590
Based on the documents you have in front of you, that should be the principal.

1792
02:57:53,650 --> 02:57:53,770
OK.

1793
02:57:55,053 --> 02:57:56,053
And so thank you.

1794
02:57:56,273 --> 02:58:03,976
And so I don't know that, I felt like that maybe, and again, you know, it was a lot of work that you guys did and it was a lot of, it's a lot of pages.

1795
02:58:04,036 --> 02:58:11,099
So I also, again, maybe, you know, Joe and I'm sort of backtracking a little bit, even on the one page.

1796
02:58:11,119 --> 02:58:14,600
Well, I think there could be a narrative on the one page, but certainly a flow chart could be really helpful.

1797
02:58:14,620 --> 02:58:22,343
And maybe that visual would just be really helpful because I think I lost that in there in terms of the principal being the person, but again,

1798
02:58:23,103 --> 02:58:24,063
It was a lot to look at.

1799
02:58:24,123 --> 02:58:24,683
So that's good.

1800
02:58:25,344 --> 02:58:25,804
Thank you.

1801
02:58:25,924 --> 02:58:40,887
And then on page 23, oh, also just going back to the incident report, I assume then Peter, Dr. Cushing, that the, as you said, it's signed and then it's a copy is given to the caregiver family.

1802
02:58:42,188 --> 02:58:43,668
Or whoever the reporting party is.

1803
02:58:44,725 --> 02:58:53,790
It may be a, it may be the caregiver, it may be a teacher, it may be anyone, whoever the reporting party is, that's who it should be given back to.

1804
02:58:54,190 --> 02:58:54,450
Okay.

1805
02:58:54,590 --> 02:58:59,773
And will the student or family be notified if that happens, if they're not the reporting party?

1806
02:59:01,242 --> 02:59:14,484
I would say in the course of investigation, that, you know, natural right right that someone's going to reach out to the family and say hey, I've gotten this report of bullying would you have a chance to come in and discuss.

1807
02:59:15,963 --> 02:59:16,824
Okay, thank you.

1808
02:59:17,364 --> 02:59:22,689
And then on page 23, it says parents will be offered counseling.

1809
02:59:24,311 --> 02:59:30,937
Parent, caregivers and victims will be provided with opportunities for counseling as well aggressors.

1810
02:59:31,438 --> 02:59:35,421
And I'm wondering what is that?

1811
02:59:35,722 --> 02:59:36,763
How does that work?

1812
02:59:38,649 --> 02:59:42,992
Is that a partnership that we have with an outside organization?

1813
02:59:43,072 --> 02:59:45,174
Is that adjustment counselors inside?

1814
02:59:45,554 --> 02:59:47,736
What is that opportunities for counseling?

1815
02:59:49,397 --> 02:59:54,260
So I believe for the students, it would be school adjustment counselors.

1816
02:59:54,280 --> 02:59:55,902
It could be a guidance counselor.

1817
02:59:56,842 --> 02:59:58,564
Parents, we could also look at our

1818
03:00:00,597 --> 03:00:04,301
community partners like Elliott, we would reach out to that.

1819
03:00:04,361 --> 03:00:13,990
We would utilize Stacey Shulman to help identify agencies that could provide counseling to families, but we would try to keep it in house.

1820
03:00:14,250 --> 03:00:22,098
So in case there were issues going on, that the counselor was there for the student at a moment's notice if they needed to speak to them, that sort of thing.

1821
03:00:23,079 --> 03:00:24,079
Okay, thank you.

1822
03:00:26,527 --> 03:00:38,874
And then I know that in page 24 item, actually 3A, but also I was just looking at this 2A as well.

1823
03:00:39,794 --> 03:00:53,362
I know the highlight there is bullying is covered under criminal harassment sections of MGL, especially if this is, I'm assuming this will be posted on our website, obviously with the single pages as well and identifiers, but a link to,

1824
03:00:54,853 --> 03:00:59,854
that citation would be great for the MGL section or what have you.

1825
03:00:59,894 --> 03:01:02,555
So I would just- And also, let me just qualify what I said earlier.

1826
03:01:02,575 --> 03:01:04,455
I said, bullying is not its own law.

1827
03:01:04,495 --> 03:01:05,575
It is, it's chapter 37-0.

1828
03:01:05,675 --> 03:01:22,539
The issue is that the criminal harassment piece is the mechanism, all right, that then allows for law enforcement to become involved because it takes three incidents for something to be considered bullying.

1829
03:01:22,739 --> 03:01:23,279
And it's not,

1830
03:01:25,313 --> 03:01:33,480
You know, I bully, you know, I bully member McLaughlin, I bully member Rousseau, I bully member McStone, I'm a bully.

1831
03:01:33,560 --> 03:01:35,842
It's actually, those are three individual separate events.

1832
03:01:35,882 --> 03:01:38,104
It needs to be three events on the same person.

1833
03:01:38,964 --> 03:01:41,106
And that's according to that law?

1834
03:01:41,587 --> 03:01:41,987
Correct.

1835
03:01:42,367 --> 03:01:42,608
Okay.

1836
03:01:42,968 --> 03:01:52,536
Which is frustrating because, you know, I mean, if you look at the actions of a person, it would be nice to be able to sometimes

1837
03:01:53,233 --> 03:01:56,734
activate these mechanisms to support our students?

1838
03:01:57,534 --> 03:02:13,518
Well, it seems to me that the law is one, one guide, one law, I guess it's the one guide, one guidance of how this can be addressed, but certainly in our capacity as school committee members, we don't have to say it has to be three, right?

1839
03:02:13,678 --> 03:02:19,319
I mean, it seems like we have some latitude in that.

1840
03:02:19,679 --> 03:02:21,800
I think that, I think it's codified in the statute.

1841
03:02:23,404 --> 03:02:25,405
for criminal charges.

1842
03:02:26,286 --> 03:02:26,726
Correct.

1843
03:02:26,826 --> 03:02:33,390
But even in the statute 37-0, bullying is three incidents.

1844
03:02:33,871 --> 03:02:37,433
So you address the behavior as they come up.

1845
03:02:37,473 --> 03:02:53,203
So if somebody comes to you with a first report, if there's nothing else, you investigate it, you give warning, you do your necessary pieces to have interventions to support the aggressor and to help make better choices, to make better decisions, those types of things.

1846
03:02:53,607 --> 03:03:00,690
you know, incident number two happens, that's where, you know, obviously parents of the aggressor have more than likely been involved previously.

1847
03:03:00,710 --> 03:03:18,818
You're then, you know, making sure that your documentation is well squared away, that you're referencing laws, that you're referencing court involvement, that you're having these meetings to make sure that we're reducing the opportunity for harm.

1848
03:03:19,557 --> 03:03:46,060
maybe putting in a safety plan for the target, those types of things that should be going on, that you're making sure that you're doing your full investigations with your written statements of witnesses, all those things to make sure that you are well squared away and that that level of investigation itself oftentimes I found serves as a deterrent once it becomes clear the level that a school is willing to go to.

1849
03:03:47,310 --> 03:03:50,352
to protect targets from aggressive behavior?

1850
03:03:52,313 --> 03:03:53,093
Yeah, I guess so.

1851
03:03:53,113 --> 03:04:12,384
But I mean, for me, it doesn't sound like that's very, you know, if somebody has to do three incidents to one person in order to be classified as, you know, having been a bully in this context, I mean, I think, you know, the harm that's done by the time you get to three incidents is pretty significant, potentially.

1852
03:04:12,484 --> 03:04:14,285
So, you know, that doesn't,

1853
03:04:15,140 --> 03:04:35,696
I mean, I understand that that's Massachusetts law but I think that I guess my question is, is there a latitude with our school committee, and maybe it's something that we refer to the policy subcommittee, where we have some flexibility around, you know, what, what that constitutes because it seems to me to wait till there's three times.

1854
03:04:37,786 --> 03:04:41,992
I don't know, that seems excessive to me, but I have more questions, so if you could bear with me.

1855
03:04:42,072 --> 03:04:44,556
On page 25, Ms.

1856
03:04:44,576 --> 03:04:52,788
Bowen, PRS, Problem Resolution System, I'm assuming that's for all students, not just students with disabilities?

1857
03:04:53,760 --> 03:04:59,245
Correct, that's for any parent that has a complaint that they would like to file with the problem resolution.

1858
03:04:59,645 --> 03:05:00,726
Oh, that's really interesting.

1859
03:05:00,806 --> 03:05:15,298
So as a parent of a student with a disability who has been familiar with PRS over the years, and as the CPAC co-chair would have you, I didn't realize that PRS will take complaints that are outside of the scope of students with disabilities.

1860
03:05:15,788 --> 03:05:21,833
If they, you know, they're desi, so they oversee all things related, you know, educationally.

1861
03:05:21,873 --> 03:05:25,977
So yes, it is an avenue that parents can use.

1862
03:05:26,237 --> 03:05:27,578
Okay, that's good to know.

1863
03:05:28,339 --> 03:05:31,141
And then I assume they do the same thing that they do with students with disabilities.

1864
03:05:32,162 --> 03:05:33,283
They sort of start their own.

1865
03:05:34,004 --> 03:05:35,805
They would start their own investigation.

1866
03:05:36,666 --> 03:05:40,269
You know, both parties would be contacted, you know.

1867
03:05:41,350 --> 03:05:55,983
we'd have to provide documentation of what the complaint is regarding, show that we followed our policies and procedures, what documentation we have to support that, submit it, and then PRS would make their final decision.

1868
03:05:56,183 --> 03:05:56,403
Right.

1869
03:05:56,483 --> 03:06:06,912
And just to clarify, that is the step that's, and again, this is where a flowchart I think is helpful, that is the step that a family, caregiver, student, other individual could take.

1870
03:06:07,564 --> 03:06:16,590
in the event that they felt dissatisfied with what was happening with the school's response to the bullying, not in the event, that's not the first place you go to, it's the place that you go if you feel like it's not right.

1871
03:06:17,170 --> 03:06:19,431
And then, so that's great that you guys included that.

1872
03:06:19,471 --> 03:06:29,618
I'm wondering, was there a reason that you didn't also include the civil rights piece if it's a civil rights issue?

1873
03:06:30,170 --> 03:06:30,770
violation.

1874
03:06:31,291 --> 03:06:42,599
So, you know, under like a 504, you can go, obviously, you wouldn't go, you don't necessarily go to PRS, you might go to the Office of Civil Rights, you go to OCR, whereas, you know, under IEP, you would go to PRS.

1875
03:06:42,999 --> 03:06:51,505
And so in this context, it seems like it could potentially be PRS or OCR, depending on where you're at, right?

1876
03:06:52,026 --> 03:06:53,006
I can look into that.

1877
03:06:53,066 --> 03:06:57,149
I mean, the checklist that Desi had provided us didn't, you know,

1878
03:06:58,968 --> 03:07:05,111
include the civil rights, but I do understand the validity of having it included in the plan.

1879
03:07:05,211 --> 03:07:07,192
So we can look into that.

1880
03:07:07,232 --> 03:07:11,875
And if it needs to be added, we would add that additional information.

1881
03:07:11,895 --> 03:07:12,975
Thank you.

1882
03:07:13,115 --> 03:07:15,736
And so DESI provided, did DESI put PRS on theirs?

1883
03:07:17,317 --> 03:07:17,557
Yes.

1884
03:07:17,898 --> 03:07:18,178
Oh, good.

1885
03:07:18,298 --> 03:07:18,558
Okay.

1886
03:07:18,678 --> 03:07:20,259
Thank you.

1887
03:07:21,079 --> 03:07:23,280
And then let me see process by which, oh yeah.

1888
03:07:23,560 --> 03:07:25,421
So two final questions.

1889
03:07:27,099 --> 03:07:37,708
And then I guess I'll put it to my colleagues to consider if they have questions as well to consider whether this is something that's further refined to the policy subcommittee.

1890
03:07:38,109 --> 03:07:55,128
But the other questions are, last two questions are, I thought this document was really helpful, although again, really dense because there's so much to convey around if a student is feeling bullied by a student, but it didn't, unless I missed it, again, I could very well have missed it.

1891
03:07:55,589 --> 03:07:58,272
I didn't necessarily see anything in the documentation that was

1892
03:07:59,378 --> 03:08:08,542
addressing whether a student or if a student felt bullied by a staff member or an administrator or a teacher or anything to that degree.

1893
03:08:09,083 --> 03:08:09,703
Am I wrong?

1894
03:08:09,723 --> 03:08:19,288
I believe it's, if a student is bullied by anyone, this is the course of action that they take.

1895
03:08:19,848 --> 03:08:20,048
Yeah.

1896
03:08:20,708 --> 03:08:24,050
So I think that that's, if we could be a little more explicit about that.

1897
03:08:24,130 --> 03:08:27,952
So in terms of the guidance around, you know,

1898
03:08:28,981 --> 03:08:33,886
Because for the way that it reads for me, for a lot of it, it's student on student.

1899
03:08:34,106 --> 03:08:36,828
And obviously, that's terrible.

1900
03:08:38,670 --> 03:08:48,239
But I do think that there's instances, certainly, where there can be, unfortunately, adult on student and perhaps student on adult.

1901
03:08:48,639 --> 03:08:49,000
I don't know.

1902
03:08:49,060 --> 03:08:52,483
So thinking about these other contexts are ways that

1903
03:08:53,111 --> 03:09:01,424
maybe it's in the narrative or in the flow charter, both, where we're making it really explicit that, you know, bullying can happen to any degree.

1904
03:09:01,444 --> 03:09:04,509
And I don't think people generally think of that.

1905
03:09:05,330 --> 03:09:07,414
But certainly, I think if we reflect on our own

1906
03:09:08,289 --> 03:09:20,454
perhaps if we reflect on our own experience, we might recall some examples where, you know, that was outside of the, the bullying was outside of the sort of standard application, I guess.

1907
03:09:21,434 --> 03:09:26,436
So I would just encourage some, some explicitness around that.

1908
03:09:26,756 --> 03:09:30,497
And then what is the process by which school, this is my last question.

1909
03:09:30,877 --> 03:09:37,480
So what is the process by which school committee is made aware of bullying investigations?

1910
03:09:38,347 --> 03:09:58,351
I guess incident reports, I guess both incident reports and investigation, because it would be interesting to know, you know, if we have, for example, say, you know, 20 incident reports at a particular school or 50 for that matter, at a particular school and never an investigation report, that could be interesting data, right?

1911
03:09:58,451 --> 03:10:00,372
So I guess, is there a process by which

1912
03:10:03,322 --> 03:10:10,546
there's either annual or biannual data updating the school committee.

1913
03:10:11,507 --> 03:10:30,197
So I think that the individual incident reports would be confidential student information, both with a potential discipline, but I think that, I don't want to say a dashboard, but some type of a report per school

1914
03:10:30,909 --> 03:10:35,110
maybe per grade level, something along those lines.

1915
03:10:35,270 --> 03:10:50,835
I know last year we stressed quite a bit toward the end of the year before, actually toward the end of the year before the closure, we were being quite adamant about the use of the reporting forms and the reporting to central office.

1916
03:10:51,536 --> 03:10:58,398
So now having that information well-known to our principals and their assistant principals

1917
03:10:59,838 --> 03:11:02,380
And with some training that we're working on getting in place.

1918
03:11:04,401 --> 03:11:11,186
I don't see any reason why we can't prepare an annual or or a semi annual report.

1919
03:11:12,107 --> 03:11:13,868
Yeah, I mean, I think that would be really helpful.

1920
03:11:13,908 --> 03:11:19,012
And again, I'm not looking to, you know, dig deep into any data that would be

1921
03:11:19,880 --> 03:11:29,144
Revealing of anybody's identity, we wouldn't want that, but certainly we can get numbers per school so that we're getting some identification of, you know, of that data.

1922
03:11:30,184 --> 03:11:38,488
And then I know the training that you were saying in terms of, yeah, oh, and I would also just encourage that

1923
03:11:39,748 --> 03:11:51,454
every school has consistently in their handbook, you know, that there's bullying, obviously there's bullying information and perhaps the link to the full 30 page document.

1924
03:11:52,034 --> 03:12:08,943
But also I think part of, I know historically what I've seen as an issue for families is that they're not aware that an incident report is supposed to be filed when there's an allegation and even at an allegation level, not at an investigation level, but even at an allegation level.

1925
03:12:09,403 --> 03:12:11,204
and that they should be aware of that.

1926
03:12:11,344 --> 03:12:34,099
And so I think that thinking about how are we actually making family caregivers aware that that should happen is really critical and not that they have to go to a 30-page document on our website to find out or even the one-page document cover on the website to find out, but that this information is being pushed to them, I think would be really important.

1927
03:12:35,089 --> 03:12:37,931
And I think that's where the summary sheet will come in.

1928
03:12:38,111 --> 03:12:47,817
So it will be very short, what the necessary steps are, and then if they need further information, who to contact or where they can find the information on the website.

1929
03:12:48,298 --> 03:12:48,738
Absolutely.

1930
03:12:48,758 --> 03:12:59,065
And then if that could be applied to each of the student handbooks for each of the schools and or websites, even the one page with a link would be really helpful.

1931
03:12:59,565 --> 03:13:01,046
So thank you for your hard work on this.

1932
03:13:01,086 --> 03:13:02,007
I really appreciate it.

1933
03:13:02,027 --> 03:13:04,068
You're welcome.

1934
03:13:04,792 --> 03:13:05,112
Mayor?

1935
03:13:05,673 --> 03:13:06,874
Yes, Member van de Kloet.

1936
03:13:08,495 --> 03:13:09,296
A couple of things.

1937
03:13:09,836 --> 03:13:17,463
First of all, I want to express my gratitude for the extensive amount of work in putting this together and updating it.

1938
03:13:18,223 --> 03:13:19,244
I really appreciate it.

1939
03:13:19,264 --> 03:13:22,067
They're very comprehensive report.

1940
03:13:23,328 --> 03:13:32,596
Specifically, on page 28 on the form itself, bullying incident reporting form, I see that it says date of report.

1941
03:13:33,628 --> 03:13:39,452
but I don't see a line that says date of incident or even date of alleged incident.

1942
03:13:40,113 --> 03:13:45,857
And so a report could be made six days afterwards.

1943
03:13:46,337 --> 03:13:50,760
I think we should clarify what the date is.

1944
03:13:51,120 --> 03:13:56,064
Now, perhaps it does exist someplace, or maybe you just assume that somebody would write it in.

1945
03:13:56,564 --> 03:14:00,287
But just in case, to me, that just stood out.

1946
03:14:01,714 --> 03:14:03,656
Peter, do you want to talk to that?

1947
03:14:03,696 --> 03:14:07,219
No, I actually accidentally closed out the tab, so it's just reopening.

1948
03:14:08,279 --> 03:14:13,203
Just let me get to the form real quick, and I can actually either clarify or make the addition right now.

1949
03:14:13,223 --> 03:14:14,745
OK.

1950
03:14:15,485 --> 03:14:23,011
The next thing I want to speak to is that when I see the page and I'm flipping back about notifications, there's not a timeline.

1951
03:14:23,091 --> 03:14:26,013
And I'm concerned that there aren't timelines put into this.

1952
03:14:26,814 --> 03:14:29,276
Notify parents, caregiver of the target.

1953
03:14:31,033 --> 03:14:32,034
When does that happen?

1954
03:14:32,734 --> 03:14:42,879
I mean, you know, all of a sudden, you know, when the investigative report, I sort of, I think that we, that we need to be clear.

1955
03:14:43,039 --> 03:14:47,221
And I understand timelines are tricky because there's holidays, there's weekends, there's whatever.

1956
03:14:48,142 --> 03:14:54,305
But yet without any timeline, you kind of take away some level of teeth to this.

1957
03:14:55,343 --> 03:15:05,502
Now, my colleague Melanie brought up many good reports and I really do like the idea of a simple one page thing, a summary, in some ways.

1958
03:15:06,602 --> 03:15:14,606
But the other thing which makes me a little bit nervous is that because this is so comprehensive, I'm not really comfortable just approving it tonight.

1959
03:15:14,826 --> 03:15:26,291
And normally I would expect that this would go, and I know nobody wants to have another meeting, but normally I would expect it to go to rules and regulations or whatever policy.

1960
03:15:27,892 --> 03:15:29,713
So rather than just approving it,

1961
03:15:30,207 --> 03:15:44,295
If we're not gonna send it there, and I don't know the will of the committee, I would suggest we lay it on the table and we have updates, the one page update added to it before our approval at the next meeting.

1962
03:15:44,355 --> 03:15:53,000
But I would like to, I'm not gonna make the motion, I'd like my colleagues to weigh in and let me know what their comfort level is.

1963
03:15:55,001 --> 03:15:55,241
Peter.

1964
03:15:55,641 --> 03:15:58,703
Member Van de Kool, would I be able to offer a suggestion

1965
03:15:59,548 --> 03:16:13,993
Um, as this now has the problem resolution in it and as well as some new updates, um, would we be able to approve it as is with the understanding that it is also going to be sent to say the rules committee, as you mentioned, or, or whatever committee it is.

1966
03:16:14,854 --> 03:16:19,495
Um, but I would like to, um, at least get the problem resolution.

1967
03:16:19,515 --> 03:16:21,916
Um, we've updated these forms considerably.

1968
03:16:21,936 --> 03:16:26,078
Um, and you know, that it is, it is approved.

1969
03:16:26,988 --> 03:16:31,429
I don't want to say tentatively, but approved, understanding that it will also go to a subcommittee.

1970
03:16:36,510 --> 03:16:40,591
Yeah, that's kind of an unusual way for a school committee to do business.

1971
03:16:42,051 --> 03:16:50,753
I mean, because part of me would say that you'd certainly be following this better policy.

1972
03:16:52,333 --> 03:16:55,174
But I guess I'm comfortable with that.

1973
03:16:57,224 --> 03:16:59,285
What about the timelines issue?

1974
03:17:00,205 --> 03:17:02,705
I'm happy also to work on that in the interim.

1975
03:17:04,806 --> 03:17:21,669
And to even expand the, one of the things in redesigning these forms that in speaking to others and having worked on a front and back page form is I want to give the investigating party more space to work with.

1976
03:17:22,029 --> 03:17:24,550
So I also don't have a problem adding pages to it.

1977
03:17:25,163 --> 03:17:30,685
to add those timelines in and to research out other timelines that may be out there.

1978
03:17:31,226 --> 03:17:31,506
OK.

1979
03:17:31,646 --> 03:17:33,627
And to add the date of the incident.

1980
03:17:34,467 --> 03:17:34,647
Yes.

1981
03:17:35,487 --> 03:17:44,091
And I would have said that that should be, say, in the body text on page 29, where it says, please describe the details.

1982
03:17:44,571 --> 03:17:49,333
But I definitely think that a line in there that actually says date of incident

1983
03:17:49,946 --> 03:17:54,950
Well, I would like to see it where it says date of report.

1984
03:17:55,270 --> 03:17:55,610
Let's see.

1985
03:17:55,630 --> 03:17:58,192
I have to find the page again.

1986
03:17:58,212 --> 03:17:59,053
It might be 28.

1987
03:17:59,373 --> 03:17:59,633
Yeah.

1988
03:18:00,634 --> 03:18:03,235
I'm looking for it.

1989
03:18:03,256 --> 03:18:03,235
26, 27.

1990
03:18:03,356 --> 03:18:05,057
Here we go.

1991
03:18:05,777 --> 03:18:16,345
Where it says date of report, right underneath that, if you move that up rather than making it, it should say date of incident or date.

1992
03:18:16,365 --> 03:18:17,946
It could be dates, actually.

1993
03:18:19,703 --> 03:18:23,088
Anyway, I see some of my colleagues have their hands up, so I'd like them to weigh in.

1994
03:18:23,609 --> 03:18:27,656
Yes, Member Kretz, Member Graham, Member McLaughlin, Member Russo.

1995
03:18:28,990 --> 03:18:33,592
Yes, I just want to thank the team for all your hard work and efforts.

1996
03:18:34,012 --> 03:18:36,833
It's a very comprehensive report, just like everybody said.

1997
03:18:36,893 --> 03:18:39,855
And I don't want to repeat some of the things that were said.

1998
03:18:39,935 --> 03:18:42,016
And my colleagues had very good questions.

1999
03:18:42,276 --> 03:18:46,097
And I just, when reading through it, I was thinking the same thing.

2000
03:18:46,117 --> 03:18:50,379
A summary, I came up with the checklist, but a summary is fine.

2001
03:18:50,899 --> 03:18:53,880
So I was thinking the same thing, because it was such a very big report.

2002
03:18:55,601 --> 03:18:59,083
When I was reading through it, I just have it here myself.

2003
03:18:59,163 --> 03:18:59,603
One second.

2004
03:18:59,663 --> 03:19:00,763
Oh, here we go.

2005
03:19:00,843 --> 03:19:15,109
So I just wanted to, you know, just to clarify, and I think this is what it means, because we hear a lot about cyberbullying, and, you know, that's really common with the internet and the different social media tools that we have out there.

2006
03:19:15,589 --> 03:19:20,631
So does on page 19, the definition of

2007
03:19:22,272 --> 03:19:25,833
you know, regarding technological cyberbullying.

2008
03:19:26,253 --> 03:19:39,218
So it does mention something that it would, something that does bullying that occurs on or off school, cyberbullying from a home computer or mobile device, if that bullying occurs in a hostile environment for the subject.

2009
03:19:39,558 --> 03:19:47,261
So does that incorporate, you know, if somebody was, you know, getting bullied on social media sites, things like that?

2010
03:19:48,061 --> 03:19:50,843
That's that's what I assume that but I just wanted to clarify that.

2011
03:19:50,883 --> 03:19:52,564
Yes, that's what exactly what it means.

2012
03:19:52,644 --> 03:19:52,804
Yep.

2013
03:19:53,464 --> 03:19:54,284
Okay, thank you.

2014
03:19:55,145 --> 03:19:55,685
And thank you.

2015
03:19:56,426 --> 03:20:05,130
And I would be, I would be okay, I would be comfortable approving it tonight with the recommended changes that were mentioned.

2016
03:20:05,530 --> 03:20:08,072
I just wanted to mention that to Ms.

2017
03:20:08,092 --> 03:20:08,552
Van de Kloot.

2018
03:20:13,363 --> 03:20:14,683
Thank you, member Kratz.

2019
03:20:15,164 --> 03:20:19,045
I just want to thank Mr. Bailey, Colin, for being on.

2020
03:20:19,125 --> 03:20:22,086
I know you have to get to do some homework.

2021
03:20:22,386 --> 03:20:25,287
Sorry it's so late, but thank you for being with us.

2022
03:20:26,007 --> 03:20:28,368
Yes, I was just about to send a private message.

2023
03:20:28,388 --> 03:20:31,209
I just want to thank you all for your gracious acceptance.

2024
03:20:32,129 --> 03:20:38,211
I really, really appreciate being here and I can't wait to show up to the next meeting and add more of a student's perspective.

2025
03:20:38,611 --> 03:20:39,172
That'd be great.

2026
03:20:39,192 --> 03:20:40,192
Thank you all once again.

2027
03:20:40,732 --> 03:20:40,992
Thank you.

2028
03:20:41,012 --> 03:20:41,232
Thank you.

2029
03:20:43,917 --> 03:20:44,257
You too.

2030
03:20:44,277 --> 03:20:45,918
I did see David sign on.

2031
03:20:45,998 --> 03:20:50,400
I'm not sure if he's still on, but he did sign on about 6.30 or so.

2032
03:20:50,460 --> 03:20:51,781
So thank you for being here, David.

2033
03:20:52,762 --> 03:21:00,146
Next up is member Graham.

2034
03:21:00,766 --> 03:21:01,626
Just a couple of things.

2035
03:21:01,646 --> 03:21:10,471
I would be fine with approving this document in the interim with an expectation that the rules policy and equity subcommittee

2036
03:21:11,318 --> 03:21:12,698
and look at this in more detail.

2037
03:21:12,798 --> 03:21:31,084
And specifically there are references to out-of-school suspension in here, which I think need a look in the larger context based on the work we are doing over the course of between now and the end of the school year to prepare and put systems in place to end out-of-school suspensions.

2038
03:21:33,085 --> 03:21:39,247
I tried to get to some of the links that were in here and some of them are broken in that reference section.

2039
03:21:39,989 --> 03:21:48,812
So I don't know if it's just my copy, but I was unable to particularly to get to that mark link at all.

2040
03:21:51,253 --> 03:22:01,137
And the other thing that I've been sort of thinking about as it relates to this certainly is, you know,

2041
03:22:01,954 --> 03:22:02,554
And then there was also.

2042
03:22:02,594 --> 03:22:07,197
Some of the summary reporting that was referenced earlier as well as.

2043
03:22:08,117 --> 03:22:10,018
Having some systemic way to.

2044
03:22:11,119 --> 03:22:13,720
To report things other than just forms.

2045
03:22:15,061 --> 03:22:20,784
And then there was also sort of a question for me that we can talk more about in the,

2046
03:22:28,252 --> 03:22:33,214
It's a, it's a long review cycle for something that feels like it changes somewhat rapidly.

2047
03:22:34,375 --> 03:22:37,296
Certainly, if we purchased curriculum back in 2010 I think.

2048
03:22:39,885 --> 03:22:44,748
It may bear another look to say, is this really the right thing?

2049
03:22:44,808 --> 03:22:46,429
And do we have the right structures in place?

2050
03:22:46,849 --> 03:22:52,613
And then there was also reference in the document to a memorandum of agreement with the Medford Police Department.

2051
03:22:52,693 --> 03:22:58,797
And I would like a copy of that as we think about reviewing all of this with the Rules Policy and Equity Subcommittee.

2052
03:23:07,362 --> 03:23:07,722
Thank you.

2053
03:23:07,802 --> 03:23:08,783
Member McLaughlin.

2054
03:23:11,155 --> 03:23:11,596
Thank you.

2055
03:23:11,616 --> 03:23:27,249
I was just going to add that I was also okay with the, you know, this being posted to be updated ASAP with the understanding that, again, the referral to the Rules, Policy and Equity Subcommittee.

2056
03:23:27,890 --> 03:23:29,611
And then I wanted to further

2057
03:23:32,517 --> 03:23:39,021
I guess ask Joan for maybe an additional link or something along those lines around manifestation of disability.

2058
03:23:39,882 --> 03:23:54,911
So for folks that are watching, there's a whole thing that if the behavior is a manifestation of the student's disability, it takes another course in the flow chart, if you will.

2059
03:23:54,971 --> 03:23:58,053
So how that is understood would be helpful.

2060
03:23:59,142 --> 03:24:11,314
And I believe there is something in the document regarding that, but we might need to make it a little more descriptive for parents of students with disabilities.

2061
03:24:11,614 --> 03:24:20,282
Yeah, and also for teachers and staff that don't have experience with disability and don't necessarily understand.

2062
03:24:20,662 --> 03:24:23,945
So there was a mention of it in there, and there was a referral to, I think, ETL.

2063
03:24:25,248 --> 03:24:30,670
Um, to determine whether it was a manifestation of disability, but I think just a little, you know, something.

2064
03:24:30,710 --> 03:24:35,632
And then even, I don't know if it's in the appendix manifestation of disability or not, but with a link would be really helpful.

2065
03:24:36,052 --> 03:24:36,312
Sure.

2066
03:24:36,672 --> 03:24:37,012
Thank you.

2067
03:24:43,995 --> 03:24:44,455
Member Rousseau.

2068
03:24:48,905 --> 03:24:49,345
Thank you.

2069
03:24:50,726 --> 03:24:59,733
So I'd like to make a motion to approve this and to send this to the Race, Policy and Equity Subcommittee meeting for review and additional recommendations.

2070
03:24:59,753 --> 03:25:01,834
Second.

2071
03:25:05,557 --> 03:25:06,357
Shall I take the roll?

2072
03:25:06,758 --> 03:25:09,279
Motion for approval by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

2073
03:25:09,319 --> 03:25:09,720
Roll call.

2074
03:25:11,141 --> 03:25:11,721
Jenny Graham?

2075
03:25:12,121 --> 03:25:12,321
Yes.

2076
03:25:12,862 --> 03:25:13,482
Kathy Kretz?

2077
03:25:14,003 --> 03:25:14,203
Yes.

2078
03:25:14,683 --> 03:25:15,504
Melanie McLaughlin?

2079
03:25:16,391 --> 03:25:16,711
Yes.

2080
03:25:17,091 --> 03:25:17,752
Mia Mastone?

2081
03:25:18,052 --> 03:25:18,372
Yes.

2082
03:25:18,812 --> 03:25:19,433
Paul Rousseau?

2083
03:25:19,993 --> 03:25:20,233
Yes.

2084
03:25:20,633 --> 03:25:21,434
Paulette Vanderkloot?

2085
03:25:21,454 --> 03:25:21,734
Yes.

2086
03:25:21,914 --> 03:25:22,694
Mayor Lungo Kern?

2087
03:25:23,115 --> 03:25:23,315
Yes.

2088
03:25:23,335 --> 03:25:24,896
Seven affirmative, zero in the negative.

2089
03:25:25,136 --> 03:25:30,439
The paper passes and will be referred to the subcommittee on rules policy.

2090
03:25:31,699 --> 03:25:32,620
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

2091
03:25:33,500 --> 03:25:34,541
Thank you all for your hard work.

2092
03:25:34,701 --> 03:25:34,941
Yes.

2093
03:25:35,562 --> 03:25:36,262
Much appreciated.

2094
03:25:38,115 --> 03:25:40,036
I'm not sure I don't communications.

2095
03:25:40,056 --> 03:25:42,498
I know we have new business.

2096
03:25:44,360 --> 03:25:55,908
Motion by Member Rousseau, receive and discuss a recommendation from the superintendent on how to handle snow days in light of the altered model of educational delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic.

2097
03:25:56,248 --> 03:25:56,808
Member Rousseau.

2098
03:25:59,791 --> 03:26:00,191
Thank you.

2099
03:26:00,711 --> 03:26:02,192
I know I have received numerous

2100
03:26:04,097 --> 03:26:15,000
queries from the public and teachers and parents about what are we going to do with snow days because the Department of Ed has sort of given us the freedom to do whatever we want with them this year.

2101
03:26:16,420 --> 03:26:29,423
And certain districts are taking the approach of doing away with them and turning them all into remote, full remote days if the superintendent determines that it's not safe to come to school or

2102
03:26:30,968 --> 03:26:48,694
And then I've also heard from parents that are interested in, well, if it's a really bad day, do we want the kids to have to just sit on the computers all day or do we want them to actually go out and go sledding or dig out the snow if they should have that option?

2103
03:26:48,774 --> 03:26:56,017
But yeah, so I think that it's clear that there's an expectation that we have a new policy or a policy decision on this.

2104
03:26:56,897 --> 03:26:59,678
MASC, the Mass Association of School Committees did,

2105
03:27:00,473 --> 03:27:04,175
tell us that we should make a determination what we'll do.

2106
03:27:04,195 --> 03:27:09,078
I don't feel particularly strongly in any direction on this.

2107
03:27:09,359 --> 03:27:11,480
And in fact, there may be a middle ground somewhere.

2108
03:27:11,500 --> 03:27:18,845
And I was hoping that the superintendent could really lay down her thoughts so that we can hopefully all just agree to it.

2109
03:27:23,162 --> 03:27:37,823
In terms of this year, this year, having the opportunity to be able to function remotely, if necessary, that is wonderful to be able to do, but in the event that we were to have a

2110
03:27:39,999 --> 03:27:49,870
repeat of like the blizzard of 78 where it was a true state of emergency for the entire state, then we would have to look at things differently.

2111
03:27:49,930 --> 03:27:56,016
But if it's something where the amount of snow that we had over the weekend where it was only, you know,

2112
03:27:57,148 --> 03:27:58,889
two inches or three inches of snow.

2113
03:28:00,971 --> 03:28:11,718
If we're able to get the buildings, the school buildings, the parking lots plowed, as in the past, then school would be in session.

2114
03:28:11,838 --> 03:28:16,461
I mean, as it is right now, where the school year has been abbreviated to 170 days,

2115
03:28:19,556 --> 03:28:24,759
I would try my best to provide students with the most consistency as possible.

2116
03:28:26,220 --> 03:28:41,871
But if it is something where, you know, the conditions are dangerous, no one should be driving, the highways cannot be cleared, and it's, you know, an incredible amount of snow, then we definitely would make an appropriate decision.

2117
03:28:42,031 --> 03:28:47,195
But as you know, you know, each day that we,

2118
03:28:48,935 --> 03:28:54,799
declare as an official snow day and not a school day gets added on at the end of the year.

2119
03:28:55,380 --> 03:29:16,215
And so we definitely, if we can avoid extending the school year so that this summer people will be able to enjoy the warmer weather for the short period of time that we have, I would really try not to abuse the option of a snow day.

2120
03:29:17,556 --> 03:29:18,117
I don't know if that,

2121
03:29:20,515 --> 03:29:22,777
provides greater clarity, Mr. Russo, let me know.

2122
03:29:22,797 --> 03:29:33,067
I certainly think it makes it, for me, it's clear that you'll call a snow day if it should be a snow day.

2123
03:29:33,908 --> 03:29:37,010
In some districts, they're literally saying there will be no snow days.

2124
03:29:37,131 --> 03:29:42,716
We can have the blizzard for 76 and teachers will be expected to just teach their kids at home remotely.

2125
03:29:43,269 --> 03:29:45,391
no matter what cohort they were in.

2126
03:29:45,911 --> 03:29:53,096
And that, I think, is concerning, because as somebody did recently mention, kids have lost enough.

2127
03:29:53,576 --> 03:29:55,578
Why can't they just have a snow day and go sledding?

2128
03:29:56,378 --> 03:29:59,941
And I think that's a pretty fair statement.

2129
03:29:59,981 --> 03:30:10,368
I mean, hopefully, we do not have what we had, the Snowmageddon or whatever it was called a few years back, where it's just the whole month of February is no school, which was a different problem.

2130
03:30:10,408 --> 03:30:11,229
But thank you.

2131
03:30:12,069 --> 03:30:12,149
OK.

2132
03:30:12,690 --> 03:30:12,970
Thank you.

2133
03:30:16,014 --> 03:30:18,865
So nothing to approve, but I appreciate it.

2134
03:30:18,925 --> 03:30:20,109
Oh, I'm sorry, Memocrats.

2135
03:30:23,942 --> 03:30:25,083
I just had a thought.

2136
03:30:25,363 --> 03:30:38,388
I was just thinking about how we've had a late start, like a two-hour late start, where I know the storm didn't have measurable amount of snow on Saturday.

2137
03:30:38,408 --> 03:30:40,929
It was still dangerous driving.

2138
03:30:40,949 --> 03:30:43,510
There was whiteout conditions.

2139
03:30:43,810 --> 03:30:47,852
So I was thinking, because I know that if we have a late start,

2140
03:30:49,232 --> 03:30:52,655
And we're still getting the parking lots ready to open up.

2141
03:30:54,436 --> 03:30:56,517
Would something like that still be possible?

2142
03:30:56,537 --> 03:31:06,724
Even if, let's say, families are home and their students are remote, they still might need to get their cars cleared off in case of an emergency.

2143
03:31:07,204 --> 03:31:10,567
just to get out of their house on a particular day.

2144
03:31:11,027 --> 03:31:15,830
I was thinking it could still affect people who are remote and who are hybrid.

2145
03:31:15,951 --> 03:31:22,896
I was just thinking about it overall because you just never know when you're going to have to rush out the door for something.

2146
03:31:23,716 --> 03:31:25,918
I was just thinking about that as a late start.

2147
03:31:25,958 --> 03:31:29,621
Does that affect the end of the year number of school days?

2148
03:31:31,849 --> 03:31:39,772
When you have a late start, a delay, it does not affect the total number of school days.

2149
03:31:41,232 --> 03:31:53,436
In terms of a late start, I would probably think about something like that for school year 21-22, and not this particular school year where there have been so many shifts.

2150
03:31:55,797 --> 03:32:06,565
with calling a snow day, working with transportation, again, the DPW, they have to do all of the hospitals, the police, the fire stations.

2151
03:32:07,106 --> 03:32:10,969
They have to do the first responders first, and then they come to the schools.

2152
03:32:11,029 --> 03:32:17,153
So there is an order in which the roads are plowed, the key main roads are plowed.

2153
03:32:17,674 --> 03:32:22,898
But I mean, if it's a storm where people are losing power and electricity,

2154
03:32:23,478 --> 03:32:27,939
and those kinds of things, it probably would have to be an official snow day.

2155
03:32:28,499 --> 03:32:36,541
And then although the majority of all of our students live in Medford, but not all of our staff live in Medford.

2156
03:32:36,861 --> 03:32:42,382
So we have people commuting in to schools from different parts of the state.

2157
03:32:43,143 --> 03:32:47,164
Most people are in a reasonable distance.

2158
03:32:47,844 --> 03:32:52,225
So it would be looking at the conditions and what's happening

2159
03:32:54,266 --> 03:33:00,030
Again, they were talking 10 inches of snow over the weekend, but Medford didn't get 10 inches.

2160
03:33:00,630 --> 03:33:09,896
Other places just got a lot of, so it's something that we'll have to wait and see, but my preference would be for us to be in school.

2161
03:33:10,396 --> 03:33:19,903
But again, if there's truly a state of emergency or a very valid, valid reason, then we would do that.

2162
03:33:23,330 --> 03:33:23,710
Thank you.

2163
03:33:23,870 --> 03:33:24,291
Thank you.

2164
03:33:24,391 --> 03:33:29,494
And I know how closely you monitor the forecast and work with the different administrators.

2165
03:33:29,535 --> 03:33:31,096
So I really appreciate everything you've done.

2166
03:33:31,556 --> 03:33:36,059
I was the vice chair last year and I got some calls from you.

2167
03:33:36,099 --> 03:33:42,044
So I was actively involved with everything that you do to make that decision.

2168
03:33:42,144 --> 03:33:45,886
So I appreciate what you do making that decision.

2169
03:33:45,946 --> 03:33:48,508
It's a tough decision and you always make the right choice.

2170
03:33:48,568 --> 03:33:48,949
Thank you.

2171
03:33:49,669 --> 03:33:50,150
Thank you.

2172
03:33:50,530 --> 03:33:56,797
I just want to quickly reply that I received national weather notification.

2173
03:33:57,778 --> 03:34:00,581
And so the superintendents do receive that.

2174
03:34:00,721 --> 03:34:04,885
So it's in addition to what's on the regular news that they kind of give us

2175
03:34:07,642 --> 03:34:08,842
updates periodically.

2176
03:34:08,922 --> 03:34:11,683
So we rely heavily on that information.

2177
03:34:12,204 --> 03:34:25,868
And then I also consult and work with neighboring districts and neighboring other superintendents when it comes to how communities within our area are impacted.

2178
03:34:27,209 --> 03:34:27,609
Thank you.

2179
03:34:30,210 --> 03:34:30,470
Thank you.

2180
03:34:32,048 --> 03:34:40,070
I'm offered by member Graham, whereas the COVID school closures and associated budget impacts this spring delay the school committee's annual process.

2181
03:34:40,731 --> 03:34:53,795
Viewers of the school committee, the superintendent's performance evaluations for the 2019-2020 academic year, no later than December 31st, 2020.

2182
03:34:56,567 --> 03:35:08,795
whereas defined goals are the foundation for productive evaluation of the superintendent be it resolved that the school committee establish goals for the superintendent for the 2020-2021 academic year no later than December 31st, 2020.

2183
03:35:08,995 --> 03:35:10,837
Member Graham.

2184
03:35:13,699 --> 03:35:24,306
Yeah, so I just, before time continues to slip away, I think it's important for us to do the superintendent's evaluation, which was delayed last spring.

2185
03:35:25,587 --> 03:35:39,782
for the 19-20 academic year because she does not have an evaluation on file from us, and nor have we established any goals this year so that we can do this process again at the end of this school year.

2186
03:35:40,182 --> 03:35:43,806
And, you know, she is our only direct report.

2187
03:35:47,454 --> 03:35:48,054
as a committee.

2188
03:35:48,074 --> 03:35:54,917
And so if we are not providing her written evaluation, we're not upholding our end of her employment agreement.

2189
03:35:54,957 --> 03:36:07,821
So I wanna make sure that we respect that process and give her the feedback that she deserves from us and that we have a good discussion about goals for the upcoming school year.

2190
03:36:09,242 --> 03:36:09,602
Thank you.

2191
03:36:09,722 --> 03:36:10,562
Member Van de Kloot.

2192
03:36:11,690 --> 03:36:19,393
I believe that the first piece of that is that the superintendent would supply the school committee with a self evaluation and I

2193
03:36:23,540 --> 03:36:41,472
certainly support that it's important for us to do the superintendent's evaluation, but I think that it's a little bit unfair to ask her to have that ready by December 21st in just two weeks, given all that she's handling right now.

2194
03:36:41,592 --> 03:36:50,478
So I would respectfully ask that we put it to the first meeting that she would supply us that documentation at the first meeting of January.

2195
03:36:53,341 --> 03:36:55,849
or mid-January.

2196
03:36:55,930 --> 03:36:56,953
Okay, Democrats?

2197
03:37:00,565 --> 03:37:04,486
Yes, yep, so over the weekend, I reviewed the MASC guide.

2198
03:37:05,126 --> 03:37:09,527
It was sent to us, Mr. Russo, I don't know if you remember, but you sent it to us a while back, a few months back.

2199
03:37:10,067 --> 03:37:27,391
And so, yes, so the very first step is having the superintendent do her self-assessment, submit that to the committee, and then it takes place, I guess the evaluation will take place over several meetings that I think would be committee of the whole meetings.

2200
03:37:27,911 --> 03:37:30,292
And that would, you know, I think it's just,

2201
03:37:30,832 --> 03:37:41,935
you know, not achievable at this time to have everything done by December 31st with only a couple weeks left with all the upcoming scheduled meetings already.

2202
03:37:42,555 --> 03:37:56,099
So I, I agree with, you know, giving more time to, you know, to have the superintendent, you know, give us the assessment and then we'll have to meet once we get the assessment to,

2203
03:37:57,199 --> 03:38:02,701
clarify and ask questions, and then we'll have to do an assessment.

2204
03:38:02,762 --> 03:38:11,065
And I believe it also says that as a committee, we have to determine how we're going to go about doing the evaluation.

2205
03:38:11,085 --> 03:38:14,046
Are we going to do individual self-evaluations?

2206
03:38:14,126 --> 03:38:17,428
Are we going to do one big committee evaluation?

2207
03:38:17,828 --> 03:38:25,071
So there's still a lot of different factors that we have to talk about even before we do the evaluation.

2208
03:38:26,972 --> 03:38:29,433
But that's just what I wanted to mention.

2209
03:38:35,316 --> 03:38:36,197
Thank you, Member Kretz.

2210
03:38:36,677 --> 03:38:40,939
If I may ask a question, Dr. Edward-Woodmanson, what do you think is a good time frame?

2211
03:38:41,019 --> 03:38:44,701
So we have the December 31st date, we have beginning to mid-January.

2212
03:38:45,161 --> 03:38:48,803
How long do you need for self-evaluation so we can do it right?

2213
03:38:49,678 --> 03:38:51,799
and give you enough time, I know.

2214
03:38:52,540 --> 03:39:04,187
I would request if I could have the beginning to mid-January extension, just because there was just so much going on.

2215
03:39:04,227 --> 03:39:09,410
We're straight out with the testing and trying to get the high school up and running with students.

2216
03:39:09,470 --> 03:39:18,495
I just feel like if I can just have a little bit of additional time over the break, I'll be able to get all of that to the school committee.

2217
03:39:19,770 --> 03:39:25,792
Okay, so Member Van de Kloot, are you amending this to read self-evaluations by mid-January?

2218
03:39:26,533 --> 03:39:26,773
Yes.

2219
03:39:27,593 --> 03:39:38,838
I think it certainly, Kathy, since you had that review, if you could just send it to the rest of us so we could see the other steps involved, I think that would be important for us to review.

2220
03:39:40,155 --> 03:39:41,136
Yeah, no problem.

2221
03:39:41,436 --> 03:39:41,896
I can do that.

2222
03:39:42,497 --> 03:39:47,540
And who on the committee is responsible for taking this process through to completion?

2223
03:39:47,600 --> 03:39:52,143
Like who is going to ensure that all the steps are followed?

2224
03:39:52,363 --> 03:39:54,864
Like, does that fall to the chair?

2225
03:39:54,925 --> 03:39:56,886
Does it fall to a subcommittee?

2226
03:39:56,946 --> 03:40:00,688
Like what is the protocol that you all have used in past years?

2227
03:40:03,190 --> 03:40:07,292
In the past years, we've done it as a committee of the whole because

2228
03:40:08,400 --> 03:40:11,282
You know, every committee member wants to be involved in the process.

2229
03:40:12,042 --> 03:40:31,675
I think what we found out with the pre-budget meetings was we wanted to have those pre-budget meetings go to the personnel subcommittee meetings, but the entire committee wanted to be a part of that process because it's one of the major responsibilities that we have, which is the same thing with the superintendent evaluation.

2230
03:40:33,296 --> 03:40:38,617
outlined in the guidelines from MASC, you know, we have to decide how we're going to do it.

2231
03:40:38,938 --> 03:40:40,638
Are we going to do it as a committee of the whole?

2232
03:40:41,218 --> 03:40:43,479
Are we going to send it to the personnel subcommittee?

2233
03:40:44,239 --> 03:40:47,040
Would the other committee members be okay with that?

2234
03:40:47,440 --> 03:40:56,542
You know, if they sent in their, you know, their individual about like there's it's a it's a detailed guide, which I just reviewed over the weekend, which I'm going to send you.

2235
03:40:56,822 --> 03:40:58,003
So right after I

2236
03:40:58,883 --> 03:41:27,218
this um but so it is it's it's actually a big process you know so when i saw the resolution i said i when mr russo sent it earlier this year i looked at it over the summer and i started to go through it and it kept on saying the first step is that you must get the superintendent evaluation so i knew we couldn't do anything at that point until we have that so um yeah so i just revisited it again and um i will share that the document with you

2237
03:41:28,573 --> 03:41:30,834
Yeah, and I appreciate that it's a big process.

2238
03:41:30,874 --> 03:41:34,535
So I think that we have to commit to doing the big process.

2239
03:41:35,256 --> 03:41:43,899
And so my goal was to make sure that we are paying an appropriate amount of attention to our responsibilities as a committee.

2240
03:41:45,180 --> 03:41:52,743
And certainly if we need more time to complete the process, that is, I think, reasonable and fine.

2241
03:41:52,843 --> 03:41:57,425
I just wanna make sure that we prioritize it so we don't get to June and now we have

2242
03:41:57,985 --> 03:41:59,146
two reviews to write.

2243
03:42:00,926 --> 03:42:12,691
More importantly, sort of remembering back that far and trying to write a review this far in arrears is really unfair if you are committed to good review practices.

2244
03:42:12,771 --> 03:42:20,495
Like it's very unfair to wait months and months and months and then say this is what I think I thought back then because you just can't

2245
03:42:21,256 --> 03:42:24,019
You can't objectively sort of put all of that out of your mind.

2246
03:42:24,079 --> 03:42:31,087
So I want to make sure that we sort of get caught up and we're behind for lots of valid reasons.

2247
03:42:31,648 --> 03:42:39,017
But I also want to make sure that we have the discussion about goal setting because that goal setting discussion is what enables the process.

2248
03:42:39,998 --> 03:42:51,508
for next year, which I feel like we will just finish the superintendent's evaluation for last year when we are going to have to start the process all over again for this current year.

2249
03:42:51,648 --> 03:42:58,975
And we won't even have talked about goals, which is also it's really also unfair to be setting goals mid-year.

2250
03:43:01,153 --> 03:43:12,807
because being able to achieve goals when you haven't set them until the midpoint of the year makes it really unfair for the person we're asking to do all of this great work to actually be able to achieve goals.

2251
03:43:15,845 --> 03:43:21,448
Yes, but keep in mind that we have, in fact, been setting goals for the superintendent throughout this period.

2252
03:43:22,549 --> 03:43:32,536
We've talked about goals of inclusivity, of involving, if you think about all the meetings that we had during the summer, we've set a goal about getting kids back to school.

2253
03:43:32,956 --> 03:43:36,838
It's not like, I realize it hasn't been in the formal

2254
03:43:38,659 --> 03:43:48,744
way that you're suggesting, but it would be erroneous to think that we haven't been giving direction to our superintendent.

2255
03:43:49,724 --> 03:44:01,669
And we certainly have plenty to be able to reflect upon on how she has been handling this process, which is, in my opinion, been extremely strong.

2256
03:44:03,350 --> 03:44:20,940
My recollection from all other times is what we do is that each of us individually will fill out an evaluation once the superintendent gives us her self evaluation and then we'll gather as a committee and discuss it and

2257
03:44:21,784 --> 03:44:29,966
decide how we're gonna come up with either a collaborative document to then share with the superintendent.

2258
03:44:30,066 --> 03:44:34,387
And I think in the past, the superintendent has been part of those discussions.

2259
03:44:34,427 --> 03:44:48,031
But again, I think that the next step is to review what we're supposed to do technically, just to, so we all are on the same page, and that we ask the superintendent to provide us with her self-evaluation

2260
03:44:49,420 --> 03:44:53,803
by mid-January at the latest, so that we can go ahead with the process.

2261
03:44:54,423 --> 03:44:55,884
And I think we're all in agreement, really.

2262
03:44:58,946 --> 03:45:03,290
And I have it noted, so I'll call committee a whole right after we get that self-evaluation.

2263
03:45:05,331 --> 03:45:07,753
And what about the goals for this school year?

2264
03:45:10,931 --> 03:45:18,858
I figured we'd schedule a meeting after mid-January to review this self-evaluation, our evaluations plus goal setting.

2265
03:45:21,981 --> 03:45:23,763
Collectively, maybe the end of January.

2266
03:45:24,924 --> 03:45:34,153
Yes, I think we've already articulated many goals which we could write down and then we could take a look at and articulate goals for the rest of the year.

2267
03:45:37,550 --> 03:45:49,942
Okay, my recollection of the type of goal setting we're supposed to be doing in the superintendent's evaluation is far more prescriptive than the like day-to-day stuff we talk about all the time.

2268
03:45:50,102 --> 03:46:01,693
So they're supposed to be quantifiable and data-driven and I think they generally are intended to be slightly different than what you're referring to.

2269
03:46:02,148 --> 03:46:07,731
Well, and the superintendent also has a major piece in setting out goals.

2270
03:46:08,652 --> 03:46:18,597
So it's a joint conversation because she's very much will be a piece of articulating those goals and quantifying them as you suggest.

2271
03:46:20,739 --> 03:46:25,862
Maybe Madam Superintendent, you could, with your self-evaluation, you could

2272
03:46:27,157 --> 03:46:36,886
let us know what your goals, like self goals are so that we can kind of shape ours requests along the lines of what you're doing, what you're striving to do.

2273
03:46:36,906 --> 03:46:45,054
I know we all know some of what you're trying to do, but if you could maybe just put that in bullet points, that would be very helpful with the self-evaluation.

2274
03:46:45,735 --> 03:46:47,316
Yes, I would definitely be able to do that.

2275
03:46:47,336 --> 03:46:48,918
Democrats?

2276
03:46:50,133 --> 03:46:54,418
Yes, I just I just sent the link and I just wanted to there is a section.

2277
03:46:54,438 --> 03:47:06,411
It's on goals, and it says the evaluation model is goal focus is intended to foster growth on the part of the individual educator for the superintendent, and then it goes on to say that.

2278
03:47:07,192 --> 03:47:25,231
in regulations for the evaluation superintendents are required to have one professional practice goal related to their individual professional growth and one student learning goal related to their impact on student achievement so I don't think it's it's

2279
03:47:26,452 --> 03:47:32,658
Another typical I mean it's what's detailed here is just something different.

2280
03:47:33,379 --> 03:47:35,722
I know it was it was updated in December, 2019.

2281
03:47:37,884 --> 03:47:42,729
So I think that this is like the new guidelines for the

2282
03:47:43,249 --> 03:47:44,769
for the superintendent evaluation.

2283
03:47:44,809 --> 03:47:48,450
Yeah, we haven't done them yet.

2284
03:47:48,570 --> 03:47:53,351
We haven't done the new evaluation process with the new goals yet.

2285
03:47:53,511 --> 03:48:02,173
This will be the first time we're doing them, but it's just saying that there should be two goals, the student learning goal and the professional practice goal.

2286
03:48:08,855 --> 03:48:09,375
Member Russo.

2287
03:48:10,263 --> 03:48:10,543
Thank you.

2288
03:48:10,603 --> 03:48:17,966
Yes, thanks for remembering that email, Kathy, because you said I sent it, and I was like, did I?

2289
03:48:19,047 --> 03:48:26,189
And I went to the Summer Institute last summer, two summers ago, I guess, when we could actually go anywhere.

2290
03:48:27,770 --> 03:48:30,891
MASC had a session on the new evaluation

2291
03:48:34,770 --> 03:48:43,576
method even though it wasn't yet released and it was in fact such a dramatic change from the way they had been done before.

2292
03:48:44,117 --> 03:48:53,143
That was part of why I emailed like we got to get on this because how we've done in the past is sort of not actually terribly useful anymore because they've changed the whole system.

2293
03:48:53,924 --> 03:48:55,385
And to be clear

2294
03:48:56,285 --> 03:49:20,916
uh the old one there was like pages of these questions that we were supposed to answer as members and you know and and the feedback in the sessions that I the session I went to was many of the questions were things for which we didn't have any way to answer so the new system is dramatically better but it is in fact a whole new system so um it will take a little effort I'm just glad we won't have to fill out that

2295
03:49:22,086 --> 03:49:29,231
pages long set of questions for which we looked at them and we're like, how do we have an answer to these questions?

2296
03:49:29,291 --> 03:49:29,932
That was awful.

2297
03:49:32,133 --> 03:49:34,235
So do we need a second on this or?

2298
03:49:34,595 --> 03:49:39,979
Well, I think we just need to make sure that this is amended accordingly.

2299
03:49:40,079 --> 03:49:49,246
So, whereas the COVID school closures and associated budget impacts the spring to lay the school community's annual process, be resolved the school committee complete

2300
03:49:50,768 --> 03:50:07,977
that the superintendent complete her self-evaluation on or before January, let me just grab a date, 15th or 18th, 15th of Friday, so January 15th.

2301
03:50:10,258 --> 03:50:15,001
And at what date are we committing as a committee to do our part in the evaluation process?

2302
03:50:20,257 --> 03:50:26,739
That's up to the committee, but I would say we would try to have maybe have a committee whole on on our boat.

2303
03:50:28,419 --> 03:50:36,481
End of January, beginning of February, we have a meeting on January 25th and February 8th, or we could do a second of those week.

2304
03:50:37,021 --> 03:50:41,903
Let's set it for February 8th, that it will be done by February 8th.

2305
03:50:43,263 --> 03:50:43,363
Yep.

2306
03:50:49,869 --> 03:50:50,570
Motion on the floor.

2307
03:50:50,590 --> 03:50:52,511
I remember the last one.

2308
03:50:52,891 --> 03:50:53,531
Yeah, thank you.

2309
03:50:53,591 --> 03:50:54,732
I have a question.

2310
03:50:55,332 --> 03:51:03,136
So I'm not understanding when a member of Van de Kloet was saying it will be done on the 8th.

2311
03:51:03,636 --> 03:51:07,258
What will be done on the 8th?

2312
03:51:07,758 --> 03:51:09,819
By the 8th, the process should be complete.

2313
03:51:10,340 --> 03:51:14,622
So that means that if the superintendent gives us her self-evaluation at the first

2314
03:51:16,108 --> 03:51:30,990
or even the second meeting in January, and the first might be preferable, or mid-Feb, whatever, that we will have set up a committee of the whole meeting, and we will commit to having done the self-evaluations and the other steps.

2315
03:51:32,964 --> 03:51:48,933
Okay, so in between January 15th, when the superintendent shares her self-evaluation and February 8th, we need to schedule one or more committee of the whole meetings to review the material and discuss, right?

2316
03:51:49,473 --> 03:51:49,693
Yeah.

2317
03:51:50,574 --> 03:51:57,357
So that will be part of, that's part of the additional amendment to the motion, is that accurate?

2318
03:51:58,698 --> 03:51:58,978
Mayor?

2319
03:51:59,579 --> 03:52:02,140
Yes, that's accurate.

2320
03:52:04,396 --> 03:52:07,959
I'm saying that because I think Jenny does have a point that we want to get it done.

2321
03:52:08,079 --> 03:52:10,060
So that's why I'm putting an end date.

2322
03:52:10,501 --> 03:52:13,103
If we get it done before that, that's even better.

2323
03:52:13,183 --> 03:52:20,128
But this way, we've given the superintendent enough time, but we've committed ourselves to making sure it gets done.

2324
03:52:22,830 --> 03:52:25,953
Motion for approval by member.

2325
03:52:28,515 --> 03:52:28,835
Second.

2326
03:52:30,529 --> 03:52:34,331
Graham, it's her resolution, seconded by Member McLaughlin, if that's okay, roll call.

2327
03:52:34,812 --> 03:52:35,152
Graham?

2328
03:52:35,692 --> 03:52:35,933
Yes.

2329
03:52:36,393 --> 03:52:36,713
Kritz?

2330
03:52:37,393 --> 03:52:37,574
Yes.

2331
03:52:38,034 --> 03:52:38,654
McLaughlin?

2332
03:52:39,475 --> 03:52:39,775
Yes.

2333
03:52:40,195 --> 03:52:40,335
Ms.

2334
03:52:40,355 --> 03:52:40,676
Stone?

2335
03:52:40,936 --> 03:52:41,256
Yes.

2336
03:52:41,756 --> 03:52:42,197
Russo?

2337
03:52:42,737 --> 03:52:42,957
Yes.

2338
03:52:43,417 --> 03:52:43,898
Vander Kloot?

2339
03:52:43,918 --> 03:52:44,178
Yes.

2340
03:52:44,638 --> 03:52:44,898
Mayor?

2341
03:52:45,579 --> 03:52:48,881
Yes, 70 for a move, zero in the negative, paper passes as amended.

2342
03:52:50,448 --> 03:53:03,851
Offered by member Gramby, it resolved that the administration provide a report of adoption rates for usage of the alpha meds symptom checker and participation rates for voluntary testing that began the week of 1130.

2343
03:53:04,111 --> 03:53:12,653
We had further resolved that these rates be established by building with rates correlated to the number of students in the building during hybrid learning.

2344
03:53:13,333 --> 03:53:20,380
You'd also resolve that the administration will identify when reports can be provided to the committee for review and discussion number Graham.

2345
03:53:21,561 --> 03:53:30,970
So I think we sort of talk a lot about the denominator when it comes to students testing positive or staff testing positive and

2346
03:53:33,103 --> 03:53:55,089
we have an incredible sort of privilege of lots of tools available at our disposal to keep our community safe and I would like to have a better understanding of how adopted the tools are that we have so that we just are clear about if we're saying, you know, if we're saying

2347
03:53:55,727 --> 03:54:02,750
eight people tested positive, is it eight out of 10 or is it eight out of 4,000 or is it some other number?

2348
03:54:02,830 --> 03:54:16,476
So I would just like to have a better understanding of those participation rates as we head into the spring where I think there is, it sounds like still some question even about whether we can continue those things.

2349
03:54:16,516 --> 03:54:19,318
So it would be helpful to understand what those numbers are.

2350
03:54:22,619 --> 03:54:24,380
Seconded by member Russo, roll call.

2351
03:54:26,764 --> 03:54:27,364
Member Graham?

2352
03:54:28,085 --> 03:54:28,305
Yes.

2353
03:54:28,805 --> 03:54:29,325
McCracken?

2354
03:54:30,666 --> 03:54:30,846
Yes.

2355
03:54:31,727 --> 03:54:32,347
McLaughlin?

2356
03:54:33,588 --> 03:54:33,908
Yes.

2357
03:54:34,328 --> 03:54:34,808
McStone?

2358
03:54:35,909 --> 03:54:36,229
Yes.

2359
03:54:36,669 --> 03:54:37,149
Russo?

2360
03:54:37,810 --> 03:54:38,050
Yes.

2361
03:54:38,490 --> 03:54:39,270
Vander Kloot, yes.

2362
03:54:39,390 --> 03:54:40,451
Mayor Lungo-Kern?

2363
03:54:41,051 --> 03:54:41,331
Yes.

2364
03:54:41,552 --> 03:54:43,653
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, paper passes.

2365
03:54:44,513 --> 03:54:55,139
Also offered by Member Graham, be it resolved the administration provides the school committee a proposed schedule of budget hearings to create the 2021-2022 school budget no later than the first scheduled meeting in January 2021.

2366
03:55:00,149 --> 03:55:02,810
motion for approval by Member Van de Kloot.

2367
03:55:04,191 --> 03:55:08,914
Mayor, I would ask that we allow the superintendent a little bit more time than the first.

2368
03:55:09,154 --> 03:55:20,119
And to Member Graham, this is part of the superintendent's job to set up these meetings and do it in a timely fashion and whatever.

2369
03:55:20,760 --> 03:55:25,942
And I sometimes feel like it's important to let her have the latitude.

2370
03:55:26,503 --> 03:55:27,263
I understand your

2371
03:55:27,740 --> 03:55:31,862
your need to make sure that it's started early and that process is started early.

2372
03:55:32,722 --> 03:55:41,006
But again, I just personally, I think that we need to trust the superintendent.

2373
03:55:42,507 --> 03:55:52,651
And if she's not setting up the budget in a timely fashion or whatever, and I just don't think we have to legislate it as my own personal opinion.

2374
03:55:53,151 --> 03:55:53,932
I think that if you're,

2375
03:55:54,905 --> 03:55:57,827
Concerned about it or any member is concerned about it.

2376
03:55:58,647 --> 03:56:09,473
I think that for me that the best way about it is having conversation with the superintendent and only if she's not then being responsive would you then go about and put it in a resolution.

2377
03:56:09,593 --> 03:56:21,240
So my personal opinion is that this falls under the superintendent's purview and you're suggesting I think that you would like to have it sooner rather than later.

2378
03:56:22,194 --> 03:56:30,164
If you want to go forward with your resolution, which I'm sure you do, I would just suggest that we say that by the end of January, just to give her a little more latitude.

2379
03:56:31,726 --> 03:56:33,949
So I would amend it to be the end of January.

2380
03:56:38,223 --> 03:56:43,584
I think the point of laying out a schedule for the budget is not about trust.

2381
03:56:43,724 --> 03:56:48,886
And I'm so tired of us talking about who doesn't trust the superintendent.

2382
03:56:49,326 --> 03:56:51,086
It has nothing to do with trust.

2383
03:56:51,646 --> 03:56:58,328
It has to do with the fact that there are six people on this committee, countless administrators who need to be prepared for this process.

2384
03:56:58,968 --> 03:57:04,352
And a public that really wants to understand what the budget is going to look like for this upcoming year.

2385
03:57:04,412 --> 03:57:10,055
I mean, every day there's another article that talks about how dire the school budgets are going to be next year.

2386
03:57:10,075 --> 03:57:18,321
And I think it's our responsibility as the people who approve the budget to have a robust and thoughtful conversation

2387
03:57:19,301 --> 03:57:21,323
Um, and all I'm asking is for a schedule.

2388
03:57:21,503 --> 03:57:23,445
I didn't prescribe what the schedule is.

2389
03:57:23,465 --> 03:57:27,068
I just want to know so I can mark it in my calendar and plan my life.

2390
03:57:27,328 --> 03:57:34,635
I don't think that has anything to do with trust, and I think I have a second already on this motion, so we can go ahead and vote for it.

2391
03:57:36,296 --> 03:57:39,739
Will you accept the amendment to the end of January, Jenny?

2392
03:57:46,902 --> 03:57:49,904
Yes, I agree with Ms.

2393
03:57:49,924 --> 03:57:51,005
Vander Kloot.

2394
03:57:51,165 --> 03:58:06,497
I think, you know, I've been on the committee and over the past several years, the schedule does come out typically in February and the meetings begin sometimes I think as early as April.

2395
03:58:06,517 --> 03:58:08,679
And I know that

2396
03:58:11,016 --> 03:58:17,941
You know, we are putting a lot on the administration, the superintendent with everything going on with the COVID and the opening of the schools.

2397
03:58:19,142 --> 03:58:26,728
You know, I want to vote for a schedule, but I just think that we need some more time for the administration to get us the schedule.

2398
03:58:27,288 --> 03:58:32,570
and if we could just, you know, maybe a friendly amendment to, you know, as Ms.

2399
03:58:32,590 --> 03:58:39,893
Van De Koop mentioned, to the end of January, if, you know, they could get the schedule to us by then, and then we can have it all in our calendars.

2400
03:58:39,913 --> 03:58:50,158
We'll have the committee of the wholes, we'll have the superintendent's evaluation, we'll have the pre-budget meetings, and we'll have a complete calendar by the end of January.

2401
03:58:50,898 --> 03:58:52,259
I just think that, you know,

2402
03:58:53,239 --> 03:59:02,123
We have the holidays coming up in December and some of these administrators and teachers and staff, you know, they haven't had some time off.

2403
03:59:02,643 --> 03:59:13,088
So, you know, and we're still putting some things on them during the holidays, you know, by having them, you know, with the reopening of the schools, getting the students ready to get back into school.

2404
03:59:13,908 --> 03:59:20,570
the beginning of January for some of the high school students that still have to get back and just everything else that's going to go on.

2405
03:59:21,710 --> 03:59:34,654
As we enter, we just still have two more weeks left of actual school time and then it is holiday break and a lot of us just take some time off in the holidays.

2406
03:59:34,714 --> 03:59:40,715
I'd like to vote for it, but with an amendment for some more time.

2407
03:59:41,516 --> 03:59:42,576
That's all I wanted to say.

2408
03:59:44,493 --> 03:59:46,855
So I think I've offered an amendment.

2409
03:59:46,875 --> 03:59:48,557
I think Kathy has seconded it.

2410
03:59:48,677 --> 03:59:49,998
So should we vote on the amendment?

2411
03:59:52,841 --> 03:59:54,303
Will you accept the amendment, member Graham?

2412
03:59:55,684 --> 03:59:56,825
January 25th.

2413
03:59:56,885 --> 03:59:58,006
Is that what you're suggesting?

2414
03:59:58,226 --> 04:00:00,428
That's when our school committee meeting is, the second one?

2415
04:00:00,829 --> 04:00:01,069
Yep.

2416
04:00:01,209 --> 04:00:02,450
January 25th it is.

2417
04:00:03,391 --> 04:00:03,672
Great.

2418
04:00:04,112 --> 04:00:05,233
On that motion.

2419
04:00:05,293 --> 04:00:08,816
Motion for approval by member Graham, seconded by member Van de Kloot.

2420
04:00:08,836 --> 04:00:09,237
Roll call.

2421
04:00:09,788 --> 04:00:10,388
Member Graham?

2422
04:00:10,769 --> 04:00:11,029
Yes.

2423
04:00:11,749 --> 04:00:12,370
Member Kretz?

2424
04:00:12,970 --> 04:00:13,171
Yes.

2425
04:00:13,731 --> 04:00:14,612
Member McLaughlin?

2426
04:00:15,072 --> 04:00:15,392
Yes.

2427
04:00:15,712 --> 04:00:16,473
Member Massone?

2428
04:00:17,233 --> 04:00:17,554
Yes.

2429
04:00:17,934 --> 04:00:18,635
Member Rousseau?

2430
04:00:19,355 --> 04:00:19,595
Yes.

2431
04:00:19,996 --> 04:00:20,756
Member Vander Kloot?

2432
04:00:20,776 --> 04:00:21,036
Yes.

2433
04:00:21,116 --> 04:00:22,017
Mayor Longo Kern?

2434
04:00:22,317 --> 04:00:22,537
Yes.

2435
04:00:22,577 --> 04:00:24,119
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

2436
04:00:24,219 --> 04:00:25,299
The paper passes.

2437
04:00:25,319 --> 04:00:30,383
Ad hoc report request.

2438
04:00:30,623 --> 04:00:32,144
Report on COVID grant spending.

2439
04:00:32,264 --> 04:00:32,605
How much?

2440
04:00:34,013 --> 04:00:38,114
money has been spent related to COVID that has covered, was covered by grants?

2441
04:00:38,214 --> 04:00:39,214
What were those grants?

2442
04:00:39,294 --> 04:00:46,937
How much money is left within each grant seeking itemization and categorization of spending by grant offered by member Rousseau?

2443
04:00:49,517 --> 04:00:50,617
Hi, Mayor, thank you.

2444
04:00:51,378 --> 04:01:01,800
I did have a brief conversation with the superintendent about this, and I know that it is not as simple a task as it might sound.

2445
04:01:01,981 --> 04:01:03,541
And, you know, the funding is,

2446
04:01:04,224 --> 04:01:06,685
all over the place and some of it's in the city side.

2447
04:01:07,726 --> 04:01:11,527
But I think that, so I had a date in there initially.

2448
04:01:11,608 --> 04:01:13,608
I don't, the date isn't critical.

2449
04:01:13,688 --> 04:01:18,071
It certainly is critical to know this before we start that budget process.

2450
04:01:19,351 --> 04:01:23,253
So if there's no questions, I would hope we could just approve this.

2451
04:01:27,015 --> 04:01:27,315
Second.

2452
04:01:29,053 --> 04:01:30,835
member McLaughlin and member Kratz.

2453
04:01:31,916 --> 04:01:32,936
Yeah, I had a question.

2454
04:01:33,477 --> 04:01:36,239
Thank you, Mayor.

2455
04:01:37,821 --> 04:01:54,415
So it sounds like now we're saying in addition to the self-evaluation that the superintendents need to do on the 15th and the scheduling for all of the budget meetings that the superintendent needs to do on the 25th,

2456
04:01:55,673 --> 04:02:09,839
we're now asking her to give us all of the COVID-related spending data between January 15th and 25th while returning our high school students to school during the global pandemic.

2457
04:02:11,319 --> 04:02:12,040
Is that accurate?

2458
04:02:14,741 --> 04:02:20,063
Yes, it's accurate, although I don't think the superintendent is the finance person, so I would hope she's not doing it herself.

2459
04:02:25,680 --> 04:02:28,083
Member Kratz and then the member van de Kloot.

2460
04:02:31,027 --> 04:02:35,313
Yes, I was going to say the same thing as McLaughlin said is that.

2461
04:02:36,756 --> 04:02:40,219
I don't think it's achievable right now.

2462
04:02:40,239 --> 04:02:58,613
I do think it will be achievable and I thought I recall that this would be an ad hoc request like report where it's supposed to be sent to the superintendent not in the form of a resolution but as an ad hoc request report so that.

2463
04:02:59,093 --> 04:03:05,602
She could then look at it and determine if it's feasible to be done and possibly how long it would take.

2464
04:03:05,642 --> 04:03:07,644
That's how I read the resolution.

2465
04:03:07,664 --> 04:03:15,774
I do think that at some point we're going to need that information as we go into the budget, but I don't think

2466
04:03:16,395 --> 04:03:26,441
you know, immediately we need that information, you know, in January, you know, we're going to, you know, have the date set for the pre-budget.

2467
04:03:26,761 --> 04:03:36,967
We're going to need some information about what's, you know, left over for the grants, but, you know, having that information right away in the middle of the global pandemic,

2468
04:03:38,235 --> 04:03:45,061
directly after the holidays with the superintendent evaluation in the pre-budget schedule.

2469
04:03:45,101 --> 04:03:50,686
I mean, I just think that I'm getting overwhelmed just thinking about it and I'm not the superintendent.

2470
04:03:51,306 --> 04:03:52,287
That's all I wanted to say.

2471
04:03:53,188 --> 04:03:55,890
It's just we're putting a lot on one person.

2472
04:03:55,910 --> 04:04:00,835
I did use the ad hoc report policy and form.

2473
04:04:01,996 --> 04:04:04,297
It was just, it was compiled into this,

2474
04:04:05,715 --> 04:04:06,936
format on the agenda.

2475
04:04:07,116 --> 04:04:12,859
So I did follow the full policy, Kathy, that you and I worked on, so.

2476
04:04:13,560 --> 04:04:15,701
Thanks, thank you.

2477
04:04:15,781 --> 04:04:17,562
So, Mayor.

2478
04:04:17,862 --> 04:04:18,783
Yes, Member Van Der Kloof.

2479
04:04:18,803 --> 04:04:19,983
Just a follow up on that.

2480
04:04:20,063 --> 04:04:27,367
So that means, will the superintendent then report back to us at our next school committee meeting about when that report can be done?

2481
04:04:28,828 --> 04:04:32,470
So what I will do is I'll work with the finance team and

2482
04:04:34,921 --> 04:04:52,912
If we are able to get all of those pieces, the specific questions that are listed, I will try to have it available for us at the very next meeting, if possible, but knowing that there could be a little, you know,

2483
04:04:53,943 --> 04:05:15,093
you know, some things could shift or change, but in terms of what the COVID grants are, because I did speak to member Russo, the different grants that we've used, what was the money being spent on, not everything has been spent, what's been pre-encumbered.

2484
04:05:16,594 --> 04:05:21,376
So I will try to definitely as closely as possible,

2485
04:05:23,710 --> 04:05:31,353
get the information for this ad hoc report request, and I'll just, you know, make it a priority.

2486
04:05:34,374 --> 04:05:34,614
Mayor?

2487
04:05:34,654 --> 04:05:34,795
Yeah.

2488
04:05:35,535 --> 04:05:36,135
Member Russo?

2489
04:05:36,635 --> 04:05:36,935
Thank you.

2490
04:05:36,975 --> 04:05:47,640
I just, you know, I feel like, you know, when I submitted the ad hoc report request, we have, when we worked out the policy for this, or the rule, its procedure, you know, the background was really important.

2491
04:05:47,920 --> 04:05:52,602
And, you know, for me, the background here, I think you all should know, is, you know,

2492
04:05:54,653 --> 04:06:01,879
as dark as it sounds, we cannot be confident that we will not be dealing with COVID come next September.

2493
04:06:02,759 --> 04:06:05,862
Nobody's even begun vaccination trials for children.

2494
04:06:06,562 --> 04:06:08,624
They take much, much longer.

2495
04:06:09,144 --> 04:06:22,095
So if we need to plan for next September, looking at anything like it did this September, we need to plan when we do the budget, not in August when we discover that, oh, it looks like, you know,

2496
04:06:22,827 --> 04:06:25,491
so and so is not going to have a new vaccine to us.

2497
04:06:26,071 --> 04:06:37,948
So, you know, some of these things like this feel like they're very early, but I don't know about anybody else, but I really don't want to have the budget mess we had last year where it was like the 11th hour where we had to

2498
04:06:38,754 --> 04:06:43,797
pass it or else to send it to city council who had the 11th hour to pass it or else.

2499
04:06:45,077 --> 04:06:46,578
Cause that wasn't any good.

2500
04:06:46,598 --> 04:06:49,640
It wasn't good for any of us, the city or anybody.

2501
04:06:51,201 --> 04:07:00,766
And I feel like come the spring when we go doing our budget, the number of unknowns, they're not gonna be terribly different than they were last budget cycle.

2502
04:07:01,366 --> 04:07:04,748
So I say, let's just suffer early.

2503
04:07:05,990 --> 04:07:12,394
so we can make corrections rather than suffering at the very last second, which is what we did last time, so.

2504
04:07:15,376 --> 04:07:19,679
I don't believe that we will have the same suffering that we endured last year.

2505
04:07:19,699 --> 04:07:31,026
I am optimistic that we will be able to get the budget meeting scheduled and be able to have rich conversations

2506
04:07:32,147 --> 04:07:33,588
in advance of the deadline.

2507
04:07:34,609 --> 04:07:44,554
The process may look a little differently, but I think we're going to be able to get there and be able to have the meaningful conversations that do need to happen.

2508
04:07:45,554 --> 04:07:52,838
And I do agree with what you shared, Member Rousseau, that we don't know yet what's going to happen with the vaccine.

2509
04:07:53,335 --> 04:07:55,398
They're talking about the end of the second quarter.

2510
04:07:56,039 --> 04:08:02,248
So, there is a lot of information that we have to keep in mind and just think about how schools function and run.

2511
04:08:03,370 --> 04:08:04,632
As we think about school year 2122.

2512
04:08:04,672 --> 04:08:04,712
So,

2513
04:08:08,951 --> 04:08:22,475
you know, we will do our due diligence in central office to get you as many responses as possible to those specific questions related to COVID expenses.

2514
04:08:22,815 --> 04:08:37,320
And what we're not able to get, we will work on it, but we will be able to get you something, something substantive, not just something substantive to respond to those specific questions that you have.

2515
04:08:43,238 --> 04:08:43,758
Thank you both.

2516
04:08:45,639 --> 04:08:49,620
I don't know if we want to move the paper or if that's good enough.

2517
04:08:52,201 --> 04:08:54,241
Should we vote on it as a motion?

2518
04:08:54,901 --> 04:08:58,903
Yeah, because there's no date, but I know Dr. Edward Vincent will work on it.

2519
04:08:58,983 --> 04:09:05,524
So motion by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member Van de Kloot.

2520
04:09:05,604 --> 04:09:05,945
Roll call.

2521
04:09:09,701 --> 04:09:09,981
Yes.

2522
04:09:10,462 --> 04:09:10,742
Yes.

2523
04:09:11,643 --> 04:09:11,843
Yes.

2524
04:09:12,363 --> 04:09:12,483
Yes.

2525
04:09:12,503 --> 04:09:12,623
Yes.

2526
04:09:12,663 --> 04:09:12,984
Yes.

2527
04:09:13,764 --> 04:09:14,104
