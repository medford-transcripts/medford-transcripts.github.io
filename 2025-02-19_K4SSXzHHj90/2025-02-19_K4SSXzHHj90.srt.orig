[SPEAKER_25]: Thanks.

2
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:48,881
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

3
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,963
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm well.

4
00:08:54,728 --> 00:08:57,071
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much.

5
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:54,063
[SPEAKER_16]: Two, test one two.

6
00:24:52,661 --> 00:24:54,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you ready?

7
00:25:30,009 --> 00:25:33,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Governance Committee, February 19, 2025.

8
00:25:33,914 --> 00:25:43,184
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, can you call the roll, please?

9
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, we're dealing with some sound issues here.

10
00:25:58,548 --> 00:25:59,289
[SPEAKER_08]: No, mine's quiet.

11
00:25:59,669 --> 00:26:00,149
[SPEAKER_08]: Mine's quiet.

12
00:26:03,051 --> 00:26:03,491
[SPEAKER_09]: Click this one?

13
00:26:03,912 --> 00:26:04,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, just do test.

14
00:26:05,493 --> 00:26:05,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Try again.

15
00:26:07,474 --> 00:26:07,594
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

16
00:26:07,614 --> 00:26:07,594
1, 2, 3.

17
00:26:07,874 --> 00:26:08,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Test.

18
00:26:08,095 --> 00:26:08,075
1, 2, 3.

19
00:26:20,023 --> 00:26:20,263
[SPEAKER_21]: Test.

20
00:26:20,363 --> 00:26:20,263
1, 2, 3.

21
00:26:29,985 --> 00:26:30,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Test 1, 2, 3.

22
00:26:34,149 --> 00:26:36,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for hanging in there with us.

23
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:43,017
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Collins.

24
00:26:45,058 --> 00:26:45,399
[SPEAKER_18]: Present.

25
00:26:54,647 --> 00:26:54,967
[SPEAKER_30]: Present.

26
00:27:19,764 --> 00:27:19,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

27
00:27:20,944 --> 00:27:21,785
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Zara.

28
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,167
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Scapelli.

29
00:27:29,988 --> 00:27:31,269
[SPEAKER_21]: Chairman Singh.

30
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:33,069
[SPEAKER_21]: President and if we can try it.

31
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:33,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

32
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:38,151
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Collins.

33
00:27:39,952 --> 00:27:40,392
[SPEAKER_30]: Present.

34
00:27:42,833 --> 00:27:43,593
[SPEAKER_09]: She said present, but

35
00:28:29,993 --> 00:28:32,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, can you unmute and say something for us?

36
00:28:34,075 --> 00:28:34,456
[SPEAKER_18]: Present.

37
00:28:36,257 --> 00:28:37,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I can only hear.

38
00:29:32,916 --> 00:29:32,999
Bye.

39
00:30:08,261 --> 00:30:09,483
[SPEAKER_17]: Testing, testing.

40
00:30:18,196 --> 00:30:18,697
[SPEAKER_17]: Testing.

41
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,141
[SPEAKER_17]: Testing.

42
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,737
[SPEAKER_09]: They're saying the people online are saying that we're quiet.

43
00:30:47,458 --> 00:30:48,279
[SPEAKER_09]: The chambers are quiet.

44
00:30:48,339 --> 00:30:50,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

45
00:30:51,821 --> 00:30:52,782
[SPEAKER_09]: So they can't really hear us.

46
00:31:18,855 --> 00:31:21,057
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I turned all of them on when they're working.

47
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:29,746
[SPEAKER_16]: It does come out the laptop.

48
00:31:29,806 --> 00:31:34,691
[SPEAKER_16]: When I do it to the one you just said, it says fail to detect speaker.

49
00:31:34,711 --> 00:31:36,493
[SPEAKER_16]: Make sure your speaker is properly connected.

50
00:31:36,553 --> 00:31:39,696
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure if something got unplugged.

51
00:34:55,065 --> 00:34:55,285
[SPEAKER_24]: Test.

52
00:34:55,305 --> 00:34:55,426
[SPEAKER_24]: Test.

53
00:36:19,217 --> 00:36:24,920
[SPEAKER_09]: meeting looking into the Charter Study Committee's recommendations as sent to us from the Mayor's Office.

54
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:33,804
[SPEAKER_09]: This is also slated to be the last substantive meeting here in the Governance Committee before we send it to the Committee as a whole.

55
00:36:34,665 --> 00:36:35,825
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pending a motion.

56
00:36:37,066 --> 00:36:47,051
[SPEAKER_09]: We are going to be discussing in particular Articles 4 on the School Committee, Article 8 on Citizen Participation Mechanisms, Article 9

57
00:36:48,013 --> 00:37:06,342
[SPEAKER_09]: general provisions and all other sections, article 10 transitional provisions, and as well as section 2-4, 3-1D, and 4-4 on compensation of elected officials that got moved to this meeting per a motion earlier in the governance committee a few meetings ago.

58
00:37:07,522 --> 00:37:11,204
[SPEAKER_09]: We also have call-in center representatives here in attendance at this meeting as well.

59
00:37:12,545 --> 00:37:13,105
[SPEAKER_09]: To kick it off,

60
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:17,052
[SPEAKER_09]: We can go straight into article four on the school committee.

61
00:37:17,492 --> 00:37:21,174
[SPEAKER_09]: I know a few school committee members have sent in comments to me.

62
00:37:22,094 --> 00:37:26,196
[SPEAKER_09]: I will read out relevant comments to each section as we go.

63
00:37:26,717 --> 00:37:36,602
[SPEAKER_09]: But before we get there, are there any comments from city councilors either generally or on section four dash one on composition, term of office or eligibility?

64
00:37:41,944 --> 00:37:42,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Recognizing president

65
00:37:43,593 --> 00:37:43,953
[SPEAKER_09]: bears.

66
00:37:44,734 --> 00:37:45,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

67
00:37:45,494 --> 00:38:03,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Counselor saying, um, I think the main takeaway from the comments we received in my review, um, and just a review of the charter study committee report, um, and what many other communities in Massachusetts do.

68
00:38:03,045 --> 00:38:08,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, my main question on four one is, let me just make sure it's in here.

69
00:38:08,728 --> 00:38:08,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Um,

70
00:38:12,255 --> 00:38:40,043
[SPEAKER_06]: both the question of the mayor serving on the school committee in general, and specifically that the mayor automatically is the chair, given the views that I've had of the other charters, my reading of the Charter Study Committee, some of the survey results, some of the comments, and the comments from our sitting school committee members, it seems to me that the way this is currently written

71
00:38:41,804 --> 00:38:45,947
[SPEAKER_06]: doesn't really reflect the direction that the community talked about going.

72
00:38:47,148 --> 00:39:00,017
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would like to at least have a discussion about the mayor serving as the chair versus the school committee being able to elect its own chair and potentially also the service of the mayor in general.

73
00:39:00,217 --> 00:39:08,943
[SPEAKER_06]: But after we discuss this section and pending results of the discussion, I'm likely to make a motion to suggest that the

74
00:39:10,076 --> 00:39:12,977
[SPEAKER_06]: may or serve as a member, but that the body be able to elect its own chair.

75
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:18,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Recognizing Councilor Zara.

76
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:19,720
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

77
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,241
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I would agree with President Behrs.

78
00:39:24,101 --> 00:39:37,847
[SPEAKER_26]: We received comments from school committee member Paul Russo and school committee member or vice chair Jenny Graham both mentioned that the mayor serving as the chair while it's

79
00:39:39,372 --> 00:40:01,366
[SPEAKER_26]: It's great that the mayor has so much of an active role on the school committee and how much awareness that brings for that position into the school committee's decisions and actions.

80
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:06,409
[SPEAKER_26]: Our mayor is already in an extremely strong position.

81
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:13,561
[SPEAKER_26]: you know, compared with other cities, the mayor's role is already a huge job.

82
00:40:13,721 --> 00:40:16,163
[SPEAKER_26]: The school committee is also a huge job.

83
00:40:16,343 --> 00:40:23,506
[SPEAKER_26]: It's two huge roles, seems unnecessarily overwhelming.

84
00:40:25,207 --> 00:40:32,271
[SPEAKER_26]: And the survey results stated that people thought that it wasn't appropriate.

85
00:40:32,511 --> 00:40:34,171
[SPEAKER_26]: So I would agree with that.

86
00:40:34,332 --> 00:40:34,672
[SPEAKER_26]: I think it,

87
00:40:35,747 --> 00:40:39,109
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not sure about the mayor serving on the school committee.

88
00:40:40,289 --> 00:40:41,130
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not sure if it's better.

89
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:50,954
[SPEAKER_26]: But I think automatically serving as chair seems like not what the community asked for.

90
00:40:52,835 --> 00:40:53,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

91
00:40:53,615 --> 00:40:56,037
[SPEAKER_09]: Councillor Zaro, I see Councillor Scarpelli.

92
00:40:56,837 --> 00:40:57,197
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

93
00:40:57,637 --> 00:41:02,760
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, I appreciate the hard work of the chatter review committee and

94
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:11,157
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, I disagree with my colleagues as a former school committee member for many years.

95
00:41:12,078 --> 00:41:14,781
[SPEAKER_20]: The importance to have the leader of your community, if

96
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:29,515
[SPEAKER_20]: this committee saw fit that she would still represent a voting member of the school committee is that it's very important and vital piece that that person is the chairperson leading that meeting.

97
00:41:31,075 --> 00:41:44,100
[SPEAKER_20]: It just doesn't make sense that the leader of your community is a side chair to a committee that really doesn't move forward without the power of the mayor.

98
00:41:45,222 --> 00:42:01,711
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, I've read my colleagues on the school committee's requests and what their, what the concerns were for the members that I've talked to in the charter committee that this is something that people supported.

99
00:42:02,291 --> 00:42:04,933
[SPEAKER_20]: And if we were going that way, this is what we needed.

100
00:42:06,254 --> 00:42:11,797
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'll say this probably 10 more times until after the vote, whenever that may be, but

101
00:42:12,849 --> 00:42:24,776
[SPEAKER_20]: the more that this council dips in and changes to fit a narrative, the less likely that this will move forward.

102
00:42:26,256 --> 00:42:29,678
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that has to be a realistic concern.

103
00:42:30,659 --> 00:42:41,665
[SPEAKER_20]: I've already talked to state delegates that have said that residents have already approached them with the disdain that they've heard already from just the ward representation question.

104
00:42:42,757 --> 00:42:51,481
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's, this is hard work from people that, many people on this council put instead of this process.

105
00:42:52,141 --> 00:43:06,828
[SPEAKER_20]: And a long time with professionals sitting at the table, and it seems like as you read these answers, these questions and these changes, they seem one-sided and set to be, to fit a certain dialogue.

106
00:43:08,373 --> 00:43:14,237
[SPEAKER_20]: I know I've been, in the past, mentioned that everything I turn into is political.

107
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:20,880
[SPEAKER_20]: You can say it, or you can read it.

108
00:43:22,501 --> 00:43:32,527
[SPEAKER_20]: Because this is exactly what councils in the past have asked for, and many people have tried to change the charter, and we move forward with a group of people that work very hard

109
00:43:33,245 --> 00:43:38,649
[SPEAKER_20]: to bring out this initiative that was supported by the call-in center or vetted out by the call-in center.

110
00:43:41,091 --> 00:43:49,316
[SPEAKER_20]: And already, this should have been something that I read through when I had colleagues in neighboring communities read through and see the process.

111
00:43:49,376 --> 00:44:00,224
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, like I said, I made sure I invested my time to make sure that I looked at what my faults were with what I didn't like about the charter, which is ward representation.

112
00:44:00,784 --> 00:44:01,485
[SPEAKER_20]: And I realized

113
00:44:02,696 --> 00:44:13,618
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm wrong for the fact that having that representation opens up having everybody in this community have a voice.

114
00:44:17,259 --> 00:44:31,382
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, just bits and pieces that as my experience in the city school can remember, I think if we're going to move forward with the mayor being a voted member, it's imperative that whoever that man may be that they're in that leadership role.

115
00:44:34,167 --> 00:44:53,787
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, for whatever it's worth, one out of seven people on a voting council that have seen just the rubber stamp that's moved forward, I hope the community understands as we move forward with the changes that my fellow colleagues keep bringing up,

116
00:44:54,653 --> 00:45:01,275
[SPEAKER_20]: is just damaging what this group has done so hard to bring to fruition.

117
00:45:01,455 --> 00:45:04,335
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, thank you for your hard work.

118
00:45:04,395 --> 00:45:15,098
[SPEAKER_20]: I know that many of you out there spent a lot of time to get the proper information out and vetted with the proper channels, but thank you.

119
00:45:17,196 --> 00:45:18,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

120
00:45:18,838 --> 00:45:23,703
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to note that we also have school committee member Nicole Branley here in the audience with us today.

121
00:45:25,585 --> 00:45:32,272
[SPEAKER_09]: I have been, and as I noted before, oh, okay.

122
00:45:32,292 --> 00:45:37,217
[SPEAKER_09]: I have been in talks and former school committee member Sharon Hayes too.

123
00:45:37,617 --> 00:45:37,918
[SPEAKER_09]: I have

124
00:45:38,883 --> 00:45:41,225
[SPEAKER_09]: been talking to members of our state delegation as well.

125
00:45:41,626 --> 00:45:48,973
[SPEAKER_09]: The general gist is that it is in the council's purview to make edits to the city charter, even if those edits are substantive.

126
00:45:50,254 --> 00:46:00,505
[SPEAKER_09]: When it comes to likelihood of passage or not, it's more about whether the model being proposed by the city council is something that the state legislature has seen and passed before.

127
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:15,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Before I move on to comments, written comments from school committee members, are there any other counselors who'd like to talk on this issue more specifically about the mayor being chair of the school committee?

128
00:46:19,315 --> 00:46:32,437
[SPEAKER_09]: seeing none on Zoom or in person, vice, I'm gonna read what vice chair Jenny Graham has written to me or in this committee about school committee structure.

129
00:46:33,858 --> 00:46:42,379
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the most concerning aspects of the proposed charter is the provision in article four that allows the mayor to serve as the chair and a voting member of the school committee.

130
00:46:42,899 --> 00:46:48,340
[SPEAKER_09]: The school committee's primary responsibility is to focus solely on the education needs of Medford's children.

131
00:46:48,988 --> 00:46:53,752
[SPEAKER_09]: allowing the mayor to continue to hold a voting role, but undermine this critical separation.

132
00:46:54,433 --> 00:47:02,660
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree, of course, that there needs to be a solid working relationship between the school committee and the chair and value my own relationship with the current mayor immensely.

133
00:47:03,306 --> 00:47:11,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Too often, though, there are clear signs of a conflict of interest between the role of the mayor of the city and the role of the mayor as the chair.

134
00:47:12,048 --> 00:47:20,270
[SPEAKER_09]: For practical purposes, I have observed this when it comes time to discussions of compensation and contracting, and most specifically at budget time.

135
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:27,372
[SPEAKER_09]: For many years in Medford, the school committee never asked for a penny more than the city had to give.

136
00:47:28,372 --> 00:47:30,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Further, when I asked about the process and

137
00:47:32,506 --> 00:47:41,512
[SPEAKER_09]: how the school committee received the number from the city because surely that's how such complete alignment occurs in my mind.

138
00:47:42,052 --> 00:47:46,335
[SPEAKER_09]: I was met with seasoned members insisting that this wasn't how it worked at all.

139
00:47:46,856 --> 00:47:56,602
[SPEAKER_09]: In my five years, I've never once seen this alignment because the school committee has prioritized putting forward budget requests that reflect our need as the starting point.

140
00:47:57,223 --> 00:48:00,545
[SPEAKER_09]: This step was skipped entirely for many years to the detriment of our schools.

141
00:48:01,355 --> 00:48:08,802
[SPEAKER_09]: If I were a mayor, I can completely understand why such alignment would be desirable, but doing so undermines authority and responsibility of the committee.

142
00:48:09,382 --> 00:48:13,326
[SPEAKER_09]: This is perhaps the most important rationale for removing the mayor from the school committee.

143
00:48:13,826 --> 00:48:21,353
[SPEAKER_09]: The Charter Study Committee's own survey stated that only 20% of respondents believed that the mayor should be the chair of a school committee.

144
00:48:22,421 --> 00:48:31,145
[SPEAKER_09]: In addition, two-year terms are simply too short to cultivate the depth of experience and long-term vision necessary for effective governance in education.

145
00:48:31,625 --> 00:48:37,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Short terms without the stability of longer terms make it difficult to implement meaningful change and may introduce constant disruptions.

146
00:48:38,628 --> 00:48:48,612
[SPEAKER_09]: This next section is more about ward and district organizations, so I'm gonna move on to school committee member Rousseau's comment.

147
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:54,922
[SPEAKER_09]: on the mayor being the chair of the school committee, the mayor should not serve as the chair of the school committee.

148
00:48:55,243 --> 00:49:02,286
[SPEAKER_09]: The rationale for maintaining this arrangement seems to downplay the significance of the school committee, treating it as just another committee to oversee.

149
00:49:02,886 --> 00:49:07,088
[SPEAKER_09]: In reality, being the chair of the school committee is a substantial responsibility.

150
00:49:07,628 --> 00:49:18,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Additionally, there is a widespread misunderstanding regarding the mayor's authority, with many from the public to other elected officials in school and municipal employees believing it exceeds that of other school committee members.

151
00:49:18,633 --> 00:49:20,594
[SPEAKER_09]: This misconception creates significant issues.

152
00:49:20,794 --> 00:49:28,597
[SPEAKER_09]: It's now crucial more than ever for elected officials to operate strictly within the legal authority granted to them rather than any authority they choose to assert.

153
00:49:29,297 --> 00:49:32,122
[SPEAKER_09]: the structure of the school committee and city council should be consistent.

154
00:49:32,523 --> 00:49:35,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Whether it is entirely at large, entirely ward based.

155
00:49:35,909 --> 00:49:41,579
[SPEAKER_09]: This is also about the ward district organization.

156
00:49:42,497 --> 00:49:45,278
[SPEAKER_09]: from a school committee member in Tapa.

157
00:49:45,878 --> 00:49:50,000
[SPEAKER_09]: I have the following comment in regards to the mayor's seat on the committee.

158
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:50,840
[SPEAKER_09]: I am impartial.

159
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:55,101
[SPEAKER_09]: I do see the benefit of both aspects as presented by some of my colleagues on social media.

160
00:49:55,742 --> 00:50:00,963
[SPEAKER_09]: I could very well see the benefit of having a seventh seat for someone to run for in the school committee race.

161
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:05,745
[SPEAKER_09]: With that being said, I did come in seventh last election, so maybe I have a bias towards that proposition.

162
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:13,634
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any other comments from current school committee members?

163
00:50:16,397 --> 00:50:16,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

164
00:50:19,179 --> 00:50:24,204
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have comments on the mayor being chair of the school committee, name and address for the record.

165
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Give me one sec.

166
00:50:28,708 --> 00:50:29,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me turn you on.

167
00:50:41,753 --> 00:50:48,551
[SPEAKER_23]: Hello, Nicole Bramley, 54 North Circle in Medford, member of the Medford School Committee currently.

168
00:50:51,196 --> 00:50:54,877
[SPEAKER_23]: I did not submit any comments on any of the topic.

169
00:50:54,997 --> 00:50:57,538
[SPEAKER_23]: I did read over Member Graham's.

170
00:50:57,718 --> 00:50:59,559
[SPEAKER_23]: I read over Member Ntoppe's.

171
00:51:00,439 --> 00:51:02,360
[SPEAKER_23]: I did read some of Member Rousseau's.

172
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:05,921
[SPEAKER_23]: It was 12 pages long, so bear with me.

173
00:51:06,462 --> 00:51:11,564
[SPEAKER_23]: But yeah, so for Mayor being our chair, I see it as

174
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:13,024
[SPEAKER_23]: two ways here.

175
00:51:13,785 --> 00:51:17,888
[SPEAKER_23]: One, no matter who the mayor is, I'm going to just say she because she's currently our mayor.

176
00:51:19,188 --> 00:51:25,272
[SPEAKER_23]: I do like it for the sense that she is involved with knowing what's going on at the school at all times.

177
00:51:28,214 --> 00:51:33,438
[SPEAKER_23]: Obviously that is my hugest priority to make sure our schools are safe and well-maintained and taken care of.

178
00:51:33,518 --> 00:51:37,221
[SPEAKER_23]: So I do like that aspect of it.

179
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:43,606
[SPEAKER_23]: But then there's the other aspect of it that I feel like it should be a seven-member body just like the council.

180
00:51:44,807 --> 00:51:48,610
[SPEAKER_23]: So I really don't have a preference.

181
00:51:50,031 --> 00:51:50,911
[SPEAKER_23]: I want to thank the

182
00:51:52,052 --> 00:51:57,135
[SPEAKER_23]: I know some of those members are here tonight and on Zoom for all the work that they did on the chatter review.

183
00:51:57,516 --> 00:51:59,437
[SPEAKER_23]: It was a huge undertaking.

184
00:52:00,818 --> 00:52:01,759
[SPEAKER_23]: So thank you for that.

185
00:52:02,379 --> 00:52:11,845
[SPEAKER_23]: I really don't have much to comment about for once, for once, but I wanted to be here just to hear what was going on.

186
00:52:11,945 --> 00:52:12,726
[SPEAKER_23]: So thank you.

187
00:52:13,426 --> 00:52:15,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, member Bramley.

188
00:52:16,328 --> 00:52:18,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have any other comments from

189
00:52:20,398 --> 00:52:31,625
[SPEAKER_09]: current school committee members who might be on Zoom or counselors before I open, or well, we don't have a motion before yet, but before I open this up for public participation.

190
00:52:34,427 --> 00:52:42,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, do any members of the public want to come and speak about this issue?

191
00:52:42,973 --> 00:52:44,373
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you're on Zoom, please raise your hand.

192
00:52:45,674 --> 00:52:46,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address for the record, please.

193
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:54,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, there we go.

194
00:52:54,996 --> 00:52:55,657
[SPEAKER_09]: You should be live.

195
00:52:55,817 --> 00:52:56,238
[SPEAKER_27]: Is that good?

196
00:52:56,338 --> 00:52:56,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

197
00:52:57,697 --> 00:52:59,598
[SPEAKER_27]: I live at 146 Pine Ridge Road.

198
00:53:00,158 --> 00:53:08,242
[SPEAKER_27]: Good evening, members of the City Council Governance Committee, Chair Tseng, fellow members of the Charter Review Committee, and Medford community members.

199
00:53:09,023 --> 00:53:12,004
[SPEAKER_27]: As you know, I served on the school committee for 32 years.

200
00:53:12,724 --> 00:53:20,688
[SPEAKER_27]: I asked to be appointed to the Charter Review Committee when I realized there was no one with school committee experience on the Charter Review Committee.

201
00:53:21,349 --> 00:53:26,371
[SPEAKER_27]: While some of my former school committee colleagues may not agree with what we have put forth in the draft,

202
00:53:26,811 --> 00:53:39,057
[SPEAKER_27]: that you are reviewing tonight, rest assured that it has been put forth with deep reflection, not only my own, but with the very diligent subcommittee and the entire Charter Review Committee.

203
00:53:41,647 --> 00:53:53,574
[SPEAKER_27]: As someone who served with three different mayors, I strongly advocated for the mayor, whoever it might be, to remain as the school committee chair because the advantages are so strong.

204
00:53:54,334 --> 00:53:59,397
[SPEAKER_27]: As a school committee member, I had access to the mayor at every meeting.

205
00:54:00,178 --> 00:54:09,503
[SPEAKER_27]: Not just me, every school committee member had the advantage of being able to discuss key educational issues in front of the mayor.

206
00:54:11,883 --> 00:54:20,868
[SPEAKER_27]: being present at the school committee meetings ensures that the mayor is familiar with all the issues in detail and has buy-in.

207
00:54:21,848 --> 00:54:40,639
[SPEAKER_27]: Our charter subcommittee interviewed all three mayors and each underscored how important it has been or is for them to fully comprehend school committee issues, our school issues, especially given the significant percentage of the budget which is spent on education.

208
00:54:41,699 --> 00:54:51,762
[SPEAKER_27]: I remember the frustration of my colleagues across the aisle, that is you, the city council members, in former years when mayors did not come before them.

209
00:54:52,302 --> 00:54:54,463
[SPEAKER_27]: You never heard that from school committee members.

210
00:54:55,203 --> 00:54:58,984
[SPEAKER_27]: We worked closely with the mayors and they had buy-in.

211
00:54:59,804 --> 00:55:07,651
[SPEAKER_27]: To my former colleagues eager to do away with the role of the mayor as the chair of the school committee, I can only say be careful what you ask for.

212
00:55:08,311 --> 00:55:22,803
[SPEAKER_27]: School committee members play a very vital role in supporting all students and education, and that is enhanced when the mayor who recommends the budget is not distanced from the intricacy of the issues that become before the committee.

213
00:55:23,707 --> 00:55:31,172
[SPEAKER_27]: Remember, the mayor only gets one vote, not more, not less, than any other member.

214
00:55:32,592 --> 00:55:33,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

215
00:55:33,733 --> 00:55:37,375
[SPEAKER_27]: Later, I hope to perhaps address some of the other issues.

216
00:55:37,856 --> 00:55:38,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

217
00:55:39,116 --> 00:55:41,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, former school committee member, Vanna Kloot.

218
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:47,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have any other members' comments from the public?

219
00:55:49,266 --> 00:55:52,829
[SPEAKER_09]: Please feel free to line up behind the mic.

220
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:59,233
[SPEAKER_09]: I do see that member Olopade from the school community has joined us on Zoom as well.

221
00:55:59,593 --> 00:56:01,114
[SPEAKER_09]: We will take your comment after.

222
00:56:01,575 --> 00:56:01,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

223
00:56:02,115 --> 00:56:03,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address for the record, please.

224
00:56:03,196 --> 00:56:05,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Ron Givino, 326 East Border Road.

225
00:56:06,338 --> 00:56:10,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Just quickly, data is data.

226
00:56:10,381 --> 00:56:10,861
[SPEAKER_07]: It can go

227
00:56:11,682 --> 00:56:13,143
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we talk about survey.

228
00:56:13,743 --> 00:56:15,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Survey can favor you.

229
00:56:15,104 --> 00:56:19,467
[SPEAKER_07]: It can, and next week it's too small a data sample size.

230
00:56:19,927 --> 00:56:21,528
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have to be careful about that.

231
00:56:21,988 --> 00:56:30,514
[SPEAKER_07]: I would also say that this committee spent two years with data that was given to us from the citizens.

232
00:56:31,374 --> 00:56:35,237
[SPEAKER_07]: The input that we used to make this was not anybody's agenda.

233
00:56:35,297 --> 00:56:40,400
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just that data that we developed and heard the citizens.

234
00:56:41,348 --> 00:56:49,030
[SPEAKER_07]: I think what happens is, the number one goal for us was take the faces off of the people sitting behind the rail.

235
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:52,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Take the faces off the people that we're trying to create this charter for.

236
00:56:53,231 --> 00:57:07,975
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would also, just in closing, say to take a look at Superintendent Edward Vincent's interview, which hasn't been referenced yet, and Mr. Roy Belson's as well, that praises the Chief Executive Officer,

237
00:57:08,869 --> 00:57:14,872
[SPEAKER_07]: as a person who needs to be in charge of the whole city all the time.

238
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:23,676
[SPEAKER_07]: It was our opinion, you know, that the chief executive officer is gonna know about the school committee.

239
00:57:23,896 --> 00:57:27,478
[SPEAKER_07]: And whoever that is, is the chief executive officer.

240
00:57:27,498 --> 00:57:37,623
[SPEAKER_07]: So to me, all these names that we're throwing out with opinions, I think Belson and Edward Vincent are two names that, you know, support having the mayor

241
00:57:38,752 --> 00:57:40,434
[SPEAKER_07]: on the committee and as chair.

242
00:57:40,574 --> 00:57:46,580
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want, I'm talking to the people at home at this point.

243
00:57:46,781 --> 00:57:47,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are facts as well.

244
00:57:48,723 --> 00:57:49,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for your comment.

245
00:57:50,525 --> 00:57:55,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Alternating over to Zoom, member Olopade, I'm gonna ask you to unmute.

246
00:57:57,232 --> 00:57:59,495
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can give me your name and address for the record, please.

247
00:58:00,638 --> 00:58:02,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much, and thank you to the broader city council.

248
00:58:03,019 --> 00:58:05,720
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Aaron Olopade, current school committee member.

249
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:09,321
[SPEAKER_04]: My address is 105 Brooks Street in Medford, Mass.

250
00:58:11,002 --> 00:58:14,403
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to add a quick comment, I believe.

251
00:58:14,503 --> 00:58:27,428
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that the continued structure of the mayor serving as both the chair and a voting member of the school committee, I believe that there is a clear conflict to a certain degree.

252
00:58:29,095 --> 00:58:32,877
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it undermines the committee's ability to function, I think, as an independent governing body.

253
00:58:32,897 --> 00:58:45,722
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the fundamental role of the school committee is to advocate solely for the educational needs of Medford's children, free from competing municipal interests, budget constraints, or even political considerations for that matter.

254
00:58:45,742 --> 00:58:50,444
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a strong working relationship between the mayor and the school committee is essential.

255
00:58:50,964 --> 00:58:53,406
[SPEAKER_04]: to ensure collaboration and alignment.

256
00:58:53,907 --> 00:59:03,215
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the dual role of the mayor as both a voting member and the chief executive of the city creates kind of an unavoidable tension between these two responsibilities.

257
00:59:04,215 --> 00:59:14,584
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that the mayor's voting power can unduly influence, might be the word, decisions related to the school funding, contract negotiations even, or policy priorities.

258
00:59:15,825 --> 00:59:23,947
[SPEAKER_04]: areas where the interests of the city government, you know, and the needs of the school district don't automatically align may open up the opportunity for a misalignment.

259
00:59:24,847 --> 00:59:37,269
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, you know, I do recognize the arguments that have been made both in the charter and by members of the larger city as having the mayor continue as the chair in that leadership role.

260
00:59:37,289 --> 00:59:43,110
[SPEAKER_04]: It was both, as I mentioned, the chief executive of the city and having a legitimate participation in the school's decision.

261
00:59:43,770 --> 00:59:48,711
[SPEAKER_04]: but having them act as a voting member feels like there's an opportunity for there to be a misalignment.

262
00:59:49,391 --> 00:59:52,472
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do believe that there is an opportunity for us to consider that.

263
00:59:53,132 --> 01:00:03,274
[SPEAKER_04]: The decisions that is made ultimately is up to the greater council right now and I do recognize the amount of work and effort as mentioned previously by a current member in the audience.

264
01:00:03,875 --> 01:00:05,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Multiple years have been put in to make this

265
01:00:06,255 --> 01:00:08,537
[SPEAKER_04]: revision revised charter come to light.

266
01:00:08,577 --> 01:00:10,338
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm very proud of them for doing that.

267
01:00:10,358 --> 01:00:11,359
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thank them for their work.

268
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:17,162
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do believe there is an opportunity to reconsider this component of the revision of revised charter so far.

269
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:18,183
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are my comments.

270
01:00:18,363 --> 01:00:18,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

271
01:00:20,284 --> 01:00:21,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Member Olopade.

272
01:00:22,365 --> 01:00:24,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Going back to the chambers, name and address for the record, please.

273
01:00:29,529 --> 01:00:29,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it on?

274
01:00:30,029 --> 01:00:30,229
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

275
01:00:30,329 --> 01:00:31,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.

276
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:33,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Sharon Hayes, 69 Ripley Road.

277
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:35,311
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a former school committee member.

278
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:41,193
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to add what I said in my interview with the charter committee.

279
01:00:41,973 --> 01:00:46,034
[SPEAKER_03]: I do advocate for not having the mayor be the chair of the school committee.

280
01:00:46,734 --> 01:00:49,155
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I do believe she should be on the school committee.

281
01:00:49,275 --> 01:00:54,437
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's critical to have her there, to have her hearing everything that we're talking about.

282
01:00:54,497 --> 01:00:58,478
[SPEAKER_03]: The school budget is the single largest piece of the city budget.

283
01:00:58,938 --> 01:01:08,608
[SPEAKER_03]: So to not have our chief executive there to hear what is going on in the school, to hear what the school committee is thinking about, I think would be a huge gap.

284
01:01:08,969 --> 01:01:13,653
[SPEAKER_03]: I think having her on as a voting member, her again as member Bramley,

285
01:01:14,594 --> 01:01:17,656
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saying her because our current chief executive is a female.

286
01:01:18,976 --> 01:01:21,857
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's important to have the vote there from the mayor.

287
01:01:22,258 --> 01:01:28,080
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, however, as the chair of the school committee, the chair does guide the discussions.

288
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:31,642
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think that having a chair whose

289
01:01:33,317 --> 01:01:43,447
[SPEAKER_03]: whose focus isn't divided, whose focus is solely on the needs of the school and not necessarily having to contend with all of the other needs of the city is truly important.

290
01:01:43,547 --> 01:01:53,757
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, I personally advocated with the charter committee for having the mayor not be the chair to have the school committee elect a separate chair, but for the chair being a voting member of the school committee.

291
01:01:54,218 --> 01:01:54,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

292
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:56,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

293
01:01:58,216 --> 01:02:05,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have any other members or comments from members of the public on the mayor being chair of the school committee?

294
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:13,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, I do see President Behrs has requested to speak.

295
01:02:14,923 --> 01:02:16,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Chair Tsang.

296
01:02:17,004 --> 01:02:24,187
[SPEAKER_06]: I think just to apply the discussion that we've had here and what we've heard from everybody,

297
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:34,871
[SPEAKER_06]: The most important thing that I think we need to remember is there are two, essentially two organizations.

298
01:02:35,938 --> 01:02:38,619
[SPEAKER_06]: in Medford that make up the government of Medford.

299
01:02:38,639 --> 01:02:40,920
[SPEAKER_06]: There's the city of Medford and there's the Medford Public Schools.

300
01:02:41,521 --> 01:02:59,409
[SPEAKER_06]: The chief executive officer of the Medford Public Schools is the superintendent of the Medford Public Schools, who is appointed by the school committee, which serves a combined executive legislative function, which is different than the city council, which serves a legislative function only with the executive function of the city in the role and the hands of the mayor.

301
01:03:00,628 --> 01:03:22,164
[SPEAKER_06]: When we have a mayor who is the chair of the school committee, chairing, guiding the executive committee, who oversees then the superintendent, who is the appointed chief executive, you essentially have, I think, what is that, what former member Hayes said, that divided division of attention between the two organizations.

302
01:03:22,204 --> 01:03:24,967
[SPEAKER_06]: There's an assumption that the mayor can run the schools.

303
01:03:25,767 --> 01:03:29,230
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it actually, in many ways, can disempower a superintendent.

304
01:03:30,162 --> 01:03:39,844
[SPEAKER_06]: to have a mayor, not just being the chief executive of the city of Medford, but also being the chair of the executive committee of the Medford Public Schools.

305
01:03:41,645 --> 01:03:53,568
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not speaking to this mayor or the last mayor or the mayor before in any specific way, but exercising, whether intentionally or unintentionally, powers beyond the role of a member of the school committee.

306
01:03:55,128 --> 01:03:57,229
[SPEAKER_06]: And that, I think, is the fundamental question here.

307
01:03:58,103 --> 01:04:09,647
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to understand that there are two institutions that we're talking about, the city of Medford, which is governed by the mayor and the city council, and the Medford Public Schools, which is governed by the school committee.

308
01:04:10,567 --> 01:04:25,853
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the arguments made that having the mayor serve as the chair of the school committee creates potential conflicts or division of attention or whatever other frame or set of words we want to put to it.

309
01:04:27,378 --> 01:04:27,898
[SPEAKER_06]: is valid.

310
01:04:28,679 --> 01:04:44,333
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would move, make a motion that we amend the draft charter to keep the mayor as a serving voting member of the school committee, but not serving as the chair and to update the sections as needed to reflect that change.

311
01:04:46,795 --> 01:04:48,977
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a motion from President Behrs.

312
01:04:49,197 --> 01:04:51,500
[SPEAKER_09]: I also see, I recognize Councilor

313
01:04:53,417 --> 01:04:53,757
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

314
01:04:54,198 --> 01:04:59,364
[SPEAKER_26]: I just want to say one more time that I don't have a problem with the strong mayor system.

315
01:04:59,544 --> 01:05:04,350
[SPEAKER_26]: Many cities in Massachusetts have strong mayor systems.

316
01:05:04,390 --> 01:05:09,756
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that we have already sort of moved through that section of this charter, and we've said, yes, that's fine.

317
01:05:09,916 --> 01:05:10,977
[SPEAKER_26]: We have a strong mayor system.

318
01:05:11,037 --> 01:05:11,438
[SPEAKER_26]: That's fine.

319
01:05:12,161 --> 01:05:32,317
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, it's just, you can have a strong mayor, uh, and you can have a legislative system in the city and you can have a school committee, but when you also give the mayor, uh, access to the school committee to this level, I think it's too, I think it's too much is, is where I think I'm falling on this.

320
01:05:32,477 --> 01:05:33,138
[SPEAKER_26]: And because.

321
01:05:34,427 --> 01:06:02,198
[SPEAKER_26]: If we are picking and choosing the things in the data that we want to agree with and disagree with, I mean, it's hard to say what parts of the research and the surveys and the whole thing, I think we have to, as a city council, we have to look

322
01:06:03,623 --> 01:06:06,265
[SPEAKER_26]: carefully at what makes the most sense for the city.

323
01:06:06,425 --> 01:06:13,912
[SPEAKER_26]: We had a mayor for a very long time, um, in Medford, and, you know, we're still seeing some of the impacts of that.

324
01:06:14,212 --> 01:06:24,400
[SPEAKER_26]: And, uh, you know, I think we have to bear that in mind as we review this charter, and some of that is influencing the way that I'm looking at it.

325
01:06:24,961 --> 01:06:26,042
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, thank you.

326
01:06:27,623 --> 01:06:28,784
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Zaro.

327
01:06:29,124 --> 01:06:32,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, are there any other comments before we take the motion?

328
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:34,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

329
01:06:35,961 --> 01:06:36,641
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Scarpelli.

330
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:57,895
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, I bring to the fact that it's contradictory to the fact that we support a strong mayor form of government, but at the same time, you want to cut their legs off and in a position where that holds the biggest budget in this community.

331
01:06:58,695 --> 01:07:04,379
[SPEAKER_20]: In essence, what you're doing is putting the mayor to the side and saying,

332
01:07:05,244 --> 01:07:08,806
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to work with what we think is right and plow through it.

333
01:07:09,507 --> 01:07:11,167
[SPEAKER_20]: And the checks and balances are gone.

334
01:07:11,187 --> 01:07:13,008
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that's what happens.

335
01:07:13,449 --> 01:07:15,150
[SPEAKER_20]: I've sat with three different mayors.

336
01:07:15,850 --> 01:07:16,791
[SPEAKER_20]: I've seen it happen.

337
01:07:17,531 --> 01:07:25,996
[SPEAKER_20]: And having a strong council with a strong mayor that's leading the city will pay dividends.

338
01:07:26,696 --> 01:07:33,580
[SPEAKER_20]: Unfortunately, as I read a lot of what my colleagues on the school committee

339
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:40,440
[SPEAKER_20]: have said and what I've heard tonight is very simple that it seems like it's more ego driven.

340
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:53,450
[SPEAKER_20]: It seems like it's a little more power driven and I don't think it's really driven behind what's best for the school and the city because ultimately having the mayor chairing that committee

341
01:07:54,968 --> 01:08:06,633
[SPEAKER_20]: It's that checks and balance, that person at the top that's saying, we know what the school committee needs, but at the same time, we have those balances from the city side, right?

342
01:08:07,353 --> 01:08:17,538
[SPEAKER_20]: So what we have now by eliminating that process is truly eliminating a big piece of the process.

343
01:08:18,438 --> 01:08:20,739
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, it's just,

344
01:08:26,872 --> 01:08:35,220
[SPEAKER_20]: It's going to be interesting where the vote falls tonight, and it'll be interesting where the vote falls, the community as a whole, and then in the final vote.

345
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:44,628
[SPEAKER_20]: It's going to be interesting because, my mother used to say, if it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck, it's a duck.

346
01:08:45,837 --> 01:08:57,565
[SPEAKER_20]: So if you see the votes changing and you have six members all in tow, because that's what I've read so far from my colleagues across the board, it seems like everything is in tow.

347
01:08:58,505 --> 01:09:06,511
[SPEAKER_20]: And it reflects back to the ward representation piece that even from their platform, they've diverted.

348
01:09:08,948 --> 01:09:18,636
[SPEAKER_20]: it's gone totally against what was originally created for a community group to do its due diligence and to see what they've done and brought forward.

349
01:09:18,656 --> 01:09:32,508
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not saying that we shouldn't make changes if we see changes, but so far what I've heard are really damaging changes for one demographic.

350
01:09:34,159 --> 01:09:37,581
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'll be interesting to see how the vote goes.

351
01:09:37,841 --> 01:09:38,701
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

352
01:09:39,302 --> 01:09:40,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

353
01:09:41,043 --> 01:09:46,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to mention, just to note the vote on war representation was not 6-1.

354
01:09:46,885 --> 01:09:52,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it didn't go through the whole committee, but also was not everyone besides one councilor.

355
01:09:54,529 --> 01:09:55,950
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a motion on the floor.

356
01:09:57,771 --> 01:09:59,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a second for that motion?

357
01:10:01,842 --> 01:10:03,863
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a second from Councilor Zaro.

358
01:10:04,903 --> 01:10:07,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, can you please hold the roll?

359
01:10:07,824 --> 01:10:08,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

360
01:10:12,805 --> 01:10:15,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, President Burrs, would you be able to?

361
01:10:16,926 --> 01:10:23,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to not have the mayor serve as the chair of the school committee, but to remain as a voting member of the school committee.

362
01:10:24,248 --> 01:10:27,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Further motion to update all relevant sections of the charter to reflect this change.

363
01:10:36,405 --> 01:10:37,425
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Collins?

364
01:10:39,546 --> 01:10:39,786
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

365
01:10:42,506 --> 01:10:43,287
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Lazzaro?

366
01:10:44,007 --> 01:10:44,227
Yes.

367
01:10:45,487 --> 01:10:46,187
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Lemming?

368
01:10:47,527 --> 01:10:48,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, he's not in the meeting.

369
01:10:48,488 --> 01:10:48,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

370
01:10:51,388 --> 01:10:52,208
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Scapelli?

371
01:10:52,629 --> 01:10:52,889
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

372
01:10:55,189 --> 01:10:57,370
[SPEAKER_21]: And Chair Singh?

373
01:10:57,570 --> 01:10:57,770
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

374
01:10:58,150 --> 01:11:00,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Four in the affirmative, one in the negative.

375
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:02,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, oh, sorry.

376
01:11:03,151 --> 01:11:03,731
[SPEAKER_09]: President Behrs?

377
01:11:05,898 --> 01:11:07,619
[SPEAKER_09]: 4 in affirmative, 1 in the negative.

378
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:08,600
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

379
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:09,761
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I just read your thing.

380
01:11:12,423 --> 01:11:21,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have any comments from counselors on ward representation for the schools?

381
01:11:21,130 --> 01:11:24,092
[SPEAKER_09]: I have some comments from sitting school committee members.

382
01:11:27,615 --> 01:11:30,117
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw President Behrs first and then Councilor Lazaro.

383
01:11:34,333 --> 01:11:40,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you chair saying my really my only comment on this is that I think this is a great structure.

384
01:11:41,915 --> 01:11:45,056
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why I think it should apply across the board.

385
01:11:45,096 --> 01:11:46,736
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why those were the proposals that I made.

386
01:11:46,956 --> 01:11:57,098
[SPEAKER_06]: So I really appreciate the work of the charter study committee and developing this approach to local representation here in our community.

387
01:11:57,258 --> 01:11:57,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

388
01:11:58,939 --> 01:11:59,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

389
01:11:59,319 --> 01:12:00,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Recognizing council Zorro.

390
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:03,240
[SPEAKER_26]: I feel very

391
01:12:04,506 --> 01:12:08,928
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm frustrated by the comments.

392
01:12:09,928 --> 01:12:11,809
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not frustrated by the comments.

393
01:12:12,729 --> 01:12:13,470
[SPEAKER_26]: I misspoke there.

394
01:12:14,410 --> 01:12:30,217
[SPEAKER_26]: The comments that we received from the sitting school committee members this week on the clarity, I feel that I got from the way they spoke about the internal symmetry between

395
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:56,054
[SPEAKER_26]: the two bodies, the elected bodies in Medford, helped me understand the importance of the two, both the school committee and the city council reflecting each other and that I am frustrated by the fact that they are currently in this draft of the charter.

396
01:12:56,074 --> 01:12:58,956
[SPEAKER_26]: They're not matching and I'm not sure how to

397
01:13:04,114 --> 01:13:19,279
[SPEAKER_26]: Because the lines of the words don't match the schools, because the schools are four elementary schools and two middle schools and one high school, and you can't really assign a school committee member to a school, of course, and because that doesn't make sense anyway.

398
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:25,642
[SPEAKER_26]: Because students age out and these things just, that doesn't really align.

399
01:13:27,682 --> 01:13:28,162
[SPEAKER_26]: I think the,

400
01:13:30,676 --> 01:13:36,681
[SPEAKER_26]: importance of school committee and city council aligning with each other.

401
01:13:36,701 --> 01:13:41,405
[SPEAKER_26]: That's a valuable thing to mention.

402
01:13:43,987 --> 01:13:51,313
[SPEAKER_26]: School committee member Graham and school committee member Russo both mentioned that specifically in their comments, and I thought that was important to note on the floor.

403
01:13:53,615 --> 01:13:54,996
[SPEAKER_26]: So I just wanted to say that.

404
01:13:55,116 --> 01:13:55,336
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

405
01:13:56,691 --> 01:13:57,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Zaro.

406
01:13:58,172 --> 01:14:03,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have any other comments from council members before we move on to the comments from school committee members?

407
01:14:06,917 --> 01:14:16,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, are there any sitting school committee members either in person or online who'd like to comment on ward versus district representation for a school committee?

408
01:14:21,049 --> 01:14:29,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, I'm going to move to the sitting committee members' written comments first, and then I'll move on to public participation.

409
01:14:31,637 --> 01:14:35,440
[SPEAKER_09]: On ward representation, this is from Vice Chair Graham.

410
01:14:37,738 --> 01:14:47,120
[SPEAKER_09]: As the council considers their organization of the city into districts, I strongly urge that the boundaries for both the city council and school committee be aligned.

411
01:14:47,641 --> 01:14:49,221
[SPEAKER_09]: The government should work for its people.

412
01:14:49,301 --> 01:14:53,102
[SPEAKER_09]: The very first step in that process is in knowing who is there to support you.

413
01:14:53,622 --> 01:14:58,503
[SPEAKER_09]: Having two different structures will be confusing and I can't see the value it will provide to our residents.

414
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:05,365
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree that the school committee should continue to be comprised of seven and would support such a size for the council as well.

415
01:15:06,276 --> 01:15:14,221
[SPEAKER_09]: The current proposal, with its focus on district-based school representation, does not fully account for the practical realities of our school system.

416
01:15:14,662 --> 01:15:22,046
[SPEAKER_09]: At the middle and high school levels, every school committee member is responsible for decisions affecting all students, regardless of district.

417
01:15:22,507 --> 01:15:27,050
[SPEAKER_09]: This effectively makes their role smaller to that of an at-large member, serving all students.

418
01:15:27,810 --> 01:15:39,454
[SPEAKER_09]: At the elementary school level, the reality is that students often attend schools that fall outside the boundaries of their proposed district, pushing the responsibility for those students onto at-large members.

419
01:15:40,095 --> 01:15:46,157
[SPEAKER_09]: This model does not reflect the interconnectedness of the issues we face across all grade levels and undermines the unity of the community.

420
01:15:46,777 --> 01:15:50,619
[SPEAKER_09]: Our community cannot afford to deepen the divisions between our schools.

421
01:15:51,139 --> 01:15:56,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Medford students deserve equal opportunities for high quality education regardless of where they live.

422
01:15:56,441 --> 01:16:03,484
[SPEAKER_09]: A district based approach could risk exacerbating existing tensions between our school communities, something we are actively working to bridge.

423
01:16:04,084 --> 01:16:13,968
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have perfect answers here because I am very interested in increasing representation of our elected officials and ensuring all corners of our city are reflected in our school committee.

424
01:16:14,881 --> 01:16:20,786
[SPEAKER_09]: I am further interested in creating pathways to service that are not as prohibitively expensive for candidates.

425
01:16:21,086 --> 01:16:26,730
[SPEAKER_09]: I simply highlight that achieving the goals of representation will present other practical problems.

426
01:16:28,431 --> 01:16:34,396
[SPEAKER_09]: I have this following comment from member Rousseau.

427
01:16:34,956 --> 01:16:44,203
[SPEAKER_09]: The structure of the school committee and city council should be consistent, whether it is entirely at-large, entirely ward-based, or a combination of district, ward, plus at-large members.

428
01:16:44,783 --> 01:16:52,531
[SPEAKER_09]: While I do not have a strong preference for a specific model, the district two or plus three at large members model seems reasonable.

429
01:16:53,072 --> 01:17:03,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Regardless of the chosen model, it should mirror the council structure to avoid confusion among voters who already struggle to understand our government structure without multiple formats within a single city.

430
01:17:04,225 --> 01:17:09,128
[SPEAKER_09]: A child growing up next door to me will attend one elementary school, one middle school, and our one high school.

431
01:17:09,508 --> 01:17:13,010
[SPEAKER_09]: The physical location of these schools is irrelevant for representation.

432
01:17:13,451 --> 01:17:15,192
[SPEAKER_09]: What matters is where the resident lives.

433
01:17:16,011 --> 01:17:23,075
[SPEAKER_09]: A school located in my ward is no more, quote, my school than any other when it comes to representing my constituents.

434
01:17:23,756 --> 01:17:36,483
[SPEAKER_09]: There may be an instinctual belief that ward-based school committee representation offers something unique compared to at-large representation, but this does not hold up when considering a resident's perspective as their child progresses through the school system.

435
01:17:36,723 --> 01:17:41,407
[SPEAKER_09]: No elected official can reside in a ward or district encompassing all the schools a child will attend.

436
01:17:41,767 --> 01:17:45,911
[SPEAKER_09]: So there is no logical basis for arguments centered on the physical location of schools.

437
01:17:47,094 --> 01:17:54,560
[SPEAKER_09]: From member Ntapa, I have, in regards to the combined ward representation, I feel conflicted.

438
01:17:54,761 --> 01:18:01,766
[SPEAKER_09]: As an independent candidate, only having to campaign physically in my respective territory is a significant financial and time advantage.

439
01:18:01,987 --> 01:18:06,470
[SPEAKER_09]: That, however, should not be the driving factor in implementing ward or combined ward representation.

440
01:18:06,971 --> 01:18:10,754
[SPEAKER_09]: I only acknowledge this as fact and my immediate reaction to that change.

441
01:18:11,395 --> 01:18:17,668
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we also need to do important work to acknowledge that even though members may represent different word combinations.

442
01:18:18,452 --> 01:18:24,175
[SPEAKER_09]: that the members do not only represent those within that district that attend said schools.

443
01:18:24,515 --> 01:18:28,077
[SPEAKER_09]: Ward representation makes more sense to me for the city council.

444
01:18:28,137 --> 01:18:38,782
[SPEAKER_09]: However, I feel the implementation of a majority ward-based representation school committee could make it easier for community members to relay their concerns to at least one designated individual.

445
01:18:39,142 --> 01:18:40,683
[SPEAKER_09]: It almost feels more personalized.

446
01:18:41,123 --> 01:18:41,643
[SPEAKER_09]: I digress.

447
01:18:42,483 --> 01:18:45,365
[SPEAKER_09]: I also see member Olopade has his hand raised on Zoom.

448
01:18:46,365 --> 01:18:47,806
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll ask you to unmute.

449
01:18:50,772 --> 01:18:54,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you again, Aaron Olopade, 105 Brook Street, for the record.

450
01:18:56,135 --> 01:19:02,017
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, like I think many of my school committee colleagues' comments that were just made, I think I'm also conflicted.

451
01:19:02,157 --> 01:19:07,500
[SPEAKER_04]: I see the merits for both systems, both an at-large or award-based representation system.

452
01:19:08,661 --> 01:19:13,885
[SPEAKER_04]: I think ultimately ward-based representation has its merits for sure.

453
01:19:14,485 --> 01:19:23,933
[SPEAKER_04]: I think particularly ensuring that all neighborhoods in any given area or city have a direct voice in the governance of a city, school-wise especially in this conversation.

454
01:19:24,793 --> 01:19:31,659
[SPEAKER_04]: I think in many cities and certain communities, you know, those I think in some ways like Medford that have historically underrepresented

455
01:19:32,119 --> 01:19:40,253
[SPEAKER_04]: and potentially marginalized communities may struggle to have their concerns heard and at large systems where candidates often come from

456
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:44,341
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe more politically active or maybe more engaged areas of the city.

457
01:19:45,022 --> 01:19:56,609
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this structure helps promote like geographical diversity and decision making skills, ensuring that no single part of the city dominates the decision that we are having if you are operating off that system.

458
01:19:57,370 --> 01:20:02,693
[SPEAKER_04]: That being said, though, I think a war representation sole system for a local school community can create challenges.

459
01:20:03,213 --> 01:20:05,997
[SPEAKER_04]: and ensuring equitable governance and effective decision making skills.

460
01:20:06,758 --> 01:20:11,904
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, as I mentioned, you know, war representation is often designed to give a voice to different neighborhoods.

461
01:20:12,565 --> 01:20:16,630
[SPEAKER_04]: It can also lead to fragmented approaching when it comes to educational policy.

462
01:20:17,451 --> 01:20:19,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Education, as we know, is a citywide

463
01:20:19,753 --> 01:20:21,794
[SPEAKER_04]: issue that requires, I think, a unified vision.

464
01:20:22,514 --> 01:20:29,257
[SPEAKER_04]: But ward-based representation can encourage, maybe let's call it a more parochial mindset, depending on the conversation that we're having.

465
01:20:29,817 --> 01:20:32,438
[SPEAKER_04]: I think both, as I mentioned, have their merits.

466
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:38,800
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, ultimately, I do believe that the City Council and School Committee should be similar in the way that they're structured.

467
01:20:39,220 --> 01:20:46,626
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if the decision is that city council is going to be both wards and at large, I think the school committee should follow in the same manner.

468
01:20:47,246 --> 01:21:00,396
[SPEAKER_04]: But ultimately, I think it's the decision of the people and how each system ultimately avails the citizens to the voices that are needed to, I think, impact the students the best way.

469
01:21:00,776 --> 01:21:01,657
[SPEAKER_04]: So, thank you.

470
01:21:03,105 --> 01:21:04,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, member Olpade.

471
01:21:05,046 --> 01:21:07,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on to public participation.

472
01:21:07,167 --> 01:21:08,748
[SPEAKER_09]: I know I saw some hands in the crowd.

473
01:21:10,289 --> 01:21:13,150
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're on Zoom again, please raise your hand so I can see it.

474
01:21:13,730 --> 01:21:15,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address for the record, please.

475
01:21:18,493 --> 01:21:18,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sorry.

476
01:21:21,174 --> 01:21:22,075
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I've done it.

477
01:21:24,368 --> 01:21:24,868
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a red.

478
01:21:24,928 --> 01:21:26,850
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yeah, you're live.

479
01:21:26,870 --> 01:21:28,791
[SPEAKER_00]: Milda McDonald, 61 Monument Street.

480
01:21:29,492 --> 01:21:37,778
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to make the point that because there's been discussion that the city council should mirror the school committee in its structure.

481
01:21:38,259 --> 01:21:41,501
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wanted to make the point that the two bodies are very different.

482
01:21:41,561 --> 01:21:43,003
[SPEAKER_00]: Their jobs are very different.

483
01:21:43,863 --> 01:21:51,909
[SPEAKER_00]: The city council legislates for the entire city, represents constituents across the city, and the school committee has a more narrow focus there.

484
01:21:53,031 --> 01:21:54,313
[SPEAKER_00]: Addressing only the school.

485
01:21:55,574 --> 01:21:58,198
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was one of the things that the committee considered.

486
01:21:58,539 --> 01:22:01,323
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not consider them the same because they're not the same.

487
01:22:04,075 --> 01:22:09,699
[SPEAKER_00]: Communities all across the state have different configurations for city council and school committee.

488
01:22:10,379 --> 01:22:18,424
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I think it's probably less common for a city to have the exact same structure for both bodies, but the call-in center could maybe correct me if I'm wrong on that.

489
01:22:19,905 --> 01:22:24,648
[SPEAKER_00]: There are plenty of communities that have ward councils and at-large school committees.

490
01:22:26,689 --> 01:22:28,891
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to make that point.

491
01:22:30,592 --> 01:22:33,694
[SPEAKER_00]: That was not something that the committee thought about because

492
01:22:34,354 --> 01:22:35,655
[SPEAKER_00]: simply because they're different bodies.

493
01:22:35,796 --> 01:22:42,862
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as voters getting confused, voters would have their ballots and their candidates would be on their ballots.

494
01:22:43,322 --> 01:22:51,709
[SPEAKER_00]: We have systems across the state and across the country where people living in the same community have different elected representatives.

495
01:22:51,769 --> 01:22:55,532
[SPEAKER_00]: Right here in Medford, our state reps, depending on where you live, are different.

496
01:22:56,093 --> 01:22:59,876
[SPEAKER_00]: So voters figure this kind of thing out all the time.

497
01:23:00,276 --> 01:23:00,577
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

498
01:23:10,298 --> 01:23:12,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Sharon Hayes, 69 Ripley Road, former school committee member.

499
01:23:12,943 --> 01:23:18,973
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to support everything that the chair of the Charter Committee just said, Milva said.

500
01:23:20,315 --> 01:23:21,217
[SPEAKER_03]: I find it somewhat

501
01:23:22,688 --> 01:23:36,855
[SPEAKER_03]: nonsensical and in some ways almost demeaning to the members of this community to suggest that they wouldn't understand different compositions of our two very different bodies, the school committee and the city council.

502
01:23:37,495 --> 01:23:40,276
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't even understand how that could come up as a reason.

503
01:23:40,596 --> 01:23:46,239
[SPEAKER_03]: They are two very different, they have two very different scopes of authority, of responsibility.

504
01:23:46,699 --> 01:23:46,979
[SPEAKER_03]: So I,

505
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:51,281
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even understand how that comes up as a question.

506
01:23:51,761 --> 01:24:05,407
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to make the point, too, that where divisions exist and distrust in our government exists, you can almost always trace it back to either a lack of representation or disproportionate representation.

507
01:24:06,661 --> 01:24:10,163
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what we are looking at is ways to increase representation.

508
01:24:11,064 --> 01:24:19,169
[SPEAKER_03]: What the Charter Committee has recommended across the board are ways that will increase representation among the people of this city.

509
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:31,658
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I'm continually hearing in the meetings that I've seen is a move backwards from this committee, this council, to look for ways to decrease that.

510
01:24:31,758 --> 01:24:33,939
[SPEAKER_03]: And I truly don't understand that.

511
01:24:38,061 --> 01:24:43,783
[SPEAKER_03]: I am totally in support of the way that the Charter Committee structured this.

512
01:24:44,203 --> 01:24:48,805
[SPEAKER_03]: I think obviously, as they've said countless times, they spent two years on this.

513
01:24:49,265 --> 01:24:51,986
[SPEAKER_03]: They spent two years researching this.

514
01:24:52,326 --> 01:24:59,669
[SPEAKER_03]: They spent two years getting community feedback that said across the board that the community wanted more input.

515
01:24:59,989 --> 01:25:03,931
[SPEAKER_03]: wanted more representation, wanted more to feel more connected.

516
01:25:04,331 --> 01:25:11,934
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I truly don't understand why we would suggest otherwise at this point.

517
01:25:12,054 --> 01:25:16,155
[SPEAKER_03]: If we go back to all at large, then nothing has changed.

518
01:25:16,255 --> 01:25:20,277
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the voice of the community, to my opinion, has been ignored.

519
01:25:20,837 --> 01:25:21,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

520
01:25:22,638 --> 01:25:23,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

521
01:25:23,498 --> 01:25:25,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ranley.

522
01:25:26,422 --> 01:25:28,303
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, Nicole Bramley, 54 Norwich Circle.

523
01:25:28,823 --> 01:25:32,444
[SPEAKER_23]: My comments are actually from member Ntapa whose Zoom is not working.

524
01:25:33,144 --> 01:25:35,245
[SPEAKER_23]: So he's asked me to speak for him if that's okay.

525
01:25:35,845 --> 01:25:38,106
[SPEAKER_23]: So John Ntapa, 12 Murray Hill Road.

526
01:25:38,126 --> 01:25:42,948
[SPEAKER_23]: It says, my apologies to the committee as Zoom is not working in my favor this evening.

527
01:25:43,528 --> 01:25:48,290
[SPEAKER_23]: After hearing my comments read aloud, thank you, Chair Seng, it is not clear to

528
01:25:49,643 --> 01:25:55,109
[SPEAKER_23]: It is not clear that my opinion leans more towards the opposition for majority word based representation.

529
01:25:55,690 --> 01:25:57,852
[SPEAKER_23]: This is despite my comments of appeal towards it.

530
01:25:58,353 --> 01:25:58,733
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

531
01:25:58,753 --> 01:26:00,816
[SPEAKER_23]: And that was it.

532
01:26:01,236 --> 01:26:04,480
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, and he thinks the valiant work of the chapter study committee.

533
01:26:05,821 --> 01:26:06,162
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

534
01:26:12,697 --> 01:26:14,558
[SPEAKER_01]: When Dixon 61 Monument Street.

535
01:26:15,478 --> 01:26:16,098
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really have.

536
01:26:16,999 --> 01:26:27,663
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to sort of re emphasize what they've said before in a perhaps a different way, using the districts for school committee.

537
01:26:29,784 --> 01:26:38,707
[SPEAKER_01]: is not about having a school in every district or that those councilor, those committee members will represent those schools in their district.

538
01:26:39,588 --> 01:26:47,571
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about representation, making sure that you have people on the committee that are from all parts of the city.

539
01:26:47,991 --> 01:26:48,891
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it's about.

540
01:26:49,211 --> 01:26:51,092
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no confusion about that.

541
01:26:52,713 --> 01:26:59,539
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I would just like to reiterate the voters' experience, even if there's wards

542
01:27:00,670 --> 01:27:05,234
[SPEAKER_01]: for the city council, districts, for the school committee.

543
01:27:06,175 --> 01:27:07,977
[SPEAKER_01]: The voter's experience is the same.

544
01:27:08,097 --> 01:27:09,698
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to go in, see a ballot.

545
01:27:09,738 --> 01:27:13,442
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to say, choose this many from the large list.

546
01:27:13,822 --> 01:27:18,046
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll say, choose this from your district for school committee.

547
01:27:18,066 --> 01:27:23,931
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll say, choose this person or that person for city council.

548
01:27:25,132 --> 01:27:25,673
[SPEAKER_01]: confusing.

549
01:27:25,693 --> 01:27:27,015
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be confusing.

550
01:27:27,215 --> 01:27:28,397
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same experience.

551
01:27:28,457 --> 01:27:32,723
[SPEAKER_01]: You see this ballot and you have a choice and it's laid out clearly.

552
01:27:33,203 --> 01:27:35,106
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see what's so confusing about that.

553
01:27:35,867 --> 01:27:36,648
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is, um,

554
01:27:39,084 --> 01:27:55,852
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be great to have ward representation for the school committee, but I believe that they didn't go with ward representation and went with the districts because you don't want to have a school committee with 11 people on it, which is what you would have to do if you went to ward representation.

555
01:27:55,912 --> 01:28:00,094
[SPEAKER_01]: So they broke it up into four districts, and that makes sense for the school committee.

556
01:28:00,434 --> 01:28:03,175
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make sense for the council.

557
01:28:06,217 --> 01:28:07,538
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those are my points.

558
01:28:10,485 --> 01:28:11,846
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, thank you.

559
01:28:12,546 --> 01:28:14,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Dixon.

560
01:28:14,027 --> 01:28:20,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other comments from the members of the public, either on Zoom or in person?

561
01:28:20,490 --> 01:28:22,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other comments from councillors?

562
01:28:29,087 --> 01:28:32,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Ron Givino, 326 East Border Road.

563
01:28:32,148 --> 01:28:34,208
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to keep it something simple.

564
01:28:34,248 --> 01:28:36,929
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, I'm talking to the public.

565
01:28:37,329 --> 01:28:46,092
[SPEAKER_07]: First off, when a public official is worried about the competency of the voter, an apology should be as public as that comment as well.

566
01:28:47,232 --> 01:28:49,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Secondly, understand the concept.

567
01:28:50,373 --> 01:28:57,895
[SPEAKER_07]: I think if four school committee people lived in the Roberts community,

568
01:28:58,848 --> 01:29:02,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you saying that the Roberts school is going to get all the attention?

569
01:29:02,410 --> 01:29:03,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course not.

570
01:29:04,171 --> 01:29:15,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Where the rep is has nothing to do with a specific, what it does do is it brings new blood, new energy, new ideas to a school committee that needs them.

571
01:29:15,999 --> 01:29:20,221
[SPEAKER_07]: And we heard clearly from the existing school committee, 11 is way too many to manage.

572
01:29:20,321 --> 01:29:20,882
[SPEAKER_07]: I get that.

573
01:29:22,395 --> 01:29:29,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody seems to be able to come up with a plan that unifies both groups, which I don't understand why that would be the case anyways.

574
01:29:29,539 --> 01:29:36,383
[SPEAKER_07]: But to think that if you're elected and you live on Salem Street, is that your only issues are on Salem Street?

575
01:29:36,423 --> 01:29:37,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course not.

576
01:29:37,544 --> 01:29:42,327
[SPEAKER_07]: And the fact is there are three reps probably that live in a neighborhood of one school.

577
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:44,460
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not thinking that way.

578
01:29:44,481 --> 01:29:46,341
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why we're thinking that way.

579
01:29:46,982 --> 01:30:00,267
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just to put new blood, which a lot of our interviews, past and present, said it would be nice if we had a chance to run a cheaper campaign, not have to worry about that, get more people involved, wake up the neighborhood.

580
01:30:00,527 --> 01:30:01,527
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we're doing here.

581
01:30:01,547 --> 01:30:06,269
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not saying, I want to make sure Roberts gets attention because Brooks gets all the attention.

582
01:30:06,449 --> 01:30:07,630
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't happen that way.

583
01:30:08,110 --> 01:30:12,253
[SPEAKER_07]: So simply put, the voters are smart enough to know, and that's why I'm speaking to.

584
01:30:12,633 --> 01:30:19,718
[SPEAKER_07]: And secondly, I want to say this, and I would have said this eventually, we put two years into this project.

585
01:30:20,258 --> 01:30:28,984
[SPEAKER_07]: If a report that came out 48 hours ago has more weight than the two-year project, then we should have just been told not to do the school committee section.

586
01:30:29,705 --> 01:30:30,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

587
01:30:38,644 --> 01:30:40,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Chair Seng.

588
01:30:43,607 --> 01:30:56,155
[SPEAKER_06]: I think what we're getting to here is suggestions that proposals come from not a place of good faith.

589
01:30:57,275 --> 01:31:00,297
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's toxic and I think that's divisive.

590
01:31:01,558 --> 01:31:02,659
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we all agree

591
01:31:04,135 --> 01:31:06,997
[SPEAKER_06]: that greater representation is a key goal of a new charter.

592
01:31:07,677 --> 01:31:13,341
[SPEAKER_06]: I've said that since the beginning of, before I even thought about running for office.

593
01:31:15,322 --> 01:31:19,264
[SPEAKER_06]: How we get to greater representation, we have an honest disagreement on.

594
01:31:20,745 --> 01:31:31,352
[SPEAKER_06]: I think when we talk about this question of voter competency, I don't think member Russo's questioning voter competency, I think it's,

595
01:31:32,377 --> 01:31:38,881
[SPEAKER_06]: completely unfair to say that the structure of government doesn't impact the ability of the voter to understand their government.

596
01:31:39,521 --> 01:31:41,222
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's a good faith comment.

597
01:31:43,023 --> 01:31:52,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, no one generally likes it when I say this, but I did go to school for this and I did study this and I have studied extensively models of government.

598
01:31:53,909 --> 01:32:01,013
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just not true to say that the way that a government is structured doesn't impact a person's understanding of how they participate with that government.

599
01:32:02,229 --> 01:32:10,698
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think it's true to say that everything in the Charter Study Committee's recommended draft is the perfect way to increase representation.

600
01:32:10,758 --> 01:32:14,282
[SPEAKER_06]: If we make any changes to it, then you're against increasing representation.

601
01:32:14,603 --> 01:32:15,564
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't think that's true.

602
01:32:15,584 --> 01:32:20,629
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we have honest disagreements about what it means to structure the government of the city of Medford.

603
01:32:21,330 --> 01:32:23,370
[SPEAKER_06]: and the governance body of the Medford Public Schools.

604
01:32:23,390 --> 01:32:28,131
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we have honest disagreements about what it means to have more representation.

605
01:32:28,151 --> 01:32:49,395
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to call you out here, Chair Seng, but you've said very directly, at least in some comments that I've heard recently, that as the one person of color sitting on this committee, who I think does deeply value racial diversity and representation, and also has studied this maybe at a better school than me for more time than me more recently than me,

606
01:32:50,694 --> 01:32:54,596
[SPEAKER_06]: that you don't necessarily agree that what was proposed achieves the goal.

607
01:32:56,276 --> 01:32:57,317
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an honest disagreement.

608
01:32:58,797 --> 01:32:59,738
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the process.

609
01:32:59,798 --> 01:33:06,620
[SPEAKER_06]: The study committee has put together its recommendation, this council, and as a councillor, this is my job.

610
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:13,123
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to put my name and my vote to a recommended charter that will go to the mayor, that will go to the people, and the people will vote.

611
01:33:14,775 --> 01:33:28,860
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't come at this from any other position than I am making the proposals and thoughts that I think will create a structure of government that advances and increases representation for the people and that will serve this community for years to come.

612
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:42,244
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think if we go as we have been the past few meetings down this road, that it is not from that perspective that we are all approaching this fine, but that's what's toxic and divisive.

613
01:33:42,304 --> 01:33:44,405
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what's going to make it harder to pass the charter.

614
01:33:46,225 --> 01:33:51,928
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, as I said, in my remarks to the state of the city, I cannot wait to vote on a new charter for the city.

615
01:33:51,968 --> 01:33:54,069
[SPEAKER_06]: The charter that we have now does not work.

616
01:33:55,489 --> 01:34:10,316
[SPEAKER_06]: I really deeply appreciate the work of the study committee to put together a proposal that I think by and large, even if every change I wanted to make, which is not going to happen because that's not how this works, 90% of it would remain intact with no changes at all.

617
01:34:11,846 --> 01:34:23,357
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're going to end up with a good product out of this committee, a good product out of committee of the whole good product out of the council that will go to the mayor that will go to the legislature who I have spoken to who said this is going to move forward.

618
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:27,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Your changes are not out of the scope of this process.

619
01:34:29,652 --> 01:34:31,433
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hope that that's the result that we get.

620
01:34:31,633 --> 01:34:47,280
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think the more that we have the conversation with the idea that this body should not be able to, or should not make specific changes because they are for some reason other than the reason that people are stating, that's what's going to derail this process.

621
01:34:47,340 --> 01:34:53,963
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, we have an honest disagreement about how to increase representation and what a new charter looks like.

622
01:34:55,223 --> 01:35:20,268
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm putting forward what I believe increases representation based on the research of everything that I've read, which includes the entire study committee report, my five years of experience serving on this council, my 10 years service experience in state and local government in this community, my four years of education on political systems and structures, and the opinions that we're hearing from the people who are speaking here.

623
01:35:22,380 --> 01:35:30,542
[SPEAKER_06]: We can keep going down the road and we can keep ascribing motive to people that are not the motives that they have, but I don't think it gets us anywhere.

624
01:35:30,742 --> 01:35:31,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

625
01:35:33,703 --> 01:35:34,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

626
01:35:35,764 --> 01:35:37,824
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Chairperson Sang.

627
01:35:37,864 --> 01:35:44,526
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that when it fits a dialogue, the speech can follow.

628
01:35:46,380 --> 01:36:00,483
[SPEAKER_20]: What to defend it when I have members of the revolution Medford responding that a platform that they ran on that my colleagues ran on clearly stated ward representation.

629
01:36:01,677 --> 01:36:29,835
[SPEAKER_20]: And one of the big things that as I started researching to change my mind, that helped me change my mind to what I needed to learn about ward representation, I thought was the piece that I think it's disingenuous to say that's not true, but to have a more diverse population and giving people an opportunity that normally wouldn't have the opportunity to run

630
01:36:30,436 --> 01:36:34,539
[SPEAKER_20]: in a system we have today.

631
01:36:35,340 --> 01:36:47,750
[SPEAKER_20]: So having every ward represented and my colleagues can say I'm wrong and say a lie to put words in their mouths, but it was said in the past that there are some wards that are so small that shouldn't be represented.

632
01:36:48,531 --> 01:36:59,300
[SPEAKER_20]: And that I wanted to make sure when I went back and looked at that video, that that was said and understanding that what I believe Mr. Gimeno said is creating more life.

633
01:37:00,278 --> 01:37:08,344
[SPEAKER_20]: Those wards that have been underrepresented are those wards that haven't come out to vote because they don't feel like they're part of the process.

634
01:37:08,364 --> 01:37:09,805
[SPEAKER_20]: They don't feel like they're part of the community.

635
01:37:10,165 --> 01:37:11,186
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's a huge divide.

636
01:37:14,388 --> 01:37:28,999
[SPEAKER_20]: So I just think that the key piece that keeps coming back in so many issues in our community is our, it's very simple that the question that keeps coming back

637
01:37:30,930 --> 01:37:49,715
[SPEAKER_20]: are the people that we elected, are the people that are sitting on the council floor, the people that are sitting in the school committee floor, are they really listening to us, the community, not 7500 people, not people like minded, but are they listening to the whole community?

638
01:37:52,396 --> 01:37:53,937
[SPEAKER_20]: And this isn't divisive.

639
01:37:54,437 --> 01:37:54,937
[SPEAKER_20]: This is just

640
01:37:56,385 --> 01:38:00,669
[SPEAKER_20]: Like I said, like Lily Scott Pelly said, quacks like a duck and walks like a duck, it's a duck.

641
01:38:02,830 --> 01:38:04,832
[SPEAKER_20]: You could follow the votes as we move forward.

642
01:38:05,212 --> 01:38:11,758
[SPEAKER_20]: And it seems like it's ego driven and made to keep one group in place.

643
01:38:14,312 --> 01:38:37,399
[SPEAKER_20]: because when you're flopping on what you promised and then you come back and belittle people in the sense that not understanding, using excuses or words, that that's what divides the community, not listening to the people that were put instead of this group and have worked so hard to do that, have listened to the professionals that sat with our leadership and our volunteers.

644
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:39,420
[SPEAKER_20]: So

645
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:42,701
[SPEAKER_20]: It is what it is.

646
01:38:43,521 --> 01:38:47,224
[SPEAKER_20]: People aren't listening that are voting, that vote that represent you.

647
01:38:47,905 --> 01:38:48,906
[SPEAKER_20]: They're just not listening.

648
01:38:51,208 --> 01:38:54,290
[SPEAKER_20]: So I would stand against what my colleagues say.

649
01:38:54,370 --> 01:39:08,622
[SPEAKER_20]: You can have as many years of education on this topic as you want, but the bottom common sense failing of community and disengagement is evident with this vote and this, what we're hearing so far with all these changes that we've seen.

650
01:39:11,465 --> 01:39:14,068
[SPEAKER_20]: So listen, there's one counselor that Ms.

651
01:39:14,088 --> 01:39:26,120
[SPEAKER_20]: McDonald, I've spoken to you directly and I can honestly look you in the eye and apologize because I let my ego get in the way when I was against charter review for the fact of the ward representation.

652
01:39:26,941 --> 01:39:32,988
[SPEAKER_20]: But for one counselor, I sat back and you realize when you talk to different groups and different people and

653
01:39:34,091 --> 01:39:45,616
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, notwithstanding the respect the council that's of color on this council, but I've spoken to many people of color in our community that feel that they don't have a platform to run.

654
01:39:45,976 --> 01:39:51,779
[SPEAKER_20]: And the way, and the ward representation is the avenue to run on the council side.

655
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:58,582
[SPEAKER_20]: I think the format that was in place for the school committee as a former school member, like Mr. Gervino said,

656
01:40:01,493 --> 01:40:03,974
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that's moving in the right direction.

657
01:40:04,874 --> 01:40:07,715
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that really opens up and entices people to run.

658
01:40:07,735 --> 01:40:11,016
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's why it's important not to have all that lodge.

659
01:40:11,756 --> 01:40:12,856
[SPEAKER_20]: So I see the benefit.

660
01:40:13,837 --> 01:40:27,621
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, if I can implore anything to my colleagues and the voters is that very simple, please listen to all residents, listen to everybody, have an open mind.

661
01:40:29,843 --> 01:40:32,324
[SPEAKER_20]: because it's clear that that's not what we're getting.

662
01:40:33,284 --> 01:40:35,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

663
01:40:36,105 --> 01:40:36,905
[SPEAKER_06]: President Behrs.

664
01:40:38,046 --> 01:40:39,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Chair Seng.

665
01:40:39,967 --> 01:40:43,728
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have an open mind.

666
01:40:45,909 --> 01:40:50,470
[SPEAKER_06]: We change things all the time in this body based on the things that we discuss and the things that we talk about.

667
01:40:51,431 --> 01:40:55,052
[SPEAKER_06]: The proposal that I came forward with was amended on this floor.

668
01:40:59,813 --> 01:41:06,114
[SPEAKER_06]: when we talk about listening to the whole community, we can listen to the whole community.

669
01:41:06,375 --> 01:41:17,997
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't mean to spot member Vander Kloot here, but you had a great line when we were in a very, very tense time in the city and you had many, many intense meetings about a name change for a school.

670
01:41:18,017 --> 01:41:24,999
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm probably going to botch the specific line, but I think the gist of it was we are listening.

671
01:41:25,299 --> 01:41:26,159
[SPEAKER_06]: We just don't agree.

672
01:41:26,179 --> 01:41:28,440
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the gist of it.

673
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:29,060
[SPEAKER_06]: You said it better.

674
01:41:30,869 --> 01:41:31,949
[SPEAKER_06]: We had that conversation.

675
01:41:32,950 --> 01:41:47,321
[SPEAKER_06]: If we were to listen to everybody in this community, 100%, every single member, every single person would require me and George and Milva to agree 100% on everything and create a document that we all perfectly agree on.

676
01:41:47,621 --> 01:41:48,262
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't agree.

677
01:41:49,002 --> 01:41:49,843
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can't do that.

678
01:41:51,484 --> 01:41:53,585
[SPEAKER_06]: The voters put us here.

679
01:41:53,786 --> 01:41:56,328
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the city council that has to review this charter.

680
01:41:56,848 --> 01:41:58,029
[SPEAKER_06]: We have been put here to do

681
01:41:58,942 --> 01:42:00,983
[SPEAKER_06]: our duty to the best of our ability.

682
01:42:01,644 --> 01:42:03,184
[SPEAKER_06]: And I fundamentally believe that's what we're doing.

683
01:42:03,224 --> 01:42:05,246
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that's what you're doing, Councilor Scarpelli.

684
01:42:06,166 --> 01:42:11,669
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe you're representing what you believe to be the best approach, the best path forward.

685
01:42:12,350 --> 01:42:14,331
[SPEAKER_06]: I also believe that of myself and Councilor Lozaro.

686
01:42:14,411 --> 01:42:15,631
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe it of Chair McDonald.

687
01:42:15,671 --> 01:42:16,832
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe it of Mr. Chivino.

688
01:42:16,872 --> 01:42:18,153
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe it of everybody in this room.

689
01:42:20,114 --> 01:42:23,736
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe that compelling arguments can be made to change people's minds.

690
01:42:24,917 --> 01:42:26,758
[SPEAKER_06]: I, for example, haven't heard any councilor

691
01:42:27,947 --> 01:42:34,350
[SPEAKER_06]: say that because member Graham and member Rousseau said it, we should have all at large or that the mayor shouldn't be on the committee at all.

692
01:42:34,970 --> 01:42:36,151
[SPEAKER_06]: And those changes weren't proposed.

693
01:42:36,471 --> 01:42:40,973
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we, when we put this stuff forward, I mean, it's just an honest disagreement.

694
01:42:41,973 --> 01:42:43,974
[SPEAKER_06]: And I, you know, I asked the voters to listen as well.

695
01:42:45,515 --> 01:42:52,118
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want, if you are a single issue voter on the charter and you want a different outcome on the charter than what's good, what may or may not come out of this committee,

696
01:42:53,044 --> 01:42:59,271
[SPEAKER_06]: then you should ask the people who you want to elect what their opinion exactly is to the letter and have them follow it.

697
01:43:00,913 --> 01:43:12,367
[SPEAKER_06]: As someone who wrote the platform that's now been brought up twice around this question, it didn't say there shall be eight ward representatives and three at-large representatives and that is the only system by which we will follow.

698
01:43:13,871 --> 01:43:22,097
[SPEAKER_06]: If you read the full paragraph in the context of the Men for People's platform from 2023, it talks about representation and it has a context of having more local representation.

699
01:43:22,737 --> 01:43:30,903
[SPEAKER_06]: And there were honest disagreements in the people who drafted that platform, honest disagreements in the interpretation of the people who are seeing it now about what it meant.

700
01:43:32,444 --> 01:43:34,566
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, whatever, throw it in our face.

701
01:43:34,586 --> 01:43:36,167
[SPEAKER_06]: I should have seen that.

702
01:43:36,707 --> 01:43:39,609
[SPEAKER_06]: And I should have added a little more nuance to something that's highly nuanced.

703
01:43:40,150 --> 01:43:41,831
[SPEAKER_06]: My bad, use it against me.

704
01:43:42,531 --> 01:43:42,992
[SPEAKER_06]: It's okay.

705
01:43:43,988 --> 01:43:54,191
[SPEAKER_06]: As I've done here for the past five years and hope to continue to do as long as the voters will have me, I'm gonna do what I think is right and what I think gets us the best outcome.

706
01:43:55,332 --> 01:43:59,473
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can keep throwing stuff around to the other effect.

707
01:43:59,553 --> 01:44:00,594
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not gonna get us anywhere.

708
01:44:00,654 --> 01:44:00,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

709
01:44:02,614 --> 01:44:02,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

710
01:44:03,054 --> 01:44:06,636
[SPEAKER_09]: I see Councillor Holland said, do you still wanna speak?

711
01:44:09,577 --> 01:44:10,217
[SPEAKER_31]: I'll hold for now.

712
01:44:10,257 --> 01:44:10,517
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

713
01:44:12,674 --> 01:44:13,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

714
01:44:13,034 --> 01:44:24,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, are there any other comments from counselors, we, we don't have any motions on the floor, I see two hands raised, but I will.

715
01:44:25,707 --> 01:44:28,369
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to give counselors a chance to speak.

716
01:44:29,582 --> 01:44:36,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, I'll take these two comments, and then if there are no motions, we should move on to the next section.

717
01:44:37,805 --> 01:44:40,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Gaston Fiore, I'm gonna ask you to unmute.

718
01:44:41,026 --> 01:44:43,728
[SPEAKER_09]: When you unmute, can you give us your name and address for the record, please?

719
01:44:44,728 --> 01:44:45,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

720
01:44:50,370 --> 01:44:51,711
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, Chair Seng.

721
01:44:51,731 --> 01:44:53,831
[SPEAKER_32]: Gaston Fiore, 61 Stigney Road.

722
01:44:55,332 --> 01:44:57,553
[SPEAKER_32]: I think in considering the structure of government,

723
01:44:58,273 --> 01:45:00,755
[SPEAKER_32]: we should take into account the complexity.

724
01:45:01,635 --> 01:45:17,387
[SPEAKER_32]: And given the complexity that we are talking about, I don't think voters are gonna have any problem at the time that they're voting in choosing either a city councilor or a school committee member, or for that matter in understanding their structure of the local government.

725
01:45:18,408 --> 01:45:25,313
[SPEAKER_32]: I think what we should focus on is possibly an increasing representation or some other means of

726
01:45:26,332 --> 01:45:29,835
[SPEAKER_32]: increasing participation of residents in the voting process.

727
01:45:29,935 --> 01:45:40,904
[SPEAKER_32]: Because I would like to remind everyone that the participation rate in local elections covers around 30%, which is pretty low, at least for my standards.

728
01:45:41,725 --> 01:45:46,809
[SPEAKER_32]: And we haven't seen it increase in the last few local elections.

729
01:45:47,890 --> 01:45:55,496
[SPEAKER_32]: So we can discuss structured government and what would be the best system to have, which is

730
01:45:56,093 --> 01:46:15,284
[SPEAKER_32]: a really important discussion to have, but at the same time, I think we should be discussing what could be done to increase engagement of residents in their government and to bring that participation rate in the local elections a lot higher than what it has been for the past few years.

731
01:46:16,005 --> 01:46:16,645
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you very much.

732
01:46:18,466 --> 01:46:18,867
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

733
01:46:19,947 --> 01:46:20,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Zachary Chertok.

734
01:46:24,053 --> 01:46:28,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me ask you to unmute once you're on mute, name and address for the record, please.

735
01:46:34,038 --> 01:46:35,838
[SPEAKER_12]: Zachary Chartalk, 5 Allmont Street.

736
01:46:37,399 --> 01:46:48,045
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just do want to call, and I apologize for being a little bit late to this process, but in assessing past experiences where particularly interstitial cities with a changing

737
01:46:49,165 --> 01:46:52,948
[SPEAKER_12]: Demographics, such as ours, and as part of a greater metropolitan area.

738
01:46:52,968 --> 01:46:58,793
[SPEAKER_12]: Have attempted to, or undergone changes from more representation to districts.

739
01:46:59,373 --> 01:47:03,196
[SPEAKER_12]: There have been studies done by the, and from as long ago as 2008 up until most recently 2023.

740
01:47:10,242 --> 01:47:25,832
[SPEAKER_12]: that all show that inner district representation suffers under a districting model where multiple demographies are grouped together in districts and consequently they often tend to favor the more wealthy interests within the district itself.

741
01:47:26,392 --> 01:47:46,254
[SPEAKER_12]: that often leads minorities and particularly when we're talking about schools and resourcing, you know, on the public resourcing side, senior citizen residents on the school side, those with disabilities or in need of special needs, often fall lower in budgeting priorities over the interests of the wealthier majority that's trying to push for

742
01:47:47,074 --> 01:47:49,615
[SPEAKER_12]: a higher achieving academic curriculum.

743
01:47:50,255 --> 01:48:01,259
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would highly encourage that if they have not already, that the city council move to look at a deeper review of historical and current studies on this issue.

744
01:48:02,359 --> 01:48:06,980
[SPEAKER_12]: In addition to the two-year process that they've done working on the design of the policy.

745
01:48:07,481 --> 01:48:10,862
[SPEAKER_12]: From what I've read so far, some of that abstract and background is missing.

746
01:48:11,242 --> 01:48:11,522
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

747
01:48:13,042 --> 01:48:13,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

748
01:48:14,423 --> 01:48:20,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Marie Izzo, I'm gonna ask you to unmute, name and address for the record, please, once you unmute.

749
01:48:29,163 --> 01:48:30,944
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, sorry, took me a minute there.

750
01:48:32,805 --> 01:48:49,792
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to thank all of you, the work of the Charter Review Group, the Council, everyone involved in this process, because I feel like this Council is really engaging the community as a whole, just by reviewing everything that has been tabled for years.

751
01:48:50,973 --> 01:48:54,278
[SPEAKER_11]: It's created a lot of controversy, but this is a healthy process.

752
01:48:55,059 --> 01:49:02,190
[SPEAKER_11]: I've sat through many meetings in the past that were completely unattended with nothing happening and very little public participation.

753
01:49:03,572 --> 01:49:05,334
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm thrilled that we can have

754
01:49:06,069 --> 01:49:08,753
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, healthy discourse we don't have to agree.

755
01:49:08,773 --> 01:49:16,584
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to mention that I'm in favor of ward representation, and I'm happy with the numbers chosen by this council in good faith.

756
01:49:16,705 --> 01:49:20,490
[SPEAKER_11]: I also want to say that for the majority of the counselors.

757
01:49:21,451 --> 01:49:37,546
[SPEAKER_11]: In watching, you know, the day-to-day campaign that went on for years, you know, and all the door knocking that occurred and getting, you know, an idea of what people want for this city, you know, I think it's really not fair to say

758
01:49:38,462 --> 01:49:42,245
[SPEAKER_11]: that this community is standing behind this process.

759
01:49:44,787 --> 01:49:46,709
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's really all I have to say.

760
01:49:46,809 --> 01:49:50,412
[SPEAKER_11]: And just allowing people to speak up, say what they have to say.

761
01:49:51,633 --> 01:49:55,517
[SPEAKER_11]: But yet I'm very confident that at every stop,

762
01:49:56,544 --> 01:49:57,825
[SPEAKER_11]: all the way door to door.

763
01:49:58,265 --> 01:50:00,807
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been here 30 something years.

764
01:50:00,868 --> 01:50:02,389
[SPEAKER_11]: My family's been here 50 years.

765
01:50:02,909 --> 01:50:05,431
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never had anyone knock on my door.

766
01:50:06,252 --> 01:50:12,076
[SPEAKER_11]: From the past, counselors that have been here for many, many years, I have no problems calling them.

767
01:50:12,136 --> 01:50:15,339
[SPEAKER_11]: If people agree with me and I call, they might call me back.

768
01:50:15,399 --> 01:50:19,883
[SPEAKER_11]: If they disagree with me, and I'm talking about in the past, then they wouldn't call me back.

769
01:50:20,423 --> 01:50:22,385
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just really need to say this.

770
01:50:23,445 --> 01:50:24,005
[SPEAKER_11]: out loud.

771
01:50:24,266 --> 01:50:26,527
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm thrilled that we're going to change this charter.

772
01:50:26,847 --> 01:50:28,808
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, it's a hard process.

773
01:50:28,868 --> 01:50:29,728
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not perfect.

774
01:50:30,388 --> 01:50:36,211
[SPEAKER_11]: But thanks again for allowing us to speak up and be part of history in Medford.

775
01:50:36,391 --> 01:50:36,811
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

776
01:50:38,392 --> 01:50:39,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Marie.

777
01:50:42,235 --> 01:50:50,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing no other hands from Councillors or on Zoom from members of the public, there are no motions on the floor.

778
01:50:50,557 --> 01:51:08,143
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is, I want to remind the public, the City Council as a whole has not made a final decision on the type of, the composition of the representation yet, and that we will be picking this up at the next committee, the whole meeting on this topic.

779
01:51:09,923 --> 01:51:14,365
[SPEAKER_09]: I do have one more comment that I neglected to read.

780
01:51:15,225 --> 01:51:16,986
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I think we can move on.

781
01:51:17,166 --> 01:51:18,767
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems like we can move on to the next section.

782
01:51:19,407 --> 01:51:24,489
[SPEAKER_09]: But this is part of Vice Chair Graham's comments on section 4.1.

783
01:51:27,330 --> 01:51:33,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Two-year terms are simply too short to cultivate the depth of experience and long-term vision necessary for effective governance and education.

784
01:51:33,757 --> 01:51:40,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Short terms without the stability of longer terms make it difficult to implement meaningful change and introduce constant disruptions.

785
01:51:40,664 --> 01:51:50,354
[SPEAKER_09]: If a district ward and at-large structure remains, perhaps the council should consider extending at-large terms to four years and align with the mayor's term and re-election pathway.

786
01:51:50,794 --> 01:52:04,221
[SPEAKER_09]: This could help foster stability, ensuring that school community members can focus on long-term educational goals, as importantly, with such short terms, a recall provision would be counterproductive, potentially politicizing our work.

787
01:52:05,161 --> 01:52:13,005
[SPEAKER_09]: That being said, I just wanted to make sure I didn't miss anything from comments that were sent in from elected officials.

788
01:52:14,386 --> 01:52:18,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have any other comments on Section 4-1 before we move on to Section 4-2?

789
01:52:22,523 --> 01:52:29,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, section 4-2, school committee organization, chair, vice chair, and clerk, secretary.

790
01:52:31,153 --> 01:52:39,904
[SPEAKER_09]: I have some comments from school committee members, but are there any comments from city council members before I get to those?

791
01:52:42,197 --> 01:52:45,678
[SPEAKER_09]: seeing none in person, seeing none on Zoom.

792
01:52:46,899 --> 01:52:51,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me read what Vice Chair Graham has sent.

793
01:52:51,621 --> 01:53:01,645
[SPEAKER_09]: She said, the current language in section 4-2, which seeks to dictate the structure of how our body operates and elects its leaders is another significant concern.

794
01:53:02,125 --> 01:53:06,307
[SPEAKER_09]: The school committee should have the autonomy to choose how its members are elected.

795
01:53:06,887 --> 01:53:15,192
[SPEAKER_09]: By dictating the manner of internal elections, the charter would intrude upon the committee's ability to organize itself to best meet the needs of Medford's children.

796
01:53:15,752 --> 01:53:25,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Our responsibility is to put students first and to do that, the school committee needs the flexibility to make decisions about our governance that will allow us to serve students best.

797
01:53:26,659 --> 01:53:32,463
[SPEAKER_09]: From member Rousseau, we have a few comments.

798
01:53:33,638 --> 01:53:36,719
[SPEAKER_09]: They're accompanied by some recommendations.

799
01:53:36,799 --> 01:53:37,959
[SPEAKER_09]: The first one is clerical.

800
01:53:38,980 --> 01:53:48,642
[SPEAKER_09]: He suggests a change to replace clerk parentheses secretary with secretary parentheses clerk to ensure consistency with the rest of the document.

801
01:53:50,222 --> 01:53:51,903
[SPEAKER_09]: The next comment is

802
01:53:52,923 --> 01:54:09,462
[SPEAKER_09]: to is on section subsection a of this of the draft charter and he suggests to add the word chair to the list of positions to be selected by school committee members.

803
01:54:10,565 --> 01:54:17,792
[SPEAKER_09]: His rationale is that the chair should be elected by the body as the chair is, by definition, the servant of the body.

804
01:54:18,232 --> 01:54:23,597
[SPEAKER_09]: This is another reason why the chair should not be the mayor if the mayor is not deemed a suitable chair or is not serving the body.

805
01:54:23,657 --> 01:54:26,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Effectively, there would be no recourse to select a different chair.

806
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:31,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Electing the chair ensures accountability and responsiveness to the needs of the community.

807
01:54:31,945 --> 01:54:41,388
[SPEAKER_09]: He also suggests striking the phrase, who will serve for one year, which is at the very end of that subsection.

808
01:54:41,548 --> 01:54:50,411
[SPEAKER_09]: He says, the school committee should have the autonomy to determine the duration of service for its leadership positions rather than having it dictated by the charter.

809
01:54:50,732 --> 01:54:54,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Notably, the charter does not impose similar structural controls on the city council.

810
01:54:54,833 --> 01:55:00,355
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems inconsistent that one elected body is allowed to decide its organizational structure while another is not.

811
01:55:01,777 --> 01:55:03,300
[SPEAKER_09]: from member Intapa.

812
01:55:03,320 --> 01:55:08,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I missed a few comments there.

813
01:55:11,078 --> 01:55:23,665
[SPEAKER_09]: When it comes to subsection B, member Russo, he is suggesting that we strike the words with the assistant of the superintendent of schools and replace it with the chair.

814
01:55:24,806 --> 01:55:29,669
[SPEAKER_09]: He said, basic to Robert's rules of order, the chair is responsible for setting the agenda.

815
01:55:30,049 --> 01:55:34,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Although the body can override it since the agenda ultimately belongs to the body.

816
01:55:35,092 --> 01:55:38,774
[SPEAKER_09]: The superintendent works for the committee and it is the school committee that sets the agenda.

817
01:55:39,780 --> 01:55:44,244
[SPEAKER_09]: He also suggests striking and to decide all questions of order.

818
01:55:44,784 --> 01:55:56,013
[SPEAKER_09]: In the same subsection, he said, Robert's rules of order makes clear that while the chair does decide all questions of order, the body may override the chair by questioning the ruling of the chair.

819
01:55:56,253 --> 01:56:03,980
[SPEAKER_09]: This language implies that the rulings of the questions of order belong only to the chair and removes the premise that the chair is a servant of the body.

820
01:56:04,660 --> 01:56:21,084
[SPEAKER_09]: He suggests also striking the sentence, the chair shall appoint members to various subcommittees after seeking each member's views regarding interest and availability, said subcommittee appointments are the responsibility of the entire school committee, not just one individual.

821
01:56:21,684 --> 01:56:25,205
[SPEAKER_09]: The chair is meant to serve the body, not to dictate its organization.

822
01:56:25,945 --> 01:56:32,347
[SPEAKER_09]: And with regards to subsection C, I believe, or this is also subsection B,

823
01:56:35,582 --> 01:56:47,710
[SPEAKER_09]: He's suggesting to strike the section that says provided, however, that a city of provided, however, that a city officer or other city employee who has vacated a position in order to

824
01:56:51,750 --> 01:57:07,301
[SPEAKER_09]: In order to return to the same office or position of city employment held at the same time, the position was vacated if it has remained vacant, but shall not be eligible for any other municipal position until at least one year after the end of service as a member of the school committee.

825
01:57:08,581 --> 01:57:16,947
[SPEAKER_09]: And he says that this restriction has not been applied to the city council, indicating an inconsistency in how the charter governs different elected bodies.

826
01:57:22,510 --> 01:57:29,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I think that was under 4-3, prohibitions, but it was labeled to be under 4-2.

827
01:57:29,973 --> 01:57:30,913
[SPEAKER_09]: So apologies for that.

828
01:57:35,025 --> 01:57:40,488
[SPEAKER_09]: that section 4-2 seems like basic Roberts rules of order, and I see no needed adjustments.

829
01:57:41,609 --> 01:57:43,190
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all the written comments I have.

830
01:57:43,390 --> 01:57:49,854
[SPEAKER_09]: If there are other comments from sitting school committee members, please raise your hand on Zoom or come up to the podium.

831
01:57:52,936 --> 01:57:55,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, recognizing Councilor Zara.

832
01:57:56,618 --> 01:57:58,859
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm sorry.

833
01:57:58,879 --> 01:58:03,322
[SPEAKER_26]: I would like to motion to make a couple of the changes

834
01:58:04,777 --> 01:58:07,760
[SPEAKER_26]: clerical changes recommended by members.

835
01:58:07,780 --> 01:58:21,955
[SPEAKER_26]: So the first, and I can email this, is a motion to change the title of section 4-2 to read section 4-2 school committee organization chair, vice chair, and secretary parentheses clerk.

836
01:58:24,663 --> 01:58:37,191
[SPEAKER_26]: And the second one is to strike the final words in section A. So have it be a period after clerks, so it wouldn't say who will each serve for one year.

837
01:58:38,151 --> 01:58:47,077
[SPEAKER_26]: Just for consistency with the section that covers city council, it doesn't dictate how long they serve for.

838
01:58:48,377 --> 01:58:49,198
[SPEAKER_26]: So I can...

839
01:58:50,667 --> 01:58:51,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

840
01:58:51,627 --> 01:58:52,928
[SPEAKER_09]: The clerk's email is down right now.

841
01:58:53,108 --> 01:58:55,848
[SPEAKER_09]: If you could email that to me and I'll show it to the clerk.

842
01:58:57,729 --> 01:59:03,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, we have a motion from Chair, or Councilor Lazaro on a few edits.

843
01:59:04,090 --> 01:59:06,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have any other comments from Councilors?

844
01:59:10,191 --> 01:59:11,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Just speaking from the chair, yes, yeah.

845
01:59:13,988 --> 01:59:16,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Council President Behrs.

846
01:59:16,849 --> 01:59:30,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Just the third recommendation under comment 13 by Member Russo, the appointment of subcommittees and move to adopt that language or to strike that language as well.

847
01:59:32,351 --> 01:59:39,936
[SPEAKER_09]: We have another motion from President Behrs on striking the language.

848
01:59:40,317 --> 01:59:44,280
[SPEAKER_09]: It's noted in the third comment under comment 13.

849
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:55,628
[SPEAKER_09]: Just speaking from the chair, I do worry that deciding all questions of order that that phrase might create some legal difficulties if we keep it in.

850
01:59:56,768 --> 01:59:59,270
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems to refer to Robert's Rules of Order, but I think

851
02:00:02,032 --> 02:00:13,095
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that if we don't strike it, our legislative intent seems to be that we want the chair of the school committee to decide all questions of order.

852
02:00:13,495 --> 02:00:17,516
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that's an important clerical change to make, but I can't make motions from the chair.

853
02:00:18,216 --> 02:00:23,877
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's a similar situation with the first recommendation in that comment, where

854
02:00:27,360 --> 02:00:37,247
[SPEAKER_09]: In my reading of the charter, I worry that that constrains the ability of the chair to prepare the agenda, but I am the chair, so I can't make motions.

855
02:00:41,749 --> 02:00:42,210
[SPEAKER_09]: President Berry.

856
02:00:42,790 --> 02:00:46,633
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll amend my motion to just adopt the changes proposed by Member Russo and comment 13.

857
02:00:47,982 --> 02:00:48,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

858
02:00:49,643 --> 02:00:53,705
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have two motions, one from Councilor Zara, one from President Behrs.

859
02:00:54,105 --> 02:00:57,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any other comments from Councilors before we move to public participation?

860
02:01:01,288 --> 02:01:04,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, do we have any comments from members of the public on 4-2?

861
02:01:05,930 --> 02:01:11,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sorry, we have one comment with Councilor Collins.

862
02:01:15,758 --> 02:01:22,042
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you chair saying I just wanted to note that pending the vote to remove the.

863
02:01:23,343 --> 02:01:36,732
[SPEAKER_31]: Mayor as by necessity, the chair of the school committee, we might also want to and i'm happy to make this in a for promotion, we might also want to accept the suggested change to add chair to the list of positions to be selected by the school committee members, as that would then have to be the case.

864
02:01:40,311 --> 02:01:42,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

865
02:01:42,233 --> 02:01:45,775
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that that seems to be a clerical thing too.

866
02:01:46,456 --> 02:01:50,319
[SPEAKER_09]: I know member van der Kloet, former member van der Kloet wanted to make public comments.

867
02:01:50,479 --> 02:01:55,243
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have more comments to make, please feel free to get in line or raise your hand on too.

868
02:01:56,231 --> 02:02:03,312
[SPEAKER_27]: So I wanted to address this issue of the autonomy of the school committee to pick their own officers or how that's done.

869
02:02:03,912 --> 02:02:07,993
[SPEAKER_27]: And I will tell you that this comes from my long years of experience.

870
02:02:08,833 --> 02:02:14,054
[SPEAKER_27]: And one of the things that I understand is that power is just so sweet.

871
02:02:15,275 --> 02:02:20,335
[SPEAKER_27]: And if you would, I have seen that selection process happen.

872
02:02:20,916 --> 02:02:22,596
[SPEAKER_27]: And I have seen very, very good people

873
02:02:23,491 --> 02:02:31,036
[SPEAKER_27]: who then decided they wanted to keep on being and locking out other members from getting an opportunity.

874
02:02:31,716 --> 02:02:46,365
[SPEAKER_27]: I think it's important that members of the body have an opportunity to be either, which now would be the chair and secretary.

875
02:02:48,087 --> 02:02:53,108
[SPEAKER_27]: So if you would, that part of this comes from trying not to prevent fiefdoms.

876
02:02:53,428 --> 02:03:01,750
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, in the original charter, when I went to look at it, there was practically nothing about the school committee.

877
02:03:02,510 --> 02:03:11,372
[SPEAKER_27]: And in this charter, there's not as much as I would like, quite honestly, because at the recommendation of the Collins Center, quite a bit was taken out that we had talked about.

878
02:03:14,513 --> 02:03:22,255
[SPEAKER_27]: While I certainly understand the argument of having the body be autonomous and make their own decisions, I've also seen the negative.

879
02:03:23,015 --> 02:03:25,776
[SPEAKER_27]: And we have to look at both positions.

880
02:03:26,356 --> 02:03:29,296
[SPEAKER_27]: Now we're talking about chair and secretary.

881
02:03:30,157 --> 02:03:36,318
[SPEAKER_27]: Now the secretary role includes signing the bills on behalf of the school committee.

882
02:03:37,018 --> 02:03:43,600
[SPEAKER_27]: That is the current structure that we use in Medford is the secretary of the school committee signs the bills.

883
02:03:44,600 --> 02:03:50,642
[SPEAKER_27]: And once upon a time, I signed the bills for 10 years in a row.

884
02:03:52,103 --> 02:04:01,487
[SPEAKER_27]: It is a damn good thing that I'm honest, because nobody should have ever possibly wanted me to sign the bills for 10 years in a row.

885
02:04:02,187 --> 02:04:09,850
[SPEAKER_27]: And of course, I definitely invited my colleagues in and said, please take a look at what I'm doing, because I want to make sure that somebody else has eyes on this besides me.

886
02:04:12,110 --> 02:04:18,372
[SPEAKER_27]: It is not always a popular position because it takes time, but there is also an added stipend.

887
02:04:19,593 --> 02:04:27,576
[SPEAKER_27]: And there are added stipends for the position of what used to be vice chair and secretary.

888
02:04:28,036 --> 02:04:33,578
[SPEAKER_27]: And in fact, I saw the recommendations that I think Councilor Behrs put out.

889
02:04:34,118 --> 02:04:35,378
[SPEAKER_27]: It's significant money.

890
02:04:35,939 --> 02:04:39,540
[SPEAKER_27]: I think it was like an $8,000 stipend for these positions.

891
02:04:42,728 --> 02:04:55,746
[SPEAKER_27]: I am wanting members to have the opportunity to do these different roles and not just keep it so that one person develops power and fiefdom.

892
02:04:55,846 --> 02:04:59,651
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, if you read it, a key word is consecutive.

893
02:05:00,532 --> 02:05:05,315
[SPEAKER_27]: I didn't say you can only do it once when we wrote this language and you don't get to do it again.

894
02:05:05,855 --> 02:05:08,437
[SPEAKER_27]: I just said you can't do it consecutively.

895
02:05:08,897 --> 02:05:13,760
[SPEAKER_27]: So you can do it in, you could be the chair in year one, year three, year five.

896
02:05:14,100 --> 02:05:15,902
[SPEAKER_27]: You could be the secretary then.

897
02:05:16,442 --> 02:05:18,143
[SPEAKER_27]: You could alternate those two.

898
02:05:18,303 --> 02:05:24,147
[SPEAKER_27]: So it's far from perfect, but I think it's better than not saying anything at all.

899
02:05:25,007 --> 02:05:26,870
[SPEAKER_27]: So that is the thinking behind it.

900
02:05:26,970 --> 02:05:35,461
[SPEAKER_27]: That is the rationale as we spoke on the committee of saying, look, do we put this in now personally, and maybe it's my mistake because I didn't catch it.

901
02:05:36,362 --> 02:05:40,768
[SPEAKER_27]: But I didn't think about it, I have experience as a school committee member, not as a city counselor.

902
02:05:41,228 --> 02:05:44,292
[SPEAKER_27]: Because quite honestly, I think you guys ought to rotate your chair, too.

903
02:05:44,972 --> 02:05:48,116
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't like the idea of having one person be the chair every single year.

904
02:05:48,496 --> 02:05:51,520
[SPEAKER_27]: I'd much rather see it rotate around members.

905
02:05:52,080 --> 02:05:57,667
[SPEAKER_27]: And that isn't to say that I don't want to see Council Behrs not be the chair.

906
02:05:59,208 --> 02:05:59,609
[SPEAKER_27]: at all.

907
02:05:59,929 --> 02:06:02,511
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm happy if he's chair one, three and five or whatever.

908
02:06:03,071 --> 02:06:03,772
[SPEAKER_27]: You get my point.

909
02:06:04,192 --> 02:06:10,257
[SPEAKER_27]: I just don't think that one person in our city government should have a lock on these positions.

910
02:06:10,458 --> 02:06:19,225
[SPEAKER_27]: I think it's important to let other members have a chance to get the experience of leading and being in that role.

911
02:06:19,785 --> 02:06:20,606
[SPEAKER_27]: That's where it comes from.

912
02:06:22,617 --> 02:06:27,603
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to note, I don't, I might be reading this wrong.

913
02:06:27,643 --> 02:06:32,489
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see the word consecutive in this draft of the city charter.

914
02:06:32,509 --> 02:06:35,953
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just wanted to, it just says one year.

915
02:06:41,607 --> 02:06:45,130
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, I need to take a look because it was originally that's what our discussion was.

916
02:06:45,370 --> 02:06:46,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, okay, yeah.

917
02:06:47,091 --> 02:06:53,677
[SPEAKER_27]: The intent of being is that it would just, you know, because every two years you've got different people on the committee anyway.

918
02:06:55,038 --> 02:07:01,503
[SPEAKER_27]: So there's change, you know, so, but the idea was that not one person wouldn't have a lock on it.

919
02:07:02,323 --> 02:07:03,004
[SPEAKER_27]: So I'll take a look.

920
02:07:04,185 --> 02:07:07,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anything, I just have one more question for you.

921
02:07:09,560 --> 02:07:33,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there, I think some of what's being said generally is that, and we had a long conversation about this on the city council side, is that, is this worry that if you build stringent rules into the charter, that sometimes there are things that the school committee or city council need to adapt for rules-wise, and that it won't give them that flexibility in the rule structure?

922
02:07:33,927 --> 02:07:35,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anything you'd like to say to that?

923
02:07:38,871 --> 02:07:40,572
[SPEAKER_27]: Well then don't put anything in the jar.

924
02:07:40,672 --> 02:07:43,273
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, you know, that's always a possibility.

925
02:07:44,094 --> 02:07:48,837
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, you know, the, I don't, I don't know.

926
02:07:50,305 --> 02:07:51,465
[SPEAKER_27]: how else to go about it.

927
02:07:52,426 --> 02:07:59,668
[SPEAKER_27]: I understand people don't necessarily agree with me, but some of those people may be the same people who have a lock on positions now.

928
02:08:00,228 --> 02:08:01,309
[SPEAKER_27]: And I don't know if that's true or not.

929
02:08:01,349 --> 02:08:03,069
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't want that.

930
02:08:03,150 --> 02:08:09,512
[SPEAKER_27]: But I'm just saying that for me, I am looking at not creating fiefdoms of power.

931
02:08:09,892 --> 02:08:14,153
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm looking at ways of giving other members opportunities.

932
02:08:14,654 --> 02:08:15,354
[SPEAKER_27]: It's pretty simple.

933
02:08:16,014 --> 02:08:17,134
[SPEAKER_27]: To me, it's common sense.

934
02:08:17,875 --> 02:08:18,195
[SPEAKER_09]: I see.

935
02:08:18,295 --> 02:08:18,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

936
02:08:20,204 --> 02:08:28,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any other comments from members of the public or members of the city council on the proposed motions or on the section more generally?

937
02:08:31,333 --> 02:08:36,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, we do have two motions on the floor, one from Councilor Zaro.

938
02:08:37,838 --> 02:08:43,743
[SPEAKER_09]: And if just because of the email situation, if you could reread the motion for us, that'd be very helpful.

939
02:08:44,864 --> 02:08:49,167
[SPEAKER_09]: And after Councilor Zaro reads it, if we have a second for it, that'd be good to hear.

940
02:08:54,052 --> 02:08:55,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sorry.

941
02:08:56,293 --> 02:08:57,554
[SPEAKER_26]: That's okay.

942
02:08:58,114 --> 02:08:59,114
[SPEAKER_26]: It's two items.

943
02:08:59,154 --> 02:09:10,239
[SPEAKER_26]: I can put them into one motion, but it's motion to change the title of section 4-2 to read, section 4-2, school committee organization, chair, vice chair, and secretary, parentheses, clerk.

944
02:09:11,219 --> 02:09:19,303
[SPEAKER_26]: And then a motion to strike final words of section 4-2A in line 13, following vice chair and secretary, clerk.

945
02:09:21,005 --> 02:09:26,386
[SPEAKER_26]: So it would, I can read the whole thing, but it would be like, it just cuts who will each serve.

946
02:09:26,667 --> 02:09:28,367
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think you need to read the line.

947
02:09:28,607 --> 02:09:28,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

948
02:09:30,328 --> 02:09:33,248
[SPEAKER_09]: I've shown the clerk the language you just read.

949
02:09:33,428 --> 02:09:35,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have a second for Councilor Zara's motion?

950
02:09:37,930 --> 02:09:39,150
[SPEAKER_09]: Second from President Behrs.

951
02:09:39,870 --> 02:09:42,051
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll give the clerk a second to transfer.

952
02:10:02,950 --> 02:10:03,470
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

953
02:10:10,296 --> 02:10:11,517
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, when you're ready to pull roll, yes.

954
02:10:11,617 --> 02:10:11,997
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

955
02:10:14,719 --> 02:10:15,740
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Collins?

956
02:10:17,001 --> 02:10:17,221
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

957
02:10:19,303 --> 02:10:20,084
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Zaro?

958
02:10:20,444 --> 02:10:20,584
Yes.

959
02:10:21,845 --> 02:10:22,686
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Scarpelli?

960
02:10:22,986 --> 02:10:25,888
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

961
02:10:26,649 --> 02:10:27,270
[SPEAKER_21]: Chairman Seng?

962
02:10:27,570 --> 02:10:27,810
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

963
02:10:29,151 --> 02:10:29,752
[SPEAKER_09]: President Beers?

964
02:10:30,092 --> 02:10:30,192
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

965
02:10:31,030 --> 02:10:33,992
[SPEAKER_09]: We have four affirmative, one negative motion passes.

966
02:10:34,492 --> 02:10:37,874
[SPEAKER_09]: We have one more motion on the floor from President Behrs.

967
02:10:37,934 --> 02:10:41,116
[SPEAKER_09]: If you could also send that to me and then read it out.

968
02:10:41,516 --> 02:10:41,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

969
02:10:41,737 --> 02:10:42,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sorry.

970
02:10:48,613 --> 02:10:49,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Chair Sang.

971
02:10:50,714 --> 02:10:57,137
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to send any motions that I make tonight to you, to the assistant clerk, and to the clerk.

972
02:10:57,317 --> 02:10:58,677
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have it in some form.

973
02:10:59,178 --> 02:11:02,219
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll BCC myself, so I'll have a backup copy.

974
02:11:02,959 --> 02:11:07,481
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm moving to adopt the comments, suggested changes in comment 13 by member Russo.

975
02:11:08,542 --> 02:11:17,706
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's that the chair will produce the agenda, the questions of order line, and also

976
02:11:18,913 --> 02:11:21,174
[SPEAKER_06]: that the chair appoints the members to the subcommittees.

977
02:11:22,455 --> 02:11:22,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

978
02:11:23,055 --> 02:11:24,456
[SPEAKER_09]: So do we have a second for that motion?

979
02:11:25,996 --> 02:11:27,637
[SPEAKER_09]: Second by Councilor Zaro.

980
02:11:30,178 --> 02:11:30,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Whenever you're ready.

981
02:11:41,203 --> 02:11:42,164
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Collins?

982
02:11:42,824 --> 02:11:43,064
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

983
02:11:44,805 --> 02:11:45,505
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Zaro?

984
02:11:45,846 --> 02:11:46,026
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

985
02:11:47,426 --> 02:11:48,107
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Scapelli?

986
02:11:48,127 --> 02:11:48,167
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

987
02:11:50,865 --> 02:11:51,425
[SPEAKER_21]: Chairman Singh.

988
02:11:51,666 --> 02:11:51,866
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

989
02:11:52,827 --> 02:11:53,447
[SPEAKER_21]: President Pierce.

990
02:11:53,667 --> 02:11:53,947
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

991
02:11:54,528 --> 02:11:56,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Forward affirmative one negative motion passes.

992
02:11:58,631 --> 02:12:01,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on to section four dash three prohibitions.

993
02:12:01,493 --> 02:12:11,641
[SPEAKER_09]: They're the only comment I had received from a school committee members, unless any school committee members want to speak up tonight is that is the one that I read from.

994
02:12:12,835 --> 02:12:25,900
[SPEAKER_09]: member Rousseau that the restriction had the restriction in the second half of this section hasn't been applied to City Council and that his recommendation would be to strike it.

995
02:12:26,640 --> 02:12:30,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any comments from councillors or on section 4-3?

996
02:12:30,141 --> 02:12:34,103
[SPEAKER_09]: President Behrs?

997
02:12:34,723 --> 02:12:36,124
[SPEAKER_06]: I just more have a question.

998
02:12:38,628 --> 02:12:51,175
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe for the Collins Center, it does look like this is different from the prohibitions in the other sections, and that it allows someone to return to, let me see if I can get this exactly right.

999
02:12:56,958 --> 02:13:03,082
[SPEAKER_06]: If a city officer or other employee who has vacated a position in order to serve as a member may return to the same office or position of employment,

1000
02:13:03,870 --> 02:13:09,875
[SPEAKER_06]: held at the time of the position was vacated if it has remained vacant, but shall not be eligible for any other municipal position.

1001
02:13:09,895 --> 02:13:12,016
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just wondering what the use case was for that.

1002
02:13:12,196 --> 02:13:21,564
[SPEAKER_06]: If our call-in center representatives could, I'm guessing it's just standard language that got incorporated, but I'm wondering why it's there for the school committee and not for the council or for like the mayor.

1003
02:13:23,525 --> 02:13:31,872
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems to imply that there may be a position that someone might vacate to then serve on the school committee that they would then return to.

1004
02:13:31,912 --> 02:13:33,193
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just not sure what that is.

1005
02:13:34,903 --> 02:13:36,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you, sorry, could you just come to the podium?

1006
02:13:38,445 --> 02:13:39,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Four three, yeah.

1007
02:13:40,587 --> 02:13:42,168
[SPEAKER_15]: It doesn't usually show up for both.

1008
02:13:43,149 --> 02:13:44,189
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know why it's not here.

1009
02:13:44,830 --> 02:13:45,650
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not sure why it's there?

1010
02:13:45,670 --> 02:13:46,551
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I know.

1011
02:13:46,571 --> 02:13:50,954
[SPEAKER_15]: I know it's usually in for both counselors and school committee members.

1012
02:13:51,274 --> 02:13:53,095
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know why it wasn't put for counsel.

1013
02:13:54,096 --> 02:13:55,917
[SPEAKER_06]: What would the case be for that?

1014
02:13:55,957 --> 02:14:02,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it like if I just can't think of the case as someone holding open the football coach position or the

1015
02:14:03,922 --> 02:14:06,463
[SPEAKER_06]: the recreation director or the, you know, or.

1016
02:14:06,503 --> 02:14:09,505
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, no, I mean, it's pretty theoretical.

1017
02:14:09,605 --> 02:14:26,197
[SPEAKER_15]: So you're the recreation director and you run for council and you're elected and you decide that it's more important for you to serve as the council, as the counselor and not keep your job.

1018
02:14:27,658 --> 02:14:32,601
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, you're going to vacate your position, but if the position is still available,

1019
02:14:33,301 --> 02:14:36,822
[SPEAKER_15]: When you complete your term, you can have it back.

1020
02:14:37,942 --> 02:14:41,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, does it mean if it's still available or if no one had ever filled it?

1021
02:14:41,623 --> 02:14:45,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's my, as I read this, it would mean that no one had ever filled it in the interim.

1022
02:14:46,244 --> 02:14:49,865
[SPEAKER_15]: But you have these provisions here to fill vacant positions.

1023
02:14:50,225 --> 02:14:50,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1024
02:14:51,025 --> 02:14:52,586
[SPEAKER_15]: So you'd have to make an exception.

1025
02:14:52,906 --> 02:14:53,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1026
02:14:53,166 --> 02:14:53,986
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why I'm just.

1027
02:14:55,822 --> 02:15:00,544
[SPEAKER_06]: It just seems so specific to me that to make an exception, maybe it just doesn't make sense.

1028
02:15:01,764 --> 02:15:03,185
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree that it sounds theoretical.

1029
02:15:03,845 --> 02:15:06,426
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think it should apply universally or not at all.

1030
02:15:07,687 --> 02:15:13,549
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just don't really see a situation where someone says I'm serving in this role, but I'm running for school committee.

1031
02:15:14,309 --> 02:15:19,771
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they're coming, I guess is the idea that like if a teacher ran for school committee, they wanted to be a teacher again.

1032
02:15:22,136 --> 02:15:25,657
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it wouldn't necessarily need to be like their specific position.

1033
02:15:26,257 --> 02:15:28,978
[SPEAKER_06]: It could just be that a vacancy in the teaching force is there.

1034
02:15:29,018 --> 02:15:31,719
[SPEAKER_06]: So they don't have to have a one year cooling off period.

1035
02:15:33,279 --> 02:15:34,860
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not sure about that.

1036
02:15:35,020 --> 02:15:35,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1037
02:15:35,300 --> 02:15:35,600
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry.

1038
02:15:35,880 --> 02:15:38,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause that's the other piece of this where I read it just a little bit.

1039
02:15:40,602 --> 02:15:47,204
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, is it only that the high school US history teacher can return to the high school US history teacher position or right?

1040
02:15:48,904 --> 02:15:51,265
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, if they're a history teacher, do you really want them

1041
02:15:51,675 --> 02:15:53,295
[SPEAKER_15]: to return to the biology future.

1042
02:15:53,656 --> 02:15:57,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, no, but does this allow that or not allow it?

1043
02:15:57,537 --> 02:15:59,197
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more what I'm not clear on.

1044
02:16:02,758 --> 02:16:03,998
[SPEAKER_15]: It is standard.

1045
02:16:04,158 --> 02:16:06,079
[SPEAKER_15]: It does show up in almost every charter.

1046
02:16:06,099 --> 02:16:07,739
[SPEAKER_06]: It shows up in many charters, okay.

1047
02:16:12,721 --> 02:16:13,901
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems really technical.

1048
02:16:13,961 --> 02:16:15,201
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not gonna belabor it anymore.

1049
02:16:15,542 --> 02:16:20,383
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have a problem with striking it and just having it be a one year cooling off period for everybody.

1050
02:16:23,967 --> 02:16:24,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that a motion?

1051
02:16:25,407 --> 02:16:26,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1052
02:16:27,548 --> 02:16:29,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Zara?

1053
02:16:29,688 --> 02:16:37,330
[SPEAKER_26]: So we do ethics training, like we have to review ethics, the Code of Ethics every year for all state employees.

1054
02:16:37,390 --> 02:16:39,051
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, yeah, we did a little quiz.

1055
02:16:39,111 --> 02:16:51,694
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, and I've worked here, but I also, before that, I worked at UMass Boston, I've worked at the State House, I've worked in a variety of positions, and we've had to, you always have to sort of review what you're allowed to do, and this is,

1056
02:16:53,129 --> 02:16:57,831
[SPEAKER_26]: standard practice for everybody who works for the state or a city.

1057
02:16:59,432 --> 02:17:09,677
[SPEAKER_26]: So I don't think that, if it was, if it is in the section for the school committee, I think it should be in the section for the city council and the section for the mayor, or it should be in none of them.

1058
02:17:13,959 --> 02:17:21,502
[SPEAKER_26]: So this is just saying that it's not, you can't have this job and another job at the city at the same time.

1059
02:17:22,313 --> 02:17:27,835
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, so then I guess I'm saying it shouldn't just be in one section and not the other equivalent section.

1060
02:17:28,775 --> 02:17:30,016
[SPEAKER_26]: It should either be in both or neither.

1061
02:17:31,856 --> 02:17:36,878
[SPEAKER_26]: And I have no preference about which, personally, but not one.

1062
02:17:39,059 --> 02:17:48,102
[SPEAKER_26]: I guess I feel like it should, I guess, if it's an ethics violation that is already covered by the Code of Ethics for the state, I don't think it needs to be in the charter.

1063
02:17:48,202 --> 02:17:49,043
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that's where I stand.

1064
02:17:52,987 --> 02:17:55,308
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the question is actually more convoluted than that.

1065
02:17:56,669 --> 02:17:58,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that I think that was pretty.

1066
02:18:03,291 --> 02:18:08,973
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems to me as I read this but it says in the Council section to dash nine.

1067
02:18:12,834 --> 02:18:18,116
[SPEAKER_06]: It says that the counselor cannot hold the city office or appointed city employment for one year.

1068
02:18:18,977 --> 02:18:24,322
[SPEAKER_06]: It then says in 3-1 of the mayor, no former mayor shall hold any compensated appointment or city office for one year.

1069
02:18:25,243 --> 02:18:36,212
[SPEAKER_06]: But then it says under the school committee, no member of the school committee shall hold any city office or employment for one year, except if they're going back to some other position that they had before and that position is still vacant.

1070
02:18:36,553 --> 02:18:37,934
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the inconsistency.

1071
02:18:37,954 --> 02:18:45,901
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to comment on sort of taking this out because it's in the state of law.

1072
02:18:47,425 --> 02:18:57,913
[SPEAKER_15]: The point of a charter is that anybody can pick this up and figure out how your government works and not consult another document or another statute that they may or may not know about.

1073
02:18:59,074 --> 02:19:08,000
[SPEAKER_15]: So I keep it because it's part of what you're thinking of running for office and that kind of thing.

1074
02:19:08,461 --> 02:19:08,941
[SPEAKER_15]: There it is.

1075
02:19:09,001 --> 02:19:11,663
[SPEAKER_15]: It's all laid out for you in one place.

1076
02:19:11,983 --> 02:19:13,084
[SPEAKER_15]: All the things you need to know.

1077
02:19:13,404 --> 02:19:15,286
[SPEAKER_06]: The only thing I'm considering proposing is saying,

1078
02:19:16,793 --> 02:19:17,914
[SPEAKER_06]: make it the same for all three.

1079
02:19:17,934 --> 02:19:30,580
[SPEAKER_06]: No one can serve for a year regardless of position and not have this special exception just to the school committee that says that they could return back to something whereas a counselor or a mayor could not.

1080
02:19:32,481 --> 02:19:39,205
[SPEAKER_06]: So keep it in that there's a one year cooling off but not have this additional language around the school committee that doesn't exist in the other two sections.

1081
02:19:40,766 --> 02:19:42,146
[SPEAKER_06]: If that makes sense.

1082
02:19:46,292 --> 02:19:53,535
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a question about what happens when state law changes or the state code of ethics changes.

1083
02:19:53,795 --> 02:19:55,936
[SPEAKER_09]: They might make it more stringent or less stringent.

1084
02:19:57,017 --> 02:19:59,478
[SPEAKER_09]: What would rule then with that law?

1085
02:19:59,598 --> 02:20:01,619
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a uniform state law, so that would rule.

1086
02:20:01,939 --> 02:20:02,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Got it.

1087
02:20:02,379 --> 02:20:02,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1088
02:20:02,919 --> 02:20:09,742
[SPEAKER_15]: But in terms of putting the document together, we might as well have it be as comprehensive as we can make it at the moment.

1089
02:20:10,083 --> 02:20:10,383
[SPEAKER_08]: I see.

1090
02:20:10,823 --> 02:20:11,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1091
02:20:13,203 --> 02:20:19,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I would just move to strike after the semicolon beginning with the word provided, and then it's consistent across all three bodies.

1092
02:20:21,186 --> 02:20:26,408
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have a motion from President Beres to strike after the semicolon?

1093
02:20:26,428 --> 02:20:27,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1094
02:20:27,848 --> 02:20:31,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Starting from the word provided until the end?

1095
02:20:31,950 --> 02:20:32,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1096
02:20:32,430 --> 02:20:36,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, until the end of the section.

1097
02:20:37,752 --> 02:20:40,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have any other comments from councilors?

1098
02:20:43,993 --> 02:20:47,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, do we have comments from members of the public?

1099
02:20:51,579 --> 02:21:02,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, we have a motion from President Behrs to strike from after the semicolon, starting with the word provided to the end of the session.

1100
02:21:08,974 --> 02:21:10,335
[SPEAKER_09]: Whenever you're ready to call the roll.

1101
02:21:10,355 --> 02:21:11,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, do we have a second for the motion?

1102
02:21:12,377 --> 02:21:13,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Second from Councilor Zahra.

1103
02:21:16,019 --> 02:21:17,040
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Collins.

1104
02:21:19,402 --> 02:21:19,642
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1105
02:21:21,743 --> 02:21:22,504
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Zahra.

1106
02:21:22,524 --> 02:21:22,584
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1107
02:21:24,345 --> 02:21:25,165
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Scapelli.

1108
02:21:27,107 --> 02:21:27,327
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

1109
02:21:27,627 --> 02:21:28,187
[SPEAKER_21]: Chairman Singh.

1110
02:21:28,547 --> 02:21:28,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1111
02:21:29,868 --> 02:21:30,529
[SPEAKER_09]: President Beers.

1112
02:21:30,849 --> 02:21:31,029
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1113
02:21:31,890 --> 02:21:34,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Four in the affirmative, one in the negative.

1114
02:21:34,271 --> 02:21:35,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

1115
02:21:35,932 --> 02:21:38,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any other comments about section 4-3?

1116
02:21:39,695 --> 02:21:40,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none.

1117
02:21:41,739 --> 02:21:43,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Section 4-4, compensation.

1118
02:21:46,141 --> 02:21:50,362
[SPEAKER_09]: We might want to take this up at the end with the other compensation provisions.

1119
02:21:51,423 --> 02:21:57,365
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that being said, moving on to section 4-5, powers and duties.

1120
02:21:57,445 --> 02:22:04,187
[SPEAKER_09]: I do have written comments from school committee members on this provision, but I will defer to councilors first.

1121
02:22:09,035 --> 02:22:13,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing no, President Behrs?

1122
02:22:13,940 --> 02:22:22,667
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the proposal from Member Russo is technical or clerical, just changing the word department to the word system.

1123
02:22:25,530 --> 02:22:31,575
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would support moving that, but if you want to read Member Graham's, I would think we should have a conversation about this.

1124
02:22:31,636 --> 02:22:32,857
[SPEAKER_06]: I have some questions about it.

1125
02:22:32,877 --> 02:22:33,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1126
02:22:35,747 --> 02:22:41,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Going to Vice Chair Graham's comment on section 4-5.

1127
02:22:41,808 --> 02:22:48,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Section 4-5 inaccurately describes the hiring process for key positions within the school committee.

1128
02:22:48,910 --> 02:22:57,391
[SPEAKER_09]: The school committee under Massachusetts law holds the authority to directly hire the business manager, director of special education, school physician, and legal counsel.

1129
02:22:57,851 --> 02:23:00,912
[SPEAKER_09]: These positions are not hired at the recommendation of the superintendent.

1130
02:23:01,552 --> 02:23:08,637
[SPEAKER_09]: It is essential that this language be revised to reflect your legal authority and maintain clarity on the roles of both the school committee and the superintendent.

1131
02:23:09,117 --> 02:23:14,200
[SPEAKER_09]: This distinction is critical to preserving the school committee's oversight and accountability in these areas.

1132
02:23:15,161 --> 02:23:16,802
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's from Vice Chair Graham.

1133
02:23:18,423 --> 02:23:24,106
[SPEAKER_09]: President Behrs mentioned a comment from Member Rousseau, which I will read.

1134
02:23:25,447 --> 02:23:30,470
[SPEAKER_09]: He says, in subsection B, sub-subsection B,

1135
02:23:31,873 --> 02:23:49,364
[SPEAKER_09]: three, so the very end of the section, he is asking us to, it's a clerical change, to change the word department to system, saying that, he says, the school system is not a department of the city of Medford and this change will accurately reflect its status.

1136
02:23:50,205 --> 02:23:50,725
[SPEAKER_09]: And member

1137
02:23:54,107 --> 02:24:02,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ntapa says, I don't see issues with 4-5 other than the one of the lawyer in me asking what can be defined as reasonable.

1138
02:24:02,751 --> 02:24:04,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it just anything justifiable?

1139
02:24:07,613 --> 02:24:08,674
[SPEAKER_09]: I could be corrected on this.

1140
02:24:08,754 --> 02:24:11,954
[SPEAKER_09]: I think reasonable usually implies some objective standard.

1141
02:24:12,575 --> 02:24:27,959
[SPEAKER_09]: And the judges or juries, but this is a civil matter, whoever is deciding will probably use a standard of what seems most objective to determine reasonableness.

1142
02:24:31,270 --> 02:24:34,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are the comments I have written from school committee members.

1143
02:24:34,591 --> 02:24:41,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any other comments from sitting members of the school committee or from city councilors?

1144
02:24:45,674 --> 02:24:48,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, are there any comments from the public?

1145
02:24:52,196 --> 02:24:54,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, do we have any motions?

1146
02:24:55,557 --> 02:24:56,117
[SPEAKER_09]: President Behrs?

1147
02:24:57,357 --> 02:25:00,318
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a question for our representatives from the Collins Center.

1148
02:25:01,286 --> 02:25:20,615
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like there's a question from member Graham around the words upon recommendation of the superintendent in section four, five, subsection B, subsection one, upon the recommendation of the superintendent to establish and appoint these following positions as authorized by general law.

1149
02:25:22,716 --> 02:25:30,640
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess I'm just wondering, does that, member Graham seems to be saying that the hiring of those positions is by the school committee

1150
02:25:31,560 --> 02:25:38,542
[SPEAKER_06]: and that having the words upon the recommendation of the superintendent would reduce the authority that the school committee would have relative to the general law.

1151
02:25:39,523 --> 02:25:43,304
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm wondering, is that, is that how you interpret this?

1152
02:25:43,324 --> 02:25:45,265
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, I think we should get into that a little bit more.

1153
02:25:59,190 --> 02:26:00,531
[SPEAKER_15]: It feels to me like, oh, I'm sorry.

1154
02:26:00,611 --> 02:26:02,553
[SPEAKER_15]: It feels like a question of semantics.

1155
02:26:02,953 --> 02:26:03,274
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

1156
02:26:03,354 --> 02:26:19,047
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, where is, this person is applying for a job and probably the school committee, I mean, the school superintendent is gonna provide some resumes for the committee to look at.

1157
02:26:20,769 --> 02:26:26,754
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't see it as particularly limiting.

1158
02:26:29,958 --> 02:26:44,070
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess my question is if there were three resumes and the superintendent made a recommendation of one, but the school committee wanted to choose another person, would the school committee still be able to do that?

1159
02:26:44,130 --> 02:26:50,015
[SPEAKER_15]: Within the rules and regulations of the school committee or their procedures, they can address this.

1160
02:26:50,535 --> 02:26:50,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1161
02:26:51,256 --> 02:26:52,036
[SPEAKER_15]: You see what I'm saying?

1162
02:26:52,237 --> 02:26:58,462
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, we shall receive every resume or we shall receive the ones that you have evaluated

1163
02:27:00,143 --> 02:27:05,369
[SPEAKER_15]: that the superintendent has evaluated and chooses to pass on to us that's the decision of the school committee.

1164
02:27:06,836 --> 02:27:30,055
[SPEAKER_09]: yes but i think i think that's that's internal to the school committee's process i don't think it needs to be in here i i have to say that's not how i read this section at all um and i think if you read the text really closely um it says and upon the recommendation of the superintendent so i think that almost definitely says you have to have the recommendation of the superintendent

1165
02:27:31,512 --> 02:27:33,674
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's my interpretation of the matter.

1166
02:27:33,714 --> 02:27:34,994
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't cut you off.

1167
02:27:35,215 --> 02:27:37,816
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I mean, that's kind of how I'm interpreting it too.

1168
02:27:37,836 --> 02:27:42,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Because right before that it says subject only to policy guidelines and directives adopted by the school committee.

1169
02:27:43,400 --> 02:27:53,628
[SPEAKER_06]: And it seems to me that if the school committee wanted to define a policy guideline and directive that they wanted to consider only the recommendations of the superintendent, they could do that.

1170
02:27:54,108 --> 02:27:59,552
[SPEAKER_06]: But that by putting it in, it adds language that could be interpreted differently depending on

1171
02:28:00,958 --> 02:28:05,140
[SPEAKER_06]: the different person involved or litigation.

1172
02:28:05,861 --> 02:28:12,424
[SPEAKER_15]: It does seem extra in terms of the phrase that appears before it.

1173
02:28:12,964 --> 02:28:14,645
[SPEAKER_15]: I do think it's internal to the committee.

1174
02:28:14,845 --> 02:28:15,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1175
02:28:15,726 --> 02:28:22,389
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if it's internal, then we should strike the phrase and just keep it internal and not have it be a potentially conflicted

1176
02:28:23,603 --> 02:28:23,903
[SPEAKER_09]: I am.

1177
02:28:24,203 --> 02:28:25,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that a motion?

1178
02:28:25,504 --> 02:28:32,067
[SPEAKER_06]: I would move, yeah, just to strike that language, since it seems to be covered under the previous phrase, if the school committee wants to have that process.

1179
02:28:33,608 --> 02:28:33,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1180
02:28:34,128 --> 02:28:36,349
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have a motion from President Berrios.

1181
02:28:36,369 --> 02:28:37,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me just get this right.

1182
02:28:37,289 --> 02:28:41,231
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a motion to strike the words and upon the recommendation of the superintendent.

1183
02:28:41,731 --> 02:28:41,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1184
02:28:42,271 --> 02:28:42,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1185
02:28:44,312 --> 02:28:45,893
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we haven't gotten the public comment yet.

1186
02:28:45,973 --> 02:28:47,834
[SPEAKER_09]: We were just working out the motion.

1187
02:28:48,114 --> 02:28:48,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1188
02:28:49,835 --> 02:28:50,235
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1189
02:28:51,654 --> 02:28:52,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1190
02:28:52,114 --> 02:28:55,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any other comments from councillors on this section?

1191
02:28:55,717 --> 02:28:57,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just no, just to that comment.

1192
02:28:59,240 --> 02:29:02,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, are there any public comments on this?

1193
02:29:08,710 --> 02:29:09,932
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize, I probably missed something.

1194
02:29:10,492 --> 02:29:12,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Sharon Hayes, 69 Ripley Road.

1195
02:29:12,835 --> 02:29:24,530
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to make the comment that in terms of the recommendation of the superintendent, that is found in both recommendations and guidelines from DESE and from MASC.

1196
02:29:24,930 --> 02:29:42,608
[SPEAKER_03]: So the language used by the Charter Committee is pulled exactly from what Jesse recommends, because they do recommend that while state law is very clear about the fact that the school committee can select and terminate the superintendent, the other positions are not so clear.

1197
02:29:42,728 --> 02:29:46,232
[SPEAKER_03]: And so both, I'm trying to find the wording if you'd like to hear it.

1198
02:29:53,298 --> 02:30:01,139
[SPEAKER_03]: The school committee hires a superintendent and assistant superintendents and should rely on the superintendent to hire the other personnel from serving the school district.

1199
02:30:02,500 --> 02:30:12,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Future legislation may clarify the statutes, I'm sorry I'm trying to find the exact, but both Jesse and here's the MAS version of it, they say

1200
02:30:13,642 --> 02:30:30,286
[SPEAKER_03]: The school committee shall appoint the superintendent, shall appoint the assistant associate superintendent, school business administrator, administrator of special education, school physicians and registered nurses, legal counsel and supervisors of attendance upon recommendation of the superintendent.

1201
02:30:30,726 --> 02:30:36,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Consent to hiring based on the superintendent's recommendation should not be unreasonably withheld.

1202
02:30:37,688 --> 02:30:41,469
[SPEAKER_03]: So it really does say that it should be, it's not the sole,

1203
02:30:43,727 --> 02:30:50,232
[SPEAKER_03]: authority of the school committee, that it's the school committee appoints based on the recommendation of the superintendent.

1204
02:30:52,713 --> 02:30:57,757
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to clarify that that language is taken directly from both DESE and from MASC.

1205
02:30:58,855 --> 02:30:59,795
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's helpful.

1206
02:31:01,016 --> 02:31:12,539
[SPEAKER_09]: I will say I've just been informed that the school committee's legal counsel is asking the city council to make amendments to this to clarify what the school committee can and cannot do.

1207
02:31:12,599 --> 02:31:13,540
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're asking for change.

1208
02:31:19,061 --> 02:31:21,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any other public comments on?

1209
02:31:22,182 --> 02:31:22,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, yeah.

1210
02:31:23,663 --> 02:31:24,283
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll give you one sec.

1211
02:31:25,028 --> 02:31:31,532
[SPEAKER_06]: No, just that this comes from, it seems like this all stems from chapter 71, section 59, which has a third way of defining this.

1212
02:31:31,793 --> 02:31:43,260
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, upon the recommendation, the school committee may also establish and appoint these positions or self-report to, but that the school committee shall, then the next phrase is the school committee shall approve or disapprove of the hiring of said positions.

1213
02:31:44,241 --> 02:31:51,306
[SPEAKER_06]: And given what our friends from Collins Center said was that basically this is internal to the process that the school committee is setting up anyway.

1214
02:31:53,310 --> 02:31:56,231
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're having a convoluted argument about trying to do the same thing.

1215
02:31:56,451 --> 02:31:59,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you explain further what clarification is being asked?

1216
02:31:59,952 --> 02:32:12,615
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the school system's lawyer in reading the charter, he's just confused, period, and he is worried that this

1217
02:32:16,030 --> 02:32:28,818
[SPEAKER_09]: this charter would mean that they have approval of the super's pick at the hiring, but they won't have any say on the renewal process and that hiring versus extension is a big deal.

1218
02:32:28,999 --> 02:32:33,381
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's important for us to clarify when it comes to the school committee's power.

1219
02:32:34,182 --> 02:32:41,707
[SPEAKER_09]: We could also leave this for the committee of the whole and ask for more detailed feedback from the school committee's legal counsel.

1220
02:32:42,027 --> 02:32:54,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it sounds like we should get a recommendation from counsel to the school committee as to specific language to clarify the different sourcings of all of the different possible interpretations of this.

1221
02:32:56,014 --> 02:33:09,521
[SPEAKER_06]: So I amend my motion to request a specific language be proposed by counsel to the school committee or that they suggest language that addresses their concerns.

1222
02:33:13,905 --> 02:33:20,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any other comments from city councilors or sitting school community members on this?

1223
02:33:23,934 --> 02:33:24,915
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none.

1224
02:33:26,036 --> 02:33:32,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have further public comment on President Behrs' amended motion to ask for legal advice?

1225
02:33:34,544 --> 02:33:35,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none.

1226
02:33:37,206 --> 02:33:39,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have a second for President Behrs' motion?

1227
02:33:42,096 --> 02:33:43,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by Councilor Zaro.

1228
02:33:44,677 --> 02:33:46,377
[SPEAKER_09]: When you're ready, Mr. Clerk.

1229
02:33:52,560 --> 02:33:53,560
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Collins.

1230
02:33:54,220 --> 02:33:54,460
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1231
02:33:56,201 --> 02:33:57,021
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Zaro.

1232
02:33:58,842 --> 02:33:59,682
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Scopelli.

1233
02:34:02,563 --> 02:34:03,163
[SPEAKER_21]: Chairman Singh.

1234
02:34:03,363 --> 02:34:03,563
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1235
02:34:04,363 --> 02:34:05,004
[SPEAKER_21]: President Peers.

1236
02:34:05,444 --> 02:34:06,284
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1237
02:34:06,344 --> 02:34:07,965
[SPEAKER_09]: For an affirmative, one negative.

1238
02:34:08,045 --> 02:34:08,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

1239
02:34:10,980 --> 02:34:14,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on to section 4-6, filling of vacancies.

1240
02:34:14,203 --> 02:34:18,547
[SPEAKER_09]: I do have some comments from members.

1241
02:34:19,668 --> 02:34:20,789
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll defer to councilors first.

1242
02:34:25,173 --> 02:34:27,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none.

1243
02:34:27,815 --> 02:34:32,519
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me read what has been sent in on 4-6.

1244
02:34:36,274 --> 02:34:51,719
[SPEAKER_09]: The member Rousseau, he's not making a recommendation, but he's pointing out, there's a comment about the point, the line that says vacancy shall be immediately sworn and shall serve for the remainder of the current term.

1245
02:34:53,260 --> 02:35:03,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to give people context, because I know this is kind of a long paragraph, essentially this is saying that if a vacancy shows up on the school committee before the next election,

1246
02:35:04,965 --> 02:35:11,530
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe this is given a certain time frame.

1247
02:35:14,591 --> 02:35:21,394
[SPEAKER_09]: So essentially what the current charter lets us do is the school committee in the city council would fill the vacancy.

1248
02:35:21,814 --> 02:35:31,739
[SPEAKER_09]: But then when it comes time to the next regular election, we assume that someone's going to be elected to that position, could be the same person, could be someone different.

1249
02:35:32,239 --> 02:35:37,101
[SPEAKER_09]: And so what the current charter asks us to do is swear in that person who's elected immediately.

1250
02:35:37,981 --> 02:35:49,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, instead of with the rest of the school committee in the City Council and the issue that was identified is that, um, Member Rousseau says that the suggested process is inefficient and burdensome.

1251
02:35:49,066 --> 02:35:55,089
[SPEAKER_09]: School community members undergo extensive orientation, including legal and or other training necessary for effectiveness.

1252
02:35:55,549 --> 02:36:01,772
[SPEAKER_09]: State law mandates attendance at a course offered by our professional association early in our first term.

1253
02:36:01,992 --> 02:36:06,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Having this process occur once in November and then again in January is wasteful.

1254
02:36:07,094 --> 02:36:11,038
[SPEAKER_09]: and the superintendent of schools manages this process of orientation.

1255
02:36:11,638 --> 02:36:20,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Additionally, having two separate inauguration slash swearing in timeframes lacks rationale and is unfair to those being sworn in immediately after the election.

1256
02:36:22,428 --> 02:36:23,188
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was

1257
02:36:25,432 --> 02:36:26,773
[SPEAKER_09]: from Member Rousseau.

1258
02:36:26,853 --> 02:36:35,418
[SPEAKER_09]: We also have a comment from Member Ntapa and then I know Chair McDonald sent me a clarification.

1259
02:36:35,538 --> 02:36:42,642
[SPEAKER_09]: So Member Ntapa says, I'm also delighted to see in addition to vacancies being filled,

1260
02:36:43,302 --> 02:36:57,107
[SPEAKER_09]: As you may know, my appointment slash election to the committee was filled with uncertainties waving wavering past precedent and consistent back and forth without knowing proper order as the city current city charter does not define how vacancies are filled.

1261
02:36:59,181 --> 02:37:05,568
[SPEAKER_09]: It led to a serious lag in my adoption to the committee, which, as you know, was rapidly approaching budget season.

1262
02:37:06,048 --> 02:37:17,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Our member in Taupo notes to me right now that it's not stated in the charter what happens and that we have to go through past precedent to find out how to fill that slot.

1263
02:37:17,960 --> 02:37:18,961
[SPEAKER_09]: He further adds

1264
02:37:19,662 --> 02:37:30,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Does 4-6B have a typo in stating that they will be referred to as office of ward counselor, 4-6A refers to them as office of school committee at large.

1265
02:37:30,672 --> 02:37:32,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I did not read the definition section well enough.

1266
02:37:32,894 --> 02:37:36,597
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is what Chair McDonald emailed me to say that there is a clerical error here.

1267
02:37:36,617 --> 02:37:42,563
[SPEAKER_09]: So we should make a, I would recommend to the committee that someone make a motion to fix that error.

1268
02:37:45,490 --> 02:37:51,298
[SPEAKER_09]: So in 4-6B, it says Office of Ward Counselor instead of Office of School Committee at large.

1269
02:37:54,683 --> 02:37:56,766
[SPEAKER_09]: B as in boy.

1270
02:37:58,381 --> 02:38:14,192
[SPEAKER_09]: He also said, I do however have slight issues with section four dash six see those who are appointed by the committee slash Council if no one else is willing or eligible in regards to the candidate filling the slot not being labeled as candidate for reelection, it feels a disservice to the work that they have been doing.

1271
02:38:14,212 --> 02:38:16,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, they weren't chosen by the voters.

1272
02:38:16,553 --> 02:38:21,796
[SPEAKER_09]: They may not have been, quote, elected, but they were a full member of the committee and should be addressed as such in some way.

1273
02:38:22,276 --> 02:38:29,719
[SPEAKER_09]: I recommend languages such as, quote, former committee appointment or whatever is best advised by those who understand that language a lot better than I do.

1274
02:38:30,360 --> 02:38:32,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this precedent set by the Commonwealth?

1275
02:38:32,601 --> 02:38:37,763
[SPEAKER_09]: As my understanding is that even the, quote, appointment committee makeup is state guidance.

1276
02:38:38,484 --> 02:38:45,287
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm making an assumption that 4-6C only refers to those appointed by the committee and not those who are runners up.

1277
02:38:45,747 --> 02:38:50,111
[SPEAKER_09]: and those outlined in 4-6a and b will be labeled as candidate for re-election.

1278
02:38:51,452 --> 02:38:57,376
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are the comments I had from sitting members of the school committee on this section.

1279
02:38:57,516 --> 02:39:00,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any other comments from sitting members of the school committee?

1280
02:39:02,020 --> 02:39:07,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, I see President Behrs is first and then Councilor Lazaro.

1281
02:39:08,205 --> 02:39:11,067
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just going to make the motion to make the clerical change.

1282
02:39:12,465 --> 02:39:15,446
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a motion from President Behrs to make a clerical change.

1283
02:39:16,787 --> 02:39:17,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Lazzaro, did you still?

1284
02:39:19,008 --> 02:39:21,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1285
02:39:21,109 --> 02:39:23,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have a second for the motion for the clerical change?

1286
02:39:27,472 --> 02:39:30,054
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have a second on that motion from Councilor Lazzaro.

1287
02:39:30,174 --> 02:39:31,835
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll go over to public comments.

1288
02:39:34,416 --> 02:39:35,957
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're in person, please line up.

1289
02:39:36,037 --> 02:39:38,698
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're on Zoom, please raise your hand.

1290
02:39:43,473 --> 02:39:48,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, whenever you're ready, Mr. Clerk, the clerical error.

1291
02:39:48,455 --> 02:39:54,917
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the President Beers' motion to fix the clerical error in 4-6B, as seconded by Councilor Lozaro.

1292
02:39:56,978 --> 02:39:57,958
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Collins.

1293
02:39:59,899 --> 02:40:00,139
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1294
02:40:02,059 --> 02:40:02,860
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Lozaro.

1295
02:40:02,880 --> 02:40:03,560
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1296
02:40:04,680 --> 02:40:05,581
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1297
02:40:08,382 --> 02:40:08,982
[SPEAKER_21]: Chairman Singh.

1298
02:40:09,262 --> 02:40:09,482
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1299
02:40:10,602 --> 02:40:11,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President Beers.

1300
02:40:11,663 --> 02:40:11,883
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1301
02:40:12,284 --> 02:40:15,766
[SPEAKER_09]: We have five in favor and none opposed.

1302
02:40:16,046 --> 02:40:16,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

1303
02:40:17,927 --> 02:40:20,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Very grateful to have a five to zero vote.

1304
02:40:22,229 --> 02:40:30,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on to section four, or I guess we're done with the school committee sections absent the compensation piece.

1305
02:40:31,915 --> 02:40:37,758
[SPEAKER_09]: The next section that we had on our docket was article eight on citizen participation mechanisms.

1306
02:40:41,262 --> 02:40:42,863
[SPEAKER_09]: We just go to that real quick.

1307
02:40:42,883 --> 02:40:52,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I do have comments from elected officials on this.

1308
02:40:52,906 --> 02:40:55,227
[SPEAKER_09]: I see Councilor Lemming first though.

1309
02:40:58,848 --> 02:41:01,689
[SPEAKER_22]: Are we just doing 8.1 or Section 8 as a?

1310
02:41:01,809 --> 02:41:02,169
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, just 8.1.

1311
02:41:02,209 --> 02:41:02,289
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1312
02:41:04,123 --> 02:41:13,889
[SPEAKER_22]: So just for the folks watching, I already did publish a blog post about Section 8 on my website.

1313
02:41:13,929 --> 02:41:19,973
[SPEAKER_22]: So hopefully, none of the recommendations I'm going to make on this tonight come as a surprise.

1314
02:41:20,053 --> 02:41:25,997
[SPEAKER_22]: If you're interested in reading about it more, it's on my website, mattlemming.com.

1315
02:41:26,037 --> 02:41:30,260
[SPEAKER_22]: So with 8-1, my main issue with it is that I don't

1316
02:41:34,248 --> 02:41:45,852
[SPEAKER_22]: really see a benefit to keeping it over public participation that's already in the city council agendas.

1317
02:41:46,392 --> 02:41:58,417
[SPEAKER_22]: So what this does is it lets anybody who gets a petition that is signed by 25 voters to put essentially anything they want on a city council agenda or school committee agenda.

1318
02:41:59,057 --> 02:42:01,898
[SPEAKER_22]: And then folks are free to

1319
02:42:03,458 --> 02:42:05,621
[SPEAKER_22]: basically submit as many of those as I want.

1320
02:42:06,342 --> 02:42:08,225
[SPEAKER_22]: Either body has to hold a hearing on it.

1321
02:42:09,266 --> 02:42:14,894
[SPEAKER_22]: And then, yeah, but I mean, the thing that gets me about this is that

1322
02:42:15,798 --> 02:42:32,305
[SPEAKER_22]: people are already allowed at city council meetings to show up and say anything that they like people have done that before to speak about different issues, and they're still free to do that in the, in the future so

1323
02:42:32,925 --> 02:42:34,767
[SPEAKER_22]: My recommend so my recommendation.

1324
02:42:34,787 --> 02:42:48,304
[SPEAKER_22]: My first recommendation is just to strike the whole thing I do see I see it as something that could easily be abused, particularly because the signature count is so the threshold to get something on an agenda is so low.

1325
02:42:50,553 --> 02:43:04,040
[SPEAKER_22]: I did communicate with one member of the charter study committee about this and there, I think the justification for this was that previous in previous years advocates had such a hard time getting elected officials to respond to them.

1326
02:43:06,482 --> 02:43:11,825
[SPEAKER_22]: And so they just want a mechanism to sort of get elected officials to listen and respond, I think.

1327
02:43:13,278 --> 02:43:21,824
[SPEAKER_22]: In some of these, if there's a hearing on the agenda, I don't think that elected officials necessarily are put in a position where they have to respond to something.

1328
02:43:21,985 --> 02:43:24,686
[SPEAKER_22]: There is a mechanism for doing so in section 8-2.

1329
02:43:25,267 --> 02:43:32,252
[SPEAKER_22]: But yeah, my personal view of this, and I can't make a motion because I'm not on this subcommittee, but if my colleagues

1330
02:43:34,118 --> 02:43:43,411
[SPEAKER_22]: my colleagues feel similarly, then I would recommend this be struck, or if not, then at least the threshold of 25 signatures be raised.

1331
02:43:43,732 --> 02:43:44,012
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1332
02:43:45,084 --> 02:43:46,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

1333
02:43:47,105 --> 02:44:08,990
[SPEAKER_09]: I talked very briefly to the call center reps last meeting about the thresholds, and I just want to put it out there that they mentioned that a lot of this is more boilerplate and is adjustable from municipality to municipality, given what we know of our political situation here in the city and what is right for our city.

1334
02:44:09,050 --> 02:44:13,992
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's less of a legal problem, more of a judgment situation.

1335
02:44:14,692 --> 02:44:16,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Councillor Scarpelli.

1336
02:44:17,513 --> 02:44:18,333
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

1337
02:44:18,393 --> 02:44:34,516
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, I feel that by any any motions to eliminate any avenue to have residents bring forth an issue of concern, I think is irresponsible.

1338
02:44:35,036 --> 02:44:42,097
[SPEAKER_20]: I think my fellow council just mentioned that the reason that some of the former members of members of the Chatter Review Committee

1339
02:44:42,580 --> 02:44:47,083
[SPEAKER_20]: so that maybe it was at a time when counselors weren't listening, so they needed that platform.

1340
02:44:47,543 --> 02:44:49,464
[SPEAKER_20]: That still holds true.

1341
02:44:50,524 --> 02:44:55,727
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think that, like Councilor Beas said, there's gonna be sides, right?

1342
02:44:56,208 --> 02:45:09,915
[SPEAKER_20]: And having the opportunity for residents to petition and follow through the process the correct way, as written in the charter, I think that it doesn't limit the participation or the involvement of our residents.

1343
02:45:11,300 --> 02:45:23,044
[SPEAKER_20]: I would leave this alone, or again, it would be another example of what we've been seeing moving forward in the lack of really listening to our residents.

1344
02:45:23,084 --> 02:45:28,486
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's what I'm seeing and what I'm hearing.

1345
02:45:28,546 --> 02:45:30,086
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you, Mr. Chair.

1346
02:45:30,767 --> 02:45:32,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1347
02:45:32,527 --> 02:45:33,147
[SPEAKER_06]: President Behrs?

1348
02:45:34,488 --> 02:45:39,430
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the question here over what we currently have is a question of a public hearing.

1349
02:45:39,450 --> 02:45:40,370
[SPEAKER_06]: What does that mean?

1350
02:45:41,713 --> 02:45:44,056
[SPEAKER_06]: and requiring action to be taken.

1351
02:45:46,058 --> 02:45:51,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, any one resident can put a petition on or just come to a meeting and say whatever they want.

1352
02:45:55,326 --> 02:46:02,914
[SPEAKER_06]: So this would actually significantly raise the bar on that front requiring 25 signatures, et cetera.

1353
02:46:02,934 --> 02:46:05,756
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think the question is,

1354
02:46:06,874 --> 02:46:08,975
[SPEAKER_06]: about requiring action, what is a public hearing?

1355
02:46:09,015 --> 02:46:10,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, public hearings are clearly defined.

1356
02:46:11,196 --> 02:46:12,257
[SPEAKER_06]: We do them for zoning.

1357
02:46:12,297 --> 02:46:17,900
[SPEAKER_06]: We do them for petitions for specific special permits.

1358
02:46:19,581 --> 02:46:35,290
[SPEAKER_06]: So it just seems to me to be, I don't know if it seems to be trying to enshrine in the charter process that is

1359
02:46:37,091 --> 02:46:43,848
[SPEAKER_06]: potentially more onerous than the existing process that we have now by the city council rules which this council hasn't voted to adjust so.

1360
02:46:47,418 --> 02:46:57,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I certainly think if we're talking about having a public hearing and requiring action right now, the only people who can put anything on the city council agenda are members of the city council and the mayor.

1361
02:46:57,845 --> 02:46:59,446
[SPEAKER_06]: And this significantly reduces that.

1362
02:47:02,448 --> 02:47:05,109
[SPEAKER_06]: So the threshold I think should be a question.

1363
02:47:05,129 --> 02:47:14,836
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I think it's also a question of how it changes existing public participation processes where right now you can go to the clerk's office as an individual and file a petition to appear under public participation.

1364
02:47:15,775 --> 02:47:16,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1365
02:47:16,696 --> 02:47:17,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1366
02:47:17,356 --> 02:47:19,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I have a few counselors.

1367
02:47:19,578 --> 02:47:20,879
[SPEAKER_09]: I've, um, in order.

1368
02:47:20,979 --> 02:47:25,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Council is our counselor Scarpelli and then, uh, me, uh, counselor.

1369
02:47:25,242 --> 02:47:25,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me possibly.

1370
02:47:27,144 --> 02:47:27,484
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1371
02:47:27,504 --> 02:47:32,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, the Oh, and, uh, Vice President Collins.

1372
02:47:32,988 --> 02:47:43,736
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, the current City Council, um, also holds listening sessions monthly at

1373
02:47:44,723 --> 02:47:52,327
[SPEAKER_26]: the senior center, we received emails and outreach that way.

1374
02:47:52,827 --> 02:48:12,196
[SPEAKER_26]: And there was recently something that was brought forward about students whose parents were advocating for more programs for kids with disabilities to have access to programming in the recreation department without having

1375
02:48:14,710 --> 02:48:22,113
[SPEAKER_26]: signatures, but that's because you can email councillors and you can get on the agenda in that manner.

1376
02:48:23,134 --> 02:48:33,098
[SPEAKER_26]: But the petition to do it, to participate in public participation at the end of the agenda, as President Behrs mentioned, is already accessible.

1377
02:48:33,959 --> 02:48:42,723
[SPEAKER_26]: The other thing I would say is that with the change to either ward or district-based representation, the argument there is that

1378
02:48:44,049 --> 02:48:50,675
[SPEAKER_26]: there would be greater access to your neighborhood's counselors.

1379
02:48:50,755 --> 02:49:06,171
[SPEAKER_26]: So my concern about this section is that the 25 signature requirement, I think, gives me

1380
02:49:08,713 --> 02:49:33,819
[SPEAKER_26]: an inclination that somebody could sort of flood the council with, or school committee, with petitions to have a hearing on things that are not related to the agenda of the elected council based on 25 people that did not vote for who is in office.

1381
02:49:35,831 --> 02:49:57,428
[SPEAKER_26]: I would be curious to hear if that is something that has, like, I understand this is boilerplate language, but since this isn't part of our charter now, this would be new stuff for us if you could talk to me about how other cities, if this is something that frequently happens, if there are examples of scenarios in which that would occur.

1382
02:49:57,708 --> 02:50:04,013
[SPEAKER_26]: We already have, as we mentioned, you can just hop on public participation and that's fully allowed now.

1383
02:50:04,573 --> 02:50:09,154
[SPEAKER_26]: So can you just talk to me about how it's done?

1384
02:50:09,194 --> 02:50:11,635
[SPEAKER_15]: This section appears in almost every city charter.

1385
02:50:12,855 --> 02:50:21,097
[SPEAKER_15]: It is intended to provide a visibility for a particular issue where the petitioners are looking for the passage of a measure.

1386
02:50:26,258 --> 02:50:30,379
[SPEAKER_15]: So the hearing can be held by the council at whole or a council subcommittee.

1387
02:50:31,080 --> 02:50:32,760
[SPEAKER_15]: And in terms of taking action,

1388
02:50:33,547 --> 02:50:41,213
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not that you have to pass the proposed measure as it's presented to you.

1389
02:50:42,234 --> 02:50:44,836
[SPEAKER_15]: It's that you respond to the petitioners.

1390
02:50:45,556 --> 02:50:55,103
[SPEAKER_15]: And holding the public hearing is a way for these 25 or 50 people, or however many, to present written testimony, to present oral testimony.

1391
02:50:56,004 --> 02:50:58,466
[SPEAKER_15]: And basically, the public hearing is where you just listen.

1392
02:51:01,478 --> 02:51:04,519
[SPEAKER_15]: And communities have used this.

1393
02:51:10,421 --> 02:51:21,165
[SPEAKER_26]: My response is only, and I guess it's not the fact that it's here, it's the fact that we do this.

1394
02:51:21,385 --> 02:51:28,307
[SPEAKER_26]: It's not that we need to remove it, it's just that we are doing it, but it's because our charter is two pages long.

1395
02:51:28,327 --> 02:51:29,908
[SPEAKER_26]: We don't have that written down right now.

1396
02:51:30,749 --> 02:51:41,021
[SPEAKER_26]: We receive outreach from advocate groups or individuals asking us to do something if it's right, but you're not, you're not giving, but they don't have a stage necessarily.

1397
02:51:42,456 --> 02:51:43,818
[SPEAKER_15]: They don't have a stage.

1398
02:51:43,858 --> 02:51:45,880
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, they have public participation.

1399
02:51:45,960 --> 02:51:46,441
[SPEAKER_26]: No, they do.

1400
02:51:46,801 --> 02:51:47,101
[SPEAKER_26]: They do.

1401
02:51:47,161 --> 02:51:47,922
[SPEAKER_26]: They come and they speak.

1402
02:51:48,102 --> 02:51:50,465
[SPEAKER_26]: They line up and speak and they do have a stage.

1403
02:51:50,525 --> 02:51:50,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1404
02:51:50,805 --> 02:51:56,671
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, this was just to be, you know, more formalized.

1405
02:51:56,851 --> 02:51:57,412
[SPEAKER_26]: I understand.

1406
02:51:57,872 --> 02:51:58,253
[SPEAKER_26]: I understand.

1407
02:51:58,733 --> 02:52:00,115
[SPEAKER_26]: So it's a process that's written down.

1408
02:52:07,603 --> 02:52:07,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1409
02:52:09,204 --> 02:52:11,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have a list of like generally what these thresholds are?

1410
02:52:11,845 --> 02:52:16,627
[SPEAKER_15]: In a community this size, usually 50 or a hundred.

1411
02:52:16,647 --> 02:52:17,707
[SPEAKER_06]: 50 or a hundred.

1412
02:52:17,927 --> 02:52:18,187
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1413
02:52:18,247 --> 02:52:19,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1414
02:52:19,148 --> 02:52:21,849
[SPEAKER_15]: You're trying, you want it to be real.

1415
02:52:23,810 --> 02:52:30,612
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, you don't want it to be about, you know, some small piece of sidewalk.

1416
02:52:31,053 --> 02:52:31,913
[SPEAKER_15]: It's gotta be a real thing.

1417
02:52:32,377 --> 02:52:33,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we'll hear both.

1418
02:52:33,718 --> 02:52:35,839
[SPEAKER_06]: We hear from people on one.

1419
02:52:35,939 --> 02:52:38,601
[SPEAKER_06]: No signatures needed in a single paper right now.

1420
02:52:38,621 --> 02:52:42,864
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think this raises the level of a hearing and an action and a time period.

1421
02:52:43,404 --> 02:52:44,184
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1422
02:52:44,345 --> 02:52:46,886
[SPEAKER_15]: That's to make sure it happens.

1423
02:52:47,126 --> 02:52:48,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

1424
02:52:48,447 --> 02:52:48,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1425
02:52:48,727 --> 02:52:49,228
[SPEAKER_06]: So OK.

1426
02:52:49,248 --> 02:52:51,709
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's generally 50 to 100 in a community of this size?

1427
02:52:52,029 --> 02:52:52,350
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1428
02:52:52,630 --> 02:52:52,870
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

1429
02:52:53,190 --> 02:52:53,590
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1430
02:52:55,277 --> 02:52:56,538
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Capello.

1431
02:52:56,558 --> 02:53:02,420
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you to the point that we have public participation, but I'm hearing when it comes to a petition.

1432
02:53:03,161 --> 02:53:04,961
[SPEAKER_20]: Then it has to be heard on the floor, correct?

1433
02:53:05,162 --> 02:53:05,822
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, right.

1434
02:53:05,862 --> 02:53:07,222
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's there's discussion.

1435
02:53:07,683 --> 02:53:10,784
[SPEAKER_20]: Our public participation can't can't be discussion.

1436
02:53:11,344 --> 02:53:13,945
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just Listened and then walk away.

1437
02:53:14,426 --> 02:53:19,308
[SPEAKER_20]: So I see this as as as one of the reasons why I agree with this.

1438
02:53:19,388 --> 02:53:20,048
[SPEAKER_20]: I also agree with 25.

1439
02:53:20,088 --> 02:53:21,949
[SPEAKER_20]: I would agree 50, maybe 50 people.

1440
02:53:24,395 --> 02:53:25,736
[SPEAKER_20]: would be a more truer number.

1441
02:53:25,776 --> 02:53:28,317
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that gives you a new.

1442
02:53:28,657 --> 02:53:30,318
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I think I would do that.

1443
02:53:30,378 --> 02:53:33,899
[SPEAKER_20]: But to eliminate this, I think would be a huge disservice.

1444
02:53:34,700 --> 02:53:40,002
[SPEAKER_09]: Just just to say I we do have discussion after public comment.

1445
02:53:40,022 --> 02:53:41,263
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just that it's not required.

1446
02:53:41,783 --> 02:53:45,685
[SPEAKER_09]: But we do have we do often have discussion after public comment.

1447
02:53:47,278 --> 02:53:50,425
[SPEAKER_09]: but I do note that the difference in the requirement.

1448
02:53:51,286 --> 02:53:54,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have any follow-up questions for the call-in center?

1449
02:53:57,167 --> 02:54:15,114
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, I believe the comments that have been used, I want to make sure that with this process, it's made to have an issue that's been put forth by, let's say, 50 signatures that they would be heard by this council.

1450
02:54:15,494 --> 02:54:18,755
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, at that time, when it comes to this point,

1451
02:54:20,100 --> 02:54:26,745
[SPEAKER_20]: this wouldn't be something that if the chair didn't feel comfortable with it, they would question the motion and move forward.

1452
02:54:27,045 --> 02:54:28,826
[SPEAKER_20]: This would be something that had to be heard, correct?

1453
02:54:29,066 --> 02:54:29,306
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1454
02:54:29,387 --> 02:54:33,369
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so I think that's the difference with what my colleagues are saying.

1455
02:54:33,409 --> 02:54:38,373
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, you signed a petition to guarantee that you get a private counsel.

1456
02:54:38,713 --> 02:54:38,913
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.

1457
02:54:38,933 --> 02:54:43,674
[SPEAKER_20]: So that again, so again, what I'm hearing is that eliminate this because we don't we do it.

1458
02:54:44,035 --> 02:54:44,795
[SPEAKER_20]: No, it's not true.

1459
02:54:45,315 --> 02:54:59,899
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a this is a an avenue that if residents don't feel that they being heard, that they get the 50 somewhat signatures, they they present it to the clerk, they bring it to the podium, and then they have to be heard with a discussion.

1460
02:55:00,239 --> 02:55:01,900
[SPEAKER_20]: And then they don't have to agree with it.

1461
02:55:02,080 --> 02:55:03,000
[SPEAKER_20]: But then it has to be

1462
02:55:03,440 --> 02:55:04,341
[SPEAKER_20]: It has to be heard.

1463
02:55:04,421 --> 02:55:10,906
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, like I said, I think it's important that this is an avenue that needs to be left in this process.

1464
02:55:10,946 --> 02:55:14,549
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that's why all other communities have this in place.

1465
02:55:14,949 --> 02:55:21,374
[SPEAKER_20]: It's because, again, it's an avenue for our residents to be heard when they think they're not being listened to.

1466
02:55:21,914 --> 02:55:22,675
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, thank you.

1467
02:55:24,071 --> 02:55:25,793
[SPEAKER_09]: I had two follow-up questions.

1468
02:55:26,393 --> 02:55:35,099
[SPEAKER_09]: The first one being, and we'll get a hint of this in the school committee member comments, is that, is this standard for school committees?

1469
02:55:35,399 --> 02:55:44,986
[SPEAKER_09]: This is something that I think school committee members have noted that their colleagues are not familiar with this in the charter provision.

1470
02:55:45,086 --> 02:55:47,107
[SPEAKER_15]: It usually does include the school committee.

1471
02:55:49,163 --> 02:56:05,537
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess my follow up is all I guess not a follow up on that but my more general question, then is that say that a resident files a free one of these free petitions, and that you know that petition, really.

1472
02:56:06,588 --> 02:56:15,955
[SPEAKER_09]: targets a member of, let's not even say an elected official, but a member of the public or a member of the city staff, city or school staff, I guess.

1473
02:56:16,455 --> 02:56:19,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that something that would be allowed with this vehicle?

1474
02:56:19,257 --> 02:56:25,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Because my worry then is that it's posted publicly throughout the city that you have this free petition that's attacking someone personally.

1475
02:56:25,982 --> 02:56:30,485
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it says you're requesting that the council take some kind of action.

1476
02:56:30,746 --> 02:56:32,987
[SPEAKER_09]: But it would still be posted with the meeting notice.

1477
02:56:33,568 --> 02:56:33,748
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1478
02:56:34,323 --> 02:56:36,824
[SPEAKER_09]: So the public would still see a personal attack.

1479
02:56:39,226 --> 02:56:48,271
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm trying to think of if you're requesting that the city take action, are you saying, go ahead, Frank.

1480
02:56:48,331 --> 02:57:00,678
[SPEAKER_19]: If it in any way relates to a personnel matter, there are certain laws already in place that would restrict the ability to have that presented in a public forum.

1481
02:57:01,598 --> 02:57:03,179
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would say that's not,

1482
02:57:04,729 --> 02:57:08,692
[SPEAKER_19]: an item for which this free petition would be appropriate.

1483
02:57:08,752 --> 02:57:22,163
[SPEAKER_19]: I think if you were to get a complaint that's more of a, I would say an HR issue, then it should be reviewed by your city solicitor before it's acted upon.

1484
02:57:22,663 --> 02:57:22,984
[SPEAKER_09]: I see.

1485
02:57:23,424 --> 02:57:25,626
[SPEAKER_09]: And I, there's a followup from President Behrs.

1486
02:57:25,766 --> 02:57:28,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, just a hypothetical.

1487
02:57:29,963 --> 02:57:40,611
[SPEAKER_06]: if the, what if someone put a petition in that said, we believe that the council, we don't like the mayor, the mayor's doing a bad job, so we believe the council should use its authority under the charter to remove the mayor.

1488
02:57:42,432 --> 02:57:59,325
[SPEAKER_06]: How, I guess the question is who, we're coming back to the determination of if there are some things that this can apply to and some things that it can't apply to, you know, that should probably be listed in the charter so that residents don't think that an arbitrary decision is being made based on their specific petition, but that there's actually a specific

1489
02:58:00,444 --> 02:58:07,648
[SPEAKER_06]: category of exemptions and that's already exists here in the ineligible provisions for the other citizen initiative recommendations.

1490
02:58:07,708 --> 02:58:26,077
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying like, if we're saying that there are certain personnel related things that you couldn't file a free petition for, then what's the list of things that this applies to and doesn't apply to because otherwise to be quite frank as the chair, I'm gonna get blamed either by the public or by members of this council for picking and choosing.

1491
02:58:27,731 --> 02:58:32,576
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I guess my response to that would be that you wouldn't be picking and choosing.

1492
02:58:32,636 --> 02:58:35,899
[SPEAKER_19]: You'd be getting guidance from your law department.

1493
02:58:36,800 --> 02:58:37,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1494
02:58:38,362 --> 02:58:41,044
[SPEAKER_06]: So the law department would determine what's eligible and ineligible?

1495
02:58:41,064 --> 02:58:49,313
[SPEAKER_19]: The law department would give you a legal opinion that states, for the following reasons, this is or is not a proper subject for a public hearing.

1496
02:58:49,765 --> 02:58:57,911
[SPEAKER_06]: And where would residents be able to point to, or where would I be able to point residents to say, here's what a proper subject is or isn't for a public hearing?

1497
02:58:59,492 --> 02:59:00,813
[SPEAKER_19]: You could share the legal opinion.

1498
02:59:01,593 --> 02:59:07,657
[SPEAKER_06]: I could share the legal opinion, but then they're just going to say the legal opinion is biased or the chair wrote a biased opinion with the legal department.

1499
02:59:08,157 --> 02:59:18,204
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying there has to be a way that we can point residents to a clear set of conditions that doesn't end up pointing back to my free speech has been quashed, you know, arguments, which we hear all the time.

1500
02:59:19,618 --> 02:59:25,582
[SPEAKER_19]: complain about the way somebody directed plowing at the last snowstorm.

1501
02:59:25,622 --> 02:59:39,491
[SPEAKER_19]: That's different than saying that somebody is a bad employee, and they throw a blade, and they have a history of not living within the requirements of their job.

1502
02:59:40,992 --> 02:59:45,535
[SPEAKER_19]: The latter would be an HR matter, whereas the former could be a subject

1503
02:59:51,418 --> 02:59:51,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1504
02:59:51,958 --> 02:59:55,700
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hear I just want to be clear here that this isn't actually free petition.

1505
02:59:55,720 --> 03:00:03,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Because even if someone submits the signatures, then the law department gets to look through all of the general laws and decide, well, it doesn't actually apply.

1506
03:00:03,825 --> 03:00:13,730
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess my other point is, are we actually then going to be sending every single one of these to the law department to make a determination who makes that choice?

1507
03:00:13,750 --> 03:00:18,113
[SPEAKER_15]: I just have to say, I've

1508
03:00:19,070 --> 03:00:20,952
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been doing this kind of work for 40 years.

1509
03:00:22,813 --> 03:00:24,275
[SPEAKER_15]: This doesn't happen that often.

1510
03:00:25,736 --> 03:00:34,403
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you would be surprised at the level of misrepresentations of people's character that's happened based on decisions like this recently here in the city.

1511
03:00:34,684 --> 03:00:38,187
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I mean, in terms of in terms of sort of a statewide picture.

1512
03:00:40,693 --> 03:00:40,933
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

1513
03:00:41,254 --> 03:00:44,495
[SPEAKER_15]: I've answered questions about this section for decades.

1514
03:00:44,875 --> 03:00:46,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1515
03:00:46,096 --> 03:00:59,583
[SPEAKER_06]: We have had, I could probably point to 10 to 15 instances in the last 24 months where the questions that I'm asking have been raised over and over again to make arguments that procedural decisions were actually political or personal decisions.

1516
03:01:00,720 --> 03:01:10,166
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'm asking, what is an unbiased resource that we could point to in this section to make sure that accusations can't be hurled?

1517
03:01:10,326 --> 03:01:19,471
[SPEAKER_15]: I would just propose that you do some umbrella statement, unless constrained by the general law.

1518
03:01:19,771 --> 03:01:20,051
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

1519
03:01:20,512 --> 03:01:27,236
[SPEAKER_06]: So that these shall all be reviewed by the law department, and these will be allowed if they're not constrained by the general law, something like that.

1520
03:01:27,716 --> 03:01:27,796
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

1521
03:01:28,286 --> 03:01:30,427
[SPEAKER_09]: I do have a follow-up on all of that, though.

1522
03:01:30,747 --> 03:01:45,432
[SPEAKER_09]: How does this interact with the Supreme Judicial Court ruling that basically, it's, I mean, super expansive about public speech in the forum like this, basically just saying, I mean, the line is death threats, essentially, and hateful speech.

1523
03:01:45,452 --> 03:01:46,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Which has happened, by the way.

1524
03:01:46,673 --> 03:01:46,853
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1525
03:01:47,193 --> 03:01:47,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Which has happened.

1526
03:01:47,833 --> 03:01:48,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, yeah, which has happened.

1527
03:01:48,894 --> 03:01:51,355
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, well, this is supposed to happen within this box.

1528
03:01:51,375 --> 03:01:52,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry?

1529
03:01:52,875 --> 03:01:53,615
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't hear that.

1530
03:01:53,635 --> 03:01:55,436
[SPEAKER_15]: This is supposed to happen within this box.

1531
03:01:56,316 --> 03:01:57,597
[SPEAKER_15]: This is what governs.

1532
03:02:00,907 --> 03:02:05,491
[SPEAKER_15]: But I mean, can you point to me the line that you're pointing to?

1533
03:02:16,593 --> 03:02:27,702
[SPEAKER_09]: But the section doesn't say anything about being able to review free petitions or the Supreme Court judicial court ruling on free speech and in public forums.

1534
03:02:27,783 --> 03:02:31,466
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate the ruling on free speech.

1535
03:02:31,506 --> 03:02:40,894
[SPEAKER_15]: What I'm trying to say is this is a set of directions for a show of actions to take place within these boundaries set by the Section 81.

1536
03:02:42,938 --> 03:02:43,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, yeah.

1537
03:02:43,578 --> 03:02:45,459
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I think we're just talking past each other.

1538
03:02:45,499 --> 03:02:47,720
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not even necessarily opposed to the free petition.

1539
03:02:47,760 --> 03:02:52,703
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to be able to sort out the legal logistics and hypotheticals that may come up.

1540
03:02:53,123 --> 03:03:00,627
[SPEAKER_19]: I just... If you added the language that just proposed, that would allow you to, again, have

1541
03:03:02,141 --> 03:03:11,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we then be sued for limiting someone's free speech in a public forum?

1542
03:03:12,348 --> 03:03:22,296
[SPEAKER_19]: A lot of common opinion should be telling you, yes, this is appropriate for public hearing or this is not appropriate for public hearing.

1543
03:03:23,277 --> 03:03:36,906
[SPEAKER_09]: But it seems like there are contradictory, and it could be wrong, but it seems like there are contradictory state laws in the state constitution about what is okay for free speech and what's okay for complaining about HR and everything.

1544
03:03:37,226 --> 03:03:39,708
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it could be that the state law is unconstitutional too.

1545
03:03:40,709 --> 03:03:42,410
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I think that's a pop out paper.

1546
03:03:43,130 --> 03:03:45,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Has this been reviewed since the Shurtleff decision?

1547
03:03:47,758 --> 03:03:57,404
[SPEAKER_06]: since the Supreme Court decision around Shurtleff and creating public spaces, and since the Supreme Judicial Court's determination, has this template language been reviewed?

1548
03:03:57,424 --> 03:04:05,909
[SPEAKER_19]: I think, again, that's where your law department really is.

1549
03:04:05,929 --> 03:04:07,209
[SPEAKER_19]: It also comes into play.

1550
03:04:08,070 --> 03:04:09,351
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have one right now.

1551
03:04:09,431 --> 03:04:16,315
[SPEAKER_19]: That person, that firm, whatever, should be giving you good guidance as to what you can and cannot do.

1552
03:04:17,485 --> 03:04:36,090
[SPEAKER_06]: their guidance on issues of similar, and this is the reason why I think we're belaboring the point, their guidance on similar topics has been essentially, if you create a public forum, so for example, if you allow groups to fly, individual private groups to fly a flag on City Hall, you have to allow anyone to fly any flag.

1553
03:04:37,080 --> 03:04:39,782
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess the question is, what is the interface here?

1554
03:04:39,822 --> 03:04:58,277
[SPEAKER_06]: If we create this public forum and we're saying right now that the law says, well, you can't discuss personal attacks or personnel matters or this X, Y, and Z, but another law and a Supreme Court decision says, if you're restricted at all, you're limiting the first amendment, where does that line get drawn?

1555
03:04:58,458 --> 03:05:03,282
[SPEAKER_06]: And our council seems to be, the council we have right now seems to be leaning towards, there's no limit.

1556
03:05:04,282 --> 03:05:04,463
[SPEAKER_06]: So,

1557
03:05:06,068 --> 03:05:07,730
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just where my question comes from.

1558
03:05:07,850 --> 03:05:20,962
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I think you look at every case on its own merits, and if that's the direction you get from your law department, then that's their guidance, and that's what you should rely on.

1559
03:05:21,042 --> 03:05:26,067
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll take a second, I think.

1560
03:05:27,508 --> 03:05:27,748
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1561
03:05:28,149 --> 03:05:28,289
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1562
03:05:28,309 --> 03:05:30,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Collins, I know you've been waiting a long time.

1563
03:05:32,674 --> 03:05:33,715
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Chair Seng.

1564
03:05:33,735 --> 03:05:36,257
[SPEAKER_31]: I really appreciate this discussion.

1565
03:05:36,437 --> 03:05:54,072
[SPEAKER_31]: I appreciate that this motion came out of a place of wanting to have us ever be improving avenues for participation in our city bodies, and I certainly appreciate the clarified conversation that we're having with the Collins Center about it.

1566
03:05:55,273 --> 03:05:58,576
[SPEAKER_31]: I am going to make a motion to strike this section, and I'll explain why.

1567
03:05:58,596 --> 03:06:00,677
[SPEAKER_31]: I think what's important

1568
03:06:01,918 --> 03:06:29,335
[SPEAKER_31]: whether it's in our council rules or in the charter or in the school committee rules, though I cannot speak to those, is... I think what's important is improving participation meaningfully and balancing that meaningful participation with guarding the council against opportunities to filibuster, because having a democratic process for the city council and other elected bodies has to mean also letting the council be a workplace so that councilors can do the work that they were democratically elected

1569
03:06:30,015 --> 03:06:30,456
[SPEAKER_31]: to do.

1570
03:06:31,437 --> 03:06:41,326
[SPEAKER_31]: I think the really critical context here is that this would not be the creation of a new sole opportunity for public participation, opportunity to be heard in front of the City Council.

1571
03:06:41,546 --> 03:06:45,670
[SPEAKER_31]: Opportunities for public participation do exist on our bodies.

1572
03:06:45,690 --> 03:06:53,597
[SPEAKER_31]: On the City Council, with a particularly low barrier to entry, we do have more lenient public participation policies than most councils in the state, is my understanding.

1573
03:06:54,458 --> 03:07:00,180
[SPEAKER_31]: And sometimes the council takes rapid and direct action on matters that are brought up during public participation, and sometimes it doesn't.

1574
03:07:01,100 --> 03:07:07,962
[SPEAKER_31]: But I think that as a representative democracy and not as a direct democracy, that is just how it is.

1575
03:07:08,702 --> 03:07:17,365
[SPEAKER_31]: And my litmus test for this section is, does this meaningfully expand public participation more than what we already have to offer residents?

1576
03:07:18,665 --> 03:07:24,709
[SPEAKER_31]: without having that adverse side effect of limiting the council's ability to do the work that we are elected to do, and I'm not sure that it would.

1577
03:07:25,310 --> 03:07:39,138
[SPEAKER_31]: I think that it would be more encumbering than it would meaningfully expand participation, especially given that Articles 8.3 and 8.4 are still on the table, and those are much more specific, much more constrained, and I think a more actionable way to do what this section is getting at.

1578
03:07:41,119 --> 03:07:44,842
[SPEAKER_31]: So that's my rationale, and I am making the motion to strike this section.

1579
03:07:44,962 --> 03:07:45,182
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1580
03:07:48,026 --> 03:07:49,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, yeah.

1581
03:07:50,469 --> 03:07:50,950
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, I know.

1582
03:07:51,491 --> 03:07:55,235
[SPEAKER_20]: I know it's coming in and out with different people but you didn't hear the motion.

1583
03:07:55,435 --> 03:07:57,318
[SPEAKER_20]: The motion is to strike.

1584
03:07:57,538 --> 03:07:58,519
[SPEAKER_09]: For what reason?

1585
03:07:58,679 --> 03:07:59,280
[SPEAKER_09]: I couldn't hear it.

1586
03:07:59,781 --> 03:08:02,724
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to put words in the vice president's mouth.

1587
03:08:02,805 --> 03:08:03,806
[SPEAKER_30]: I can repeat if needed.

1588
03:08:05,784 --> 03:08:06,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, yeah.

1589
03:08:06,244 --> 03:08:08,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you repeat the rationale?

1590
03:08:08,886 --> 03:08:10,127
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it's their fault.

1591
03:08:10,187 --> 03:08:11,908
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that we're having issues with the Zoom.

1592
03:08:12,328 --> 03:08:12,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

1593
03:08:12,548 --> 03:08:13,969
[SPEAKER_06]: I could ask to turn up the Zoom audio more.

1594
03:08:14,850 --> 03:08:18,352
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been able to follow along with the captions relatively well, but I'll ask Sarah to turn up the Zoom.

1595
03:08:18,372 --> 03:08:18,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1596
03:08:18,712 --> 03:08:19,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1597
03:08:19,072 --> 03:08:21,714
[SPEAKER_30]: Just in the meantime- They're saying, should I repeat myself?

1598
03:08:22,314 --> 03:08:22,694
[SPEAKER_09]: That's good.

1599
03:08:22,754 --> 03:08:23,555
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah, that's good.

1600
03:08:23,615 --> 03:08:23,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1601
03:08:23,835 --> 03:08:26,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you just summarize what you said?

1602
03:08:28,138 --> 03:08:28,418
[SPEAKER_31]: Sure.

1603
03:08:28,438 --> 03:08:28,938
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1604
03:08:31,832 --> 03:08:40,799
[SPEAKER_31]: I think what's important is improving participation meaningfully and balancing participation with guarding against the council against opportunities to filibuster.

1605
03:08:40,819 --> 03:08:51,327
[SPEAKER_31]: To me, having a democratic process for the city council has to mean also letting the council be a workplace so that the councillors can do the work that we were democratically elected to do.

1606
03:08:52,648 --> 03:09:03,657
[SPEAKER_31]: I think what's important context here is that opportunities for public participation already exist on this council with, or in our elected bodies, especially on the council with a very low barrier to entry.

1607
03:09:04,497 --> 03:09:08,661
[SPEAKER_31]: On the city council we have more lenient public participation policies than most councils in the state.

1608
03:09:09,681 --> 03:09:14,846
[SPEAKER_31]: Sometimes the council takes rapid and direct action on matters that are brought up during public participation and sometimes it doesn't.

1609
03:09:16,587 --> 03:09:22,510
[SPEAKER_31]: But as a representative democracy and not a direct democracy, that is just the case, that is how it is.

1610
03:09:23,471 --> 03:09:29,874
[SPEAKER_31]: My litmus test for this section is, will this be more expanding of avenues for public participation, meaningful participation?

1611
03:09:30,935 --> 03:09:31,555
[SPEAKER_31]: Then it will

1612
03:09:32,976 --> 03:09:34,697
[SPEAKER_31]: then it will limit our ability to do our jobs.

1613
03:09:35,718 --> 03:09:47,186
[SPEAKER_31]: And I believe that this will be more encumbering than it will meaningfully expand public participation, especially given that Articles 8-3 and 8-4 are still on the table, and I think that they are more specific and more actionable in a good way.

1614
03:09:48,066 --> 03:09:51,569
[SPEAKER_31]: So that is my rationale for the motion to strike Article 8-1.

1615
03:09:51,649 --> 03:09:56,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1616
03:09:57,713 --> 03:10:00,755
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw Councilor Lazaro, Leving, and then Scarpelli.

1617
03:10:02,657 --> 03:10:03,017
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1618
03:10:04,158 --> 03:10:10,123
[SPEAKER_26]: I've just been reading some of our neighboring cities' websites about their petitions they have online.

1619
03:10:10,163 --> 03:10:16,868
[SPEAKER_26]: They have access to setting up with a petition, a petition scheme in Cambridge.

1620
03:10:16,948 --> 03:10:18,549
[SPEAKER_26]: You have to have 500 signatures.

1621
03:10:21,031 --> 03:10:22,492
[SPEAKER_26]: It's very explicit.

1622
03:10:22,752 --> 03:10:24,313
[SPEAKER_26]: They're a bigger city than us, obviously.

1623
03:10:24,373 --> 03:10:26,915
[SPEAKER_26]: But they also have an extremely robust city hall.

1624
03:10:29,633 --> 03:10:30,493
[SPEAKER_26]: everybody there.

1625
03:10:30,593 --> 03:10:32,874
[SPEAKER_26]: It's much, much, much bigger.

1626
03:10:35,476 --> 03:10:47,681
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that we in Medford have policies that are outliers for the way that we operate with regard to our city council meetings.

1627
03:10:49,782 --> 03:10:52,583
[SPEAKER_26]: And if we are trying to come in line,

1628
03:10:53,325 --> 03:10:59,589
[SPEAKER_26]: with the way that other cities operate, this is not, you guys, I'm not like accusing you of anything.

1629
03:10:59,609 --> 03:11:01,670
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't mean to point myself in your direction.

1630
03:11:02,091 --> 03:11:05,493
[SPEAKER_26]: If we're gonna align ourselves with other cities, we need to align ourselves with other cities.

1631
03:11:05,973 --> 03:11:09,015
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think that will mean making a lot of changes to our rules.

1632
03:11:09,455 --> 03:11:11,456
[SPEAKER_26]: So if we wanted to do that, we should do that.

1633
03:11:11,576 --> 03:11:18,321
[SPEAKER_26]: But if we want to keep our public participation the way that it is now, then I don't think that it makes sense to also have a,

1634
03:11:21,224 --> 03:11:21,825
[SPEAKER_26]: free petition.

1635
03:11:21,985 --> 03:11:27,409
[SPEAKER_26]: If we wanted to do a free petition like other cities do, then we should cut out a lot of our public participation opportunities.

1636
03:11:27,829 --> 03:11:32,372
[SPEAKER_26]: If we want to keep our public participation opportunities the way they are now, I think that takes the place of the free petition.

1637
03:11:33,597 --> 03:11:34,898
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't think it makes sense to have both.

1638
03:11:36,198 --> 03:11:40,140
[SPEAKER_26]: Somerville has much smaller threshold for free petition.

1639
03:11:40,180 --> 03:11:42,061
[SPEAKER_26]: They have, I think their numbers are very low.

1640
03:11:42,101 --> 03:11:45,362
[SPEAKER_26]: I saw one that was like 22 signatures and it still got on there.

1641
03:11:45,382 --> 03:11:49,804
[SPEAKER_26]: I think it was something that was interesting to probably the city council as it stood at that time.

1642
03:11:50,164 --> 03:11:52,285
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that's pretty similar to how we operate now.

1643
03:11:52,305 --> 03:12:02,370
[SPEAKER_26]: I think a lot of what ends up happening in Medford is just because we had such a short charter, we just ended up doing a lot of the stuff that we'll just be putting into the charter

1644
03:12:03,387 --> 03:12:05,049
[SPEAKER_26]: here, which is great.

1645
03:12:05,169 --> 03:12:08,592
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, we should have it in a charter, it should be in a document that we follow.

1646
03:12:08,632 --> 03:12:10,974
[SPEAKER_26]: We shouldn't just be like making it up as we go along.

1647
03:12:11,514 --> 03:12:19,021
[SPEAKER_26]: We should have something to follow along so that when the next people come in, they have something that they can, you know, guide them.

1648
03:12:20,823 --> 03:12:25,147
[SPEAKER_26]: All of that being said, what I find frustrating with these conversations is that

1649
03:12:26,776 --> 03:12:32,318
[SPEAKER_26]: Anybody can pick and choose the things about Medford that are like special about Medford that make us different.

1650
03:12:32,838 --> 03:12:36,539
[SPEAKER_26]: Or we can say we're not Cambridge, we're Medford, we're different and special.

1651
03:12:36,759 --> 03:12:45,662
[SPEAKER_26]: Or we can say, well, we have to be like other cities or we have to be, you know, another thing that I saw was like the town of Lincoln, they have two

1652
03:12:46,522 --> 03:12:47,462
[SPEAKER_26]: town meetings a year.

1653
03:12:47,482 --> 03:12:52,845
[SPEAKER_26]: So of course they need free petitions because otherwise, like if you miss your chance, you don't get to have your thing brought up.

1654
03:12:53,125 --> 03:12:56,526
[SPEAKER_26]: It's like, that's entire town meeting is different than this.

1655
03:12:57,847 --> 03:13:04,610
[SPEAKER_26]: Of course, but it's, it's a great it may be, but some of this language may be boilerplate but it's not, it's just not.

1656
03:13:05,230 --> 03:13:27,091
[SPEAKER_26]: not responsive to what right it's not maybe responsive to what we're looking for but it doesn't mean that we're not um taking the the uh concerns of our residents and responding to them and uh hopefully hearing what our residents need and want and trying to make those things happen um

1657
03:13:28,258 --> 03:13:46,078
[SPEAKER_26]: If we do these things or don't do these things, I hope that everybody understands to the to the goal of being able to carry out the desires of the people that have elected us to perform these roles.

1658
03:13:47,980 --> 03:13:48,080
[SPEAKER_26]: So,

1659
03:13:51,607 --> 03:13:52,950
[SPEAKER_26]: are trying to figure out the best way to do it.

1660
03:13:53,571 --> 03:13:55,215
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't think 500 is a good threshold.

1661
03:13:55,736 --> 03:13:56,898
[SPEAKER_26]: I also don't think 25 is.

1662
03:13:56,938 --> 03:13:58,361
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that would be really difficult.

1663
03:14:02,846 --> 03:14:12,651
[SPEAKER_09]: I do see hands from a lot of people right now, but I do want to make sure that the other elected officials who would be affected by this petition get their comments read too.

1664
03:14:13,491 --> 03:14:19,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice Chair Graham says, the inclusion of free petitions in section 8-1 presents a further challenge.

1665
03:14:19,874 --> 03:14:22,755
[SPEAKER_09]: The school committee and I personally believe in the importance of public input.

1666
03:14:23,055 --> 03:14:29,818
[SPEAKER_09]: However, the ability to obstruct the functioning of school community via free petitions would undermine the efficiency and effectiveness of the educational process.

1667
03:14:30,498 --> 03:14:44,813
[SPEAKER_09]: Our responsibility to Medford's children requires us to make timely thoughtful decisions about budgets policies and educational initiatives, the introduction of national style politics and special interest group influence could push priorities that don't align with immediate needs of our students.

1668
03:14:45,473 --> 03:14:49,915
[SPEAKER_09]: National politics aside, we are already seeing escalating rhetoric here in Medford that's dangerous.

1669
03:14:50,295 --> 03:14:57,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Criticism of our elected officials is the bedrock of democracy, but personal attacks and threats are being normalized here in a way that is very concerning.

1670
03:14:58,039 --> 03:15:11,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Adding this additional and escalated pathway to air disagreements will only escalate the rhetoric, and I fear that continuing to allow our discourse to escalate rather than allowing duly elected officials to do their work could lead to a physically dangerous situation.

1671
03:15:12,346 --> 03:15:14,227
[SPEAKER_09]: We should take this risk very seriously.

1672
03:15:14,900 --> 03:15:30,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Additionally, this dynamic could discourage qualified individuals from running for the school committee, as the constant interference from petitions would make it harder for those willing to serve with the focus on student needs to feel and to feel supported in the role.

1673
03:15:30,867 --> 03:15:38,311
[SPEAKER_09]: The school committee needs to ensure that our focus remains on our students, and free petitions should not be allowed to distract from that critical goal.

1674
03:15:40,535 --> 03:15:41,837
[SPEAKER_09]: from member Russo.

1675
03:15:42,797 --> 03:15:50,984
[SPEAKER_09]: His recommendation is to strike the whole section, and his rationale is that he said, I do not believe the section should be included at all.

1676
03:15:51,504 --> 03:15:54,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Elections occur every two years, which is a relatively short period.

1677
03:15:54,687 --> 03:16:01,112
[SPEAKER_09]: The thresholds set here are low enough to potentially trap the school committee in a continuous cycle of responding to groups acting in bad faith.

1678
03:16:01,854 --> 03:16:03,775
[SPEAKER_09]: aiming to disrupt the committee's work.

1679
03:16:04,296 --> 03:16:12,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Additionally, there is no provision to halt a petition that is illegal or places the district in legal jeopardy, such as the one that targets district employees or students.

1680
03:16:13,723 --> 03:16:16,385
[SPEAKER_09]: So those are the written comments I received.

1681
03:16:17,085 --> 03:16:20,007
[SPEAKER_09]: I know Councilor Lemming has been waiting a long time, and then Councilor Spadafore.

1682
03:16:27,390 --> 03:16:48,094
[SPEAKER_22]: My main thing with this is I don't see the material benefit of having this, given that we already have public participation, what I've seen happen in those public participations, where they often do take the form of a discussion regardless.

1683
03:16:48,334 --> 03:16:55,275
[SPEAKER_22]: One thing that's on my mind with this and the back and forth about the potential legal ramifications

1684
03:16:57,652 --> 03:17:01,134
[SPEAKER_22]: really do a whole lot to enforce my confidence in this measure.

1685
03:17:03,275 --> 03:17:18,023
[SPEAKER_22]: But one thing that I dislike is just the idea that having a free petition in their section in there could make it unclear to residents that they're perfectly free to come to a city council meeting anyway without a free petition and just say what they like.

1686
03:17:20,610 --> 03:17:23,051
[SPEAKER_22]: So there's that.

1687
03:17:23,211 --> 03:17:32,375
[SPEAKER_22]: I do see a way that, especially with the 25 signatures, I do see plenty of opportunity to abuse this.

1688
03:17:32,455 --> 03:17:38,797
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think from what I've heard, this whole subcommittee is generally in favor of at least raising that threshold.

1689
03:17:42,177 --> 03:17:53,487
[SPEAKER_22]: Just just a general comment just a little bit more broadly than this like I do notice that, you know, when making different arguments for and against different parts that go into this charter.

1690
03:17:55,189 --> 03:17:57,051
[SPEAKER_22]: People have like.

1691
03:17:59,114 --> 03:18:10,202
[SPEAKER_22]: I think people have been pretty selective about when they use public support for these different things in their favor and when they just want to ignore public support in favor of their own opinions or experiences.

1692
03:18:10,282 --> 03:18:24,492
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, you know, I've heard folks from the Charter Study Committee say that they really want a certain part of the charter to pass or be changed because public feedback or comment supports that.

1693
03:18:24,532 --> 03:18:25,893
[SPEAKER_22]: But then there's other parts where

1694
03:18:27,987 --> 03:18:36,810
[SPEAKER_22]: If opinions happen to disagree with the public feedback that they've gotten, then you try to discount that.

1695
03:18:36,850 --> 03:18:48,713
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think that if we're going to have this argument, sorry, have these debates, then we should at least be consistent with how we treat survey data, for instance.

1696
03:18:51,354 --> 03:18:51,594
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1697
03:18:52,434 --> 03:18:53,635
[SPEAKER_22]: And otherwise, I think that

1698
03:18:55,673 --> 03:19:00,936
[SPEAKER_22]: This particular section, again, I just don't see a whole lot of material benefit on it.

1699
03:19:00,976 --> 03:19:04,458
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm still open to having that be explained to me.

1700
03:19:04,479 --> 03:19:09,341
[SPEAKER_22]: But yeah, no, that's my take on it.

1701
03:19:10,922 --> 03:19:11,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarbone.

1702
03:19:12,523 --> 03:19:13,304
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

1703
03:19:16,886 --> 03:19:22,870
[SPEAKER_20]: Listened to my colleagues and colleagues in the school committee and we're elected officials.

1704
03:19:24,398 --> 03:19:26,920
[SPEAKER_20]: people are gonna come to that podium, they're not gonna be happy with us.

1705
03:19:27,701 --> 03:19:31,944
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what we ran for.

1706
03:19:32,425 --> 03:19:33,526
[SPEAKER_20]: We have to understand that.

1707
03:19:34,467 --> 03:19:38,230
[SPEAKER_20]: Not everybody's gonna come up and say what you wanna hear or they're gonna believe in what you have to say.

1708
03:19:38,650 --> 03:19:39,251
[SPEAKER_20]: I've dealt with it.

1709
03:19:40,312 --> 03:19:50,380
[SPEAKER_20]: I've been sitting and doing what we've been doing here for the last few months and putting what my thoughts and processes are and then being thrown back and spit back in my face, but you have to take it.

1710
03:19:51,541 --> 03:19:52,422
[SPEAKER_20]: That's part of the job.

1711
03:19:54,463 --> 03:19:56,444
[SPEAKER_20]: That's not limiting what we're trying to do.

1712
03:19:56,784 --> 03:19:58,125
[SPEAKER_20]: It's an open forum.

1713
03:19:58,145 --> 03:19:59,245
[SPEAKER_20]: This is what government's about.

1714
03:19:59,745 --> 03:20:03,627
[SPEAKER_20]: We talk about democracy and eliminating this for the sake of democracy.

1715
03:20:05,728 --> 03:20:06,228
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't get it.

1716
03:20:06,268 --> 03:20:20,735
[SPEAKER_20]: So this, we keep saying we have public participation, we have public participation, but the experts with 40 years experience have expressed and shown us the difference.

1717
03:20:23,539 --> 03:20:32,549
[SPEAKER_20]: that this doesn't happen often, but when it does, it's an avenue for our residents to come forward and have that ability to come forward through democracy.

1718
03:20:35,052 --> 03:20:38,576
[SPEAKER_20]: We talk about, you know, we haven't made these changes.

1719
03:20:38,616 --> 03:20:39,457
[SPEAKER_20]: We made no changes.

1720
03:20:40,117 --> 03:20:44,923
[SPEAKER_20]: This council voted to have that open forum open four times a month to two.

1721
03:20:46,445 --> 03:20:53,269
[SPEAKER_20]: This council changed the process that we have public participation at the end of the agenda and people really can't talk.

1722
03:20:53,309 --> 03:20:56,772
[SPEAKER_20]: Whatever my fellow council say, it's not supposed to be debatable.

1723
03:20:58,693 --> 03:21:01,495
[SPEAKER_20]: Then we talk about a time limit on when people can speak.

1724
03:21:02,783 --> 03:21:08,125
[SPEAKER_20]: So don't give me the fact that we haven't done anything about limiting the process so we can do our business.

1725
03:21:08,505 --> 03:21:14,888
[SPEAKER_20]: We've done that, but that doesn't eliminate to get rid of the situation because you don't want to hear people that have an issue.

1726
03:21:15,248 --> 03:21:16,129
[SPEAKER_20]: That's our jobs.

1727
03:21:23,152 --> 03:21:26,013
[SPEAKER_20]: And lastly, this isn't about you.

1728
03:21:27,265 --> 03:21:28,246
[SPEAKER_20]: and how you feel.

1729
03:21:28,927 --> 03:21:32,610
[SPEAKER_20]: This is about the city's charter for today, tomorrow, 10 years.

1730
03:21:36,172 --> 03:21:45,279
[SPEAKER_20]: This is the information that was gathered by a group of people that spent a lot of time figuring this out and then went through to the experts and then vetted that through the experts.

1731
03:21:45,919 --> 03:21:57,348
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, again, when we talk about, yeah, we have the right to sit here and talk about it and have an open discussion, this is probably the only question that I feel that there's an open discussion when it comes to the amount of people.

1732
03:21:58,723 --> 03:22:02,064
[SPEAKER_20]: So the representative from the Collins Senate said maybe 25 is a little low.

1733
03:22:02,844 --> 03:22:04,205
[SPEAKER_20]: 500 I think is too high.

1734
03:22:04,845 --> 03:22:12,288
[SPEAKER_20]: But let's entertain changing that to 50 people and then vet it through our legal team to move forward.

1735
03:22:14,108 --> 03:22:16,629
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think that's monumental.

1736
03:22:17,249 --> 03:22:22,371
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that still leaves a reasonable option for our residents to be heard.

1737
03:22:23,971 --> 03:22:24,992
[SPEAKER_20]: But at the same time,

1738
03:22:26,027 --> 03:22:30,788
[SPEAKER_20]: It doesn't eliminate democracy and silence people.

1739
03:22:33,148 --> 03:22:42,430
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I've heard undertones of, you know, people dictating fear and threats and what?

1740
03:22:42,850 --> 03:22:43,370
[SPEAKER_20]: Come on.

1741
03:22:46,831 --> 03:22:48,071
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a form of the people.

1742
03:22:48,311 --> 03:22:49,871
[SPEAKER_20]: Michael Marx said it over and over again.

1743
03:22:50,111 --> 03:22:51,592
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the people's form right there.

1744
03:22:51,792 --> 03:22:52,572
[SPEAKER_20]: That's their podium.

1745
03:22:53,673 --> 03:22:58,869
[SPEAKER_20]: And to limit it would be a total disrespect to this community.

1746
03:23:00,534 --> 03:23:00,935
[SPEAKER_20]: So again.

1747
03:23:02,480 --> 03:23:06,803
[SPEAKER_20]: I would make the motion that we keep section eight in place.

1748
03:23:07,483 --> 03:23:24,975
[SPEAKER_20]: We move forward by increasing the number to 50, and we put a stipulation that the petition has to be vetted through our legal team, because we don't know, because today we don't have a legal team, but in the charter review, maybe in 15 years we will.

1749
03:23:27,342 --> 03:23:32,367
[SPEAKER_20]: But this process is set in place that the mayor has KP law that they have to answer to us.

1750
03:23:32,827 --> 03:23:34,629
[SPEAKER_20]: So that wouldn't be an issue.

1751
03:23:35,209 --> 03:23:48,662
[SPEAKER_20]: So right now that would be my form of emotion on this paper to move, to continue with moving forward but with the stipulations of increasing the numbers for the petition 50 and having it vetted by our legal team.

1752
03:23:50,143 --> 03:23:52,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1753
03:23:52,884 --> 03:23:54,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have any other counselors who want to speak?

1754
03:23:56,166 --> 03:23:56,686
[SPEAKER_09]: President Behrs.

1755
03:23:57,046 --> 03:23:57,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1756
03:24:01,568 --> 03:24:06,451
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm more amenable to actually what Councilor Scarpelli said.

1757
03:24:08,412 --> 03:24:19,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Personally, I was just looking up a number of other communities and I'd like to look at a threshold of 100, but I also think that we should not dictate this for the school committee

1758
03:24:20,119 --> 03:24:27,085
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been made pretty clear through their actions and their rules that they have an opinion here.

1759
03:24:27,125 --> 03:24:28,846
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm happy to do this for the city council.

1760
03:24:29,527 --> 03:24:36,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Somerville's draft charter from their charter review has a section 211 group petitions just for the city council.

1761
03:24:36,752 --> 03:24:38,894
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't define this process for the school committee.

1762
03:24:39,535 --> 03:24:42,117
[SPEAKER_06]: So that would be something I would be comfortable with.

1763
03:24:42,197 --> 03:24:48,422
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've taken some language from the Somerville petition, Somerville charter draft,

1764
03:24:49,535 --> 03:24:54,977
[SPEAKER_06]: and some from the Charter Study Committee's recommendations to create a proposal for an amended section.

1765
03:24:56,478 --> 03:25:04,041
[SPEAKER_06]: But I've also heard from colleagues that they may want to take a different path than what Councilor Scarpelli and I have discussed.

1766
03:25:06,556 --> 03:25:06,736
[SPEAKER_20]: Yep.

1767
03:25:07,336 --> 03:25:08,657
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Cavalli.

1768
03:25:08,797 --> 03:25:09,077
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1769
03:25:09,117 --> 03:25:10,117
[SPEAKER_20]: Just one quick comment.

1770
03:25:10,617 --> 03:25:18,939
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, I think it's important with the school committee piece to keep in as well as because the school committee has actually eliminated the public participation.

1771
03:25:18,980 --> 03:25:19,980
[SPEAKER_20]: They don't even have that option.

1772
03:25:20,520 --> 03:25:29,262
[SPEAKER_20]: They have a format in place where I believe you have to send the question to be approved through the council and then be allowed to speak.

1773
03:25:29,923 --> 03:25:31,263
[SPEAKER_20]: They first have to pass that.

1774
03:25:31,663 --> 03:25:34,784
[SPEAKER_20]: So what you want to say, they have to read it and then approve it.

1775
03:25:35,577 --> 03:25:36,858
[SPEAKER_20]: So they're limited completely.

1776
03:25:36,918 --> 03:25:40,082
[SPEAKER_20]: So eliminating this with a school committee is even worse.

1777
03:25:40,702 --> 03:25:41,203
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you.

1778
03:25:42,905 --> 03:25:45,027
[SPEAKER_09]: I know members of the public have been waiting to speak.

1779
03:25:45,307 --> 03:25:47,970
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you're in person, please get in line.

1780
03:25:48,590 --> 03:25:50,792
[SPEAKER_09]: People online have been queuing for a very long time.

1781
03:25:50,813 --> 03:25:51,834
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll go to Zoom first.

1782
03:25:52,594 --> 03:25:55,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Eunice, name and address for the record once I ask you to unmute.

1783
03:25:56,398 --> 03:25:57,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Give me one second.

1784
03:26:02,006 --> 03:26:03,027
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, thank you very much.

1785
03:26:03,547 --> 03:26:07,190
[SPEAKER_13]: Eunice Brown Greenleaf Avenue full disclosure.

1786
03:26:07,330 --> 03:26:10,212
[SPEAKER_13]: I was a member of the charter study team as well.

1787
03:26:10,232 --> 03:26:26,985
[SPEAKER_13]: I think what I was originally going to say, I think has been addressed a bit, but my point was that I've heard an awful lot of discussion about how this applies to City Council and how you do public participation, but.

1788
03:26:29,679 --> 03:26:35,663
[SPEAKER_13]: The way it's written is that this would apply to the city council and the school committee.

1789
03:26:36,043 --> 03:26:52,034
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think it needs to be looked at within the lens that it is applying to both bodies and really should be standard across the board, in particular for the reasons that Councilor Scarpelli just expressed, that

1790
03:26:53,195 --> 03:27:15,873
[SPEAKER_13]: While the city council does have their public participation section at the end of each meeting where you can bring up any issue under the jurisdiction of the school committee, under the jurisdiction of the city council rather, that there is little to no opportunity on the school committee to have your voice heard.

1791
03:27:18,335 --> 03:27:26,138
[SPEAKER_13]: All of Section 8 has to be looked at with the lens that this should and does apply to both bodies.

1792
03:27:27,539 --> 03:27:43,284
[SPEAKER_13]: And lastly, I'll say that any effort by any of you to reduce or eliminate any aspect of Section 8 is, in my view, highly disappointing.

1793
03:27:43,925 --> 03:27:44,605
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

1794
03:27:46,018 --> 03:27:47,899
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Eunice.

1795
03:27:47,919 --> 03:27:49,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Chair McDonald, name and address for the record, please.

1796
03:27:49,880 --> 03:27:50,360
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1797
03:27:51,260 --> 03:27:53,501
[SPEAKER_00]: Milva McDonald, 61 Monument Street.

1798
03:27:54,302 --> 03:28:00,645
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to take a moment to shed some light on the committee's process for this particular section.

1799
03:28:02,205 --> 03:28:10,789
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I just want to say one of the overarching values of the committee was public participation, citizen participation, and that we've reflected that in the preamble.

1800
03:28:11,309 --> 03:28:14,511
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the lens through which we explored this section.

1801
03:28:15,251 --> 03:28:19,817
[SPEAKER_00]: This, as we've heard from the Collins Center, this is not uncommon.

1802
03:28:19,977 --> 03:28:22,840
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in charters across the state.

1803
03:28:23,881 --> 03:28:32,211
[SPEAKER_00]: When we looked at it, we examined charters and we saw that the range was between about 25 and 150 signatures.

1804
03:28:34,373 --> 03:28:44,602
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the value of public participation and citizen participation, we erred on the low side, but that could be a number that's fluid.

1805
03:28:45,583 --> 03:29:00,876
[SPEAKER_00]: We also, in these discussions, while we held public participation and citizen participation as a high value, we were trying to balance that with what could possibly be a potential for abuse, which is why the provision is there that only

1806
03:29:01,977 --> 03:29:24,378
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it won a petition on once one subject can only be presented once a year So the same petition can't be submitted over and over again So I just wanted to sort of talk about that and just so that you all know kind of what informed our process I also just want to make a point that I feel is getting missed and

1807
03:29:25,867 --> 03:29:38,671
[SPEAKER_00]: This discussion about whether this adds value to the present system doesn't, the fact is that the system now is in your rules and your rules can be changed.

1808
03:29:38,711 --> 03:29:43,292
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be changed tomorrow, they can be changed next year by a new council or two years from now.

1809
03:29:44,092 --> 03:29:47,533
[SPEAKER_00]: The charter means that it can't be changed.

1810
03:29:47,853 --> 03:29:53,655
[SPEAKER_00]: So that there's an inherent difference in what is in the charter and

1811
03:29:54,157 --> 03:29:56,958
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're talking about, well, people already have the right to do this.

1812
03:29:57,859 --> 03:30:02,201
[SPEAKER_00]: As has been said by the Collins Center, the charter is for the future.

1813
03:30:02,621 --> 03:30:10,265
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like just sort of comparing it against what people can do now misses that point, and I just wanted to make that point.

1814
03:30:10,646 --> 03:30:11,466
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1815
03:30:12,306 --> 03:30:13,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1816
03:30:14,428 --> 03:30:18,149
[SPEAKER_09]: Going back to Zoom, Matthew Page Lieberman, name and address for the record.

1817
03:30:18,250 --> 03:30:19,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Once I ask you, I'll mute.

1818
03:30:22,040 --> 03:30:24,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Matthew Page Lieberman, 15 Canal Street.

1819
03:30:24,201 --> 03:30:27,223
[SPEAKER_02]: I really, really appreciate what Chair McDonald just explained.

1820
03:30:27,283 --> 03:30:32,185
[SPEAKER_02]: I think particularly about the fact that it is at the discretion of the council.

1821
03:30:32,205 --> 03:30:39,369
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm very sorry I did not turn on the camera because it is, you know, it is at the discretion of the council.

1822
03:30:39,689 --> 03:30:45,933
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we recently passed a law that it had been at the discretion of the police department not to cooperate with ICE.

1823
03:30:45,993 --> 03:30:49,915
[SPEAKER_02]: However, in the wisdom of this council and the wisdom of many people in the community, we understood that it's

1824
03:30:50,295 --> 03:30:53,138
[SPEAKER_02]: it's much better to have that law to protect people.

1825
03:30:54,119 --> 03:31:00,244
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that, you know, New England has, you know, a great history about citizen participation.

1826
03:31:00,544 --> 03:31:04,047
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very unfortunate, a lot of it has been kind of devolved into councils.

1827
03:31:05,068 --> 03:31:08,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that we should respect, very much respect that.

1828
03:31:08,671 --> 03:31:15,798
[SPEAKER_02]: And I find this kind of a very difficult situation, because there are people on this council, who I really like it as people, yet who are presenting

1829
03:31:16,853 --> 03:31:19,857
[SPEAKER_02]: not very rigorous arguments in order to remove this passage.

1830
03:31:21,199 --> 03:31:23,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Things like talking about a filibuster.

1831
03:31:23,602 --> 03:31:27,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand why we were talking about filibuster when there's no such thing as clother.

1832
03:31:29,318 --> 03:31:34,320
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing that can be blocked by allowing members of the community to speak.

1833
03:31:34,861 --> 03:31:44,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Arguments like saying, well, this is not a direct democracy, it's a representative democracy, that's really not an argument on its merit about whether or not we should allow that.

1834
03:31:44,425 --> 03:31:50,207
[SPEAKER_02]: That's more of an argument of us pretending that we are confined by our present

1835
03:31:50,928 --> 03:31:51,568
[SPEAKER_02]: reality.

1836
03:31:51,949 --> 03:31:59,617
[SPEAKER_02]: When one of the things I used to lament about previous city councils that people say, don't talk to us, talk to the mayor, it's out of our purview.

1837
03:32:00,398 --> 03:32:06,145
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really appreciated that this new council has found ways to expand the work that you've done.

1838
03:32:06,605 --> 03:32:08,968
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that you can do that.

1839
03:32:09,829 --> 03:32:11,350
[SPEAKER_02]: I've not really heard.

1840
03:32:12,051 --> 03:32:30,668
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, yeah, especially this thing about at one's discretion now people are saying the public can already come and speak but we all we all know, we all know, especially because the Council will not enforce its own rules about time limits about how long counselors can speak that there are many residents who may not be able to speak until one o'clock in the morning.

1841
03:32:31,905 --> 03:32:33,967
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is also at the Council's discretion.

1842
03:32:34,127 --> 03:32:37,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Every meeting, when to allow that, it keeps getting pushed back.

1843
03:32:37,229 --> 03:32:39,070
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it really doesn't pass.

1844
03:32:39,250 --> 03:32:41,052
[SPEAKER_02]: We really can't say that it's equal.

1845
03:32:41,352 --> 03:32:43,053
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a hearing could be 6pm.

1846
03:32:43,093 --> 03:32:46,835
[SPEAKER_02]: The Council could still have discretion about various things about a hearing.

1847
03:32:46,876 --> 03:32:48,677
[SPEAKER_02]: A hearing could last perhaps an hour.

1848
03:32:49,577 --> 03:32:53,020
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, this is very, very inappropriate.

1849
03:32:53,641 --> 03:33:01,747
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do not like the idea that, yes, I think it was eventually introduced by Councilor Collins, but the idea was floated by Councilor Lemming, who is not a member of this body.

1850
03:33:02,287 --> 03:33:14,937
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess, but this whole process has opened up to me that apparently I could have written, you know, a giant treatise and put it on a blog and set it to a councilor, and then a councilor introduced that to strike a whole thing.

1851
03:33:14,957 --> 03:33:16,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, as far as my,

1852
03:33:16,618 --> 03:33:22,000
[SPEAKER_02]: As a resident, I would have never imagined that I could have introduced that a councilor would have taken it seriously.

1853
03:33:22,240 --> 03:33:29,443
[SPEAKER_02]: And because Councilor Lemming is not a part of this body, I really think you should consider, this governor's body, I really think you should consider that process.

1854
03:33:29,723 --> 03:33:31,143
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, refer to legal.

1855
03:33:35,305 --> 03:33:35,665
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1856
03:33:35,765 --> 03:33:37,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Going in person to

1857
03:33:40,127 --> 03:33:41,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, name and address for the record.

1858
03:33:42,811 --> 03:33:45,014
[SPEAKER_10]: Jean Zotter, 36 Saunders Street.

1859
03:33:47,297 --> 03:33:52,944
[SPEAKER_10]: I was on the Charter Study Committee, and I support the 8-1 pre-petition section.

1860
03:33:55,367 --> 03:34:01,550
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to point out that first sentence.

1861
03:34:02,271 --> 03:34:10,375
[SPEAKER_10]: City Council and school committee shall hold a public hearing on every petition addressed to City Council, blah, blah, blah.

1862
03:34:11,287 --> 03:34:13,669
[SPEAKER_10]: and that seeks passage of a measure.

1863
03:34:14,550 --> 03:34:26,480
[SPEAKER_10]: So the way that we were thinking about this wasn't, I could get a petition and I could rant, because I don't like Justin, or it wasn't meant for that kind of a public forum.

1864
03:34:26,500 --> 03:34:32,325
[SPEAKER_10]: It was if you have an ordinance or some sort of measure that falls within your legislative body,

1865
03:34:33,206 --> 03:34:38,030
[SPEAKER_10]: I as a public could come to you and ask that you debate this measure.

1866
03:34:39,631 --> 03:34:44,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, I can reach out to a city councilor, but maybe not everyone wants to return my phone calls.

1867
03:34:44,936 --> 03:34:46,337
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't get it in through

1868
03:34:47,825 --> 03:34:55,914
[SPEAKER_10]: contacting the city councilor, this is the one mechanism the public has for you to pass an ordinance, which is, you know, sort of your job.

1869
03:34:56,495 --> 03:35:01,961
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I'm not saying that facetiously, but that's like sort of the point of city council.

1870
03:35:02,021 --> 03:35:03,824
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not so I can come and

1871
03:35:04,404 --> 03:35:09,687
[SPEAKER_10]: complain about trash or pickup or whatever, it's more asking you to consider an ordinance.

1872
03:35:09,727 --> 03:35:19,111
[SPEAKER_10]: And we saw this as a stopgap to a citizen initiative petition or measure, which, you know, would be collecting all the signatures and putting it on a ballot.

1873
03:35:19,131 --> 03:35:26,035
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is sort of a release valve where someone could get this on here first, see if city council would address it, and then

1874
03:35:28,556 --> 03:35:35,778
[SPEAKER_10]: City Council would address it, and then if not, you could go through the initiative petition process or the initiative.

1875
03:35:37,379 --> 03:35:42,120
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not, it can't be abused, and I want to come and complain about Councilor Lazaro.

1876
03:35:42,140 --> 03:35:44,001
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you'd rule that out.

1877
03:35:44,041 --> 03:35:45,902
[SPEAKER_10]: You have the discretion as to what goes on here.

1878
03:35:45,942 --> 03:35:48,282
[SPEAKER_10]: It's more if I have an ordinance that I want you to consider.

1879
03:35:48,302 --> 03:35:51,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Did I talk about that the way you would think about it?

1880
03:35:55,323 --> 03:35:56,904
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was our thinking on that.

1881
03:35:56,924 --> 03:35:57,304
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1882
03:35:57,324 --> 03:36:00,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Gene, your comments actually made me, gave me a question.

1883
03:36:00,847 --> 03:36:11,155
[SPEAKER_09]: When you were considering, when the committee was considering the measure part, were you considering like ordinances and resolutions separately?

1884
03:36:11,195 --> 03:36:15,498
[SPEAKER_09]: Like as those one, like the ordinance is a measure, the resolution isn't a measure?

1885
03:36:16,899 --> 03:36:19,060
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know that we got to that level of detail.

1886
03:36:21,422 --> 03:36:23,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's in the beginning part.

1887
03:36:33,136 --> 03:36:37,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, give me one sec to scroll up.

1888
03:36:38,179 --> 03:36:50,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Measure is defined as any ordinance order or other vote or proceeding adopted or which might be adopted by the city council or the school committee.

1889
03:36:51,627 --> 03:36:52,487
[SPEAKER_09]: So any vote?

1890
03:36:55,369 --> 03:36:58,311
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I guess we have a follow-up from President Beresford.

1891
03:36:59,248 --> 03:37:03,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think to Councilor Zaro's comment or other vote leaves it pretty open.

1892
03:37:03,789 --> 03:37:10,130
[SPEAKER_06]: But I also, again, and this is where I come back to with the school committee, the school committee is an executive body and a legislative body.

1893
03:37:10,830 --> 03:37:12,670
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is where my concern comes back in.

1894
03:37:13,290 --> 03:37:19,291
[SPEAKER_06]: They have authority over contracts, authority over personnel matters, authority over certain appointments.

1895
03:37:19,491 --> 03:37:28,153
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, significantly expanded executive authority compared to this body as a council being solely legislative.

1896
03:37:30,355 --> 03:37:40,097
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would note similarly, so there's no sort of free petition to the mayor proposed here to petition any sort of executive authority on the city side of things.

1897
03:37:40,137 --> 03:37:41,877
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's, again, where my concern comes in.

1898
03:37:43,778 --> 03:37:54,680
[SPEAKER_06]: The definition of measure here as applied to the school committee certainly could be, I think, read incredibly expansively into executive authority.

1899
03:37:56,164 --> 03:37:58,286
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, executive actions by the executive.

1900
03:37:58,626 --> 03:38:03,510
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there are quasi executive legislative committee that makes, I mean, essentially runs the Metro Public Schools.

1901
03:38:06,732 --> 03:38:19,442
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just that between that reality and this definition of measure, I think applying this section equally to the both bodies creates unintended consequences potentially.

1902
03:38:20,202 --> 03:38:21,163
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a way to

1903
03:38:22,050 --> 03:38:29,678
[SPEAKER_10]: exclude that portion, but still focus on the function of the school committee that is legislative?

1904
03:38:30,459 --> 03:38:34,784
[SPEAKER_06]: That I don't feel like I know enough about how they work to answer that question.

1905
03:38:37,487 --> 03:38:37,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you have a?

1906
03:38:37,907 --> 03:38:43,153
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be difficult.

1907
03:38:43,725 --> 03:38:55,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Just for people at home, because the mics don't reach the audience, the call-in center rep said that it would be difficult to separate out the executive functions or votes of the school committee from this.

1908
03:38:56,772 --> 03:39:00,194
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, going on Zoom to Tony Tanks.

1909
03:39:00,334 --> 03:39:01,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address for the record.

1910
03:39:06,425 --> 03:39:08,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Tony Tang, 16 Locust Street.

1911
03:39:09,027 --> 03:39:27,018
[SPEAKER_05]: I had my hand raised prior to Councilor Scarpelli and other people who have already stated what I'm about to say or reiterate, but the Charter Committee was forward thinking when they created this rule, and they worked really hard on this Charter proposal.

1912
03:39:27,379 --> 03:39:33,583
[SPEAKER_05]: So they were thinking ahead, and yes, this council may allow some public speaking now, and they're fair with that and whatnot,

1913
03:39:34,363 --> 03:39:59,810
[SPEAKER_05]: uh future councils there's there's no guarantee that this council or future council uh won't change the rules so i think this this is an important part of the charter that that residents really want and uh i would i would hope that you uh consider that and uh you know like uh what was stated the school committee has already restricted the uh the way they they allow participation and uh i think that that's uh you know not not not not really uh

1914
03:40:00,988 --> 03:40:02,029
[SPEAKER_05]: what this community wants.

1915
03:40:02,189 --> 03:40:04,010
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, hope you consider that.

1916
03:40:04,510 --> 03:40:04,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1917
03:40:04,911 --> 03:40:09,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, just let me mention that the council was our council was our microphone is very low.

1918
03:40:09,974 --> 03:40:10,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't even hear.

1919
03:40:11,315 --> 03:40:13,296
[SPEAKER_05]: And the podium volume is low at times, too.

1920
03:40:13,336 --> 03:40:16,078
[SPEAKER_05]: If people could speak into the volume microphone, that would be helpful.

1921
03:40:16,578 --> 03:40:16,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1922
03:40:17,839 --> 03:40:18,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Got it.

1923
03:40:18,179 --> 03:40:18,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1924
03:40:18,819 --> 03:40:20,020
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll I'll try to adjust that.

1925
03:40:20,040 --> 03:40:25,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, seeing no further comments in person, Zachary sure talk.

1926
03:40:26,644 --> 03:40:27,665
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll unmute you.

1927
03:40:27,705 --> 03:40:30,327
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you could just give us your just again for the record.

1928
03:40:30,467 --> 03:40:30,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1929
03:40:32,220 --> 03:40:48,922
[SPEAKER_12]: Zachary chart talk five almond street so first I want to echo echo Matthew page Lieberman that several terms and references have been made to concepts and constructs that either don't apply to local government structures on the part of the city council or don't apply to these particular provisions.

1930
03:40:50,083 --> 03:41:03,429
[SPEAKER_12]: Second, with regard to the notion of superior government compliance raised earlier, it is incumbent upon the city solicitor a legal representation in the absence of one therein to manage city procedural and codification compliance with changing state and federal regulations and rulings.

1931
03:41:04,110 --> 03:41:15,355
[SPEAKER_12]: City charter passage yields to higher governance and its subordinate role, and it's generally the responsibility of the city's codified governance to manage compliance, usually through stricken provisions when higher level changes take place.

1932
03:41:16,576 --> 03:41:27,488
[SPEAKER_12]: As an aside, there are a lot of cities and towns across the country that maintain regular legal review cadences set to maintain a base level for alteration thresholds amidst changing higher level legislation compliance.

1933
03:41:27,548 --> 03:41:34,516
[SPEAKER_12]: So, raising that as an issue now, I think is irresponsible in the absence of legal representation here on the floor.

1934
03:41:36,078 --> 03:41:50,652
[SPEAKER_12]: Third, in terms of Medford's differentiated structure from its neighbors, the nature of smaller government structure here with fewer permanent policy subdivisions does require and call a necessity to more open city hall environment than neighboring cities and towns.

1935
03:41:52,133 --> 03:42:02,739
[SPEAKER_12]: And fourth, with regard to open petitions, it could be advisable to set a population percentage based scale to determine the thresholds on the basis of the changing demography of the city, which continues to fluctuate.

1936
03:42:03,600 --> 03:42:10,063
[SPEAKER_12]: Open petitions should require feasible thresholds without requisite changes to other open participation procedures.

1937
03:42:10,583 --> 03:42:17,407
[SPEAKER_12]: So there should be a separation between the petition and the considerations for open petitions and public participation.

1938
03:42:17,467 --> 03:42:18,328
[SPEAKER_12]: They're not the same thing.

1939
03:42:19,849 --> 03:42:30,118
[SPEAKER_12]: Negating open petitions can run afoul of free assembly constructs and the right to, God forbid, sue the city or petition for the removal of an official on the part of the public.

1940
03:42:31,059 --> 03:42:40,187
[SPEAKER_12]: My reference here isn't necessarily intended to call that into action at this time for any reason, but it does run afoul of that check and balance.

1941
03:42:41,560 --> 03:42:53,410
[SPEAKER_12]: And to that end, alongside the percentage weight recommendations for thresholds, separate codification should be included for approaching and calling on council and committee members to bring resolutions to the floor in place of petitions under reasonable conditions.

1942
03:42:53,910 --> 03:42:54,250
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1943
03:42:57,253 --> 03:42:57,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1944
03:42:58,834 --> 03:43:02,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing no comment in person, I'm going to Gaston Fury.

1945
03:43:02,156 --> 03:43:04,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address for the record, please.

1946
03:43:05,559 --> 03:43:06,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, give me one second.

1947
03:43:11,275 --> 03:43:12,116
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, Chair Seng.

1948
03:43:12,136 --> 03:43:14,339
[SPEAKER_32]: Gaston Fiore, 61 Stickney Road.

1949
03:43:15,781 --> 03:43:20,968
[SPEAKER_32]: My main points have already been mentioned, so I'm just going to repeat them briefly to re-emphasize.

1950
03:43:21,448 --> 03:43:26,114
[SPEAKER_32]: So first of all, this section specifically says

1951
03:43:27,235 --> 03:43:31,778
[SPEAKER_32]: in the first paragraph after the comma, and that seeks the passage of a measure.

1952
03:43:32,539 --> 03:43:49,630
[SPEAKER_32]: So I see this makes this section different from public participation at the end of city council meetings, because there will have to be a goal of why this free petition is being pursued.

1953
03:43:50,310 --> 03:43:53,913
[SPEAKER_32]: And regarding the possibilities of abuse, there's two,

1954
03:43:54,639 --> 03:43:57,881
[SPEAKER_32]: things that they have implemented to try to prevent that.

1955
03:43:57,981 --> 03:44:04,604
[SPEAKER_32]: So the first one, it says that hearings on two or more petitions filed under this section may be held at the same time and place.

1956
03:44:05,464 --> 03:44:11,987
[SPEAKER_32]: So it's not that, you know, every meeting you could possibly have a, you know, a new petition and then you have filibuster.

1957
03:44:13,028 --> 03:44:16,049
[SPEAKER_32]: You can just condense them on a single date.

1958
03:44:16,330 --> 03:44:20,312
[SPEAKER_32]: And most importantly, at the end of the paragraph, it says,

1959
03:44:21,970 --> 03:44:27,334
[SPEAKER_32]: No hearings shall be required on a petition addressing the same content more than once each year.

1960
03:44:27,414 --> 03:44:34,899
[SPEAKER_32]: So I think here we're just discussing something that really makes no sense because I don't imagine how a

1961
03:44:35,501 --> 03:44:46,784
[SPEAKER_32]: particular group of people would just like, you know, get together every single week and try to think about what new issue they can put into a free petition to just impede the progress of the city council.

1962
03:44:46,804 --> 03:44:48,184
[SPEAKER_32]: That just to me makes no sense.

1963
03:44:48,964 --> 03:45:03,708
[SPEAKER_32]: And the last thing that I would like to say is that I think it is very important to have this possibility of open, of resident participation in the city charter because we saw last year that the city council actually reduced

1964
03:45:04,408 --> 03:45:19,209
[SPEAKER_32]: The participation time allowed in city council meetings from five to three minutes, and the three minute limit for people to speak at city council meetings particularly hurts underrepresented minorities with English as a second language.

1965
03:45:20,235 --> 03:45:24,438
[SPEAKER_32]: which we have to speak slower and people sometimes have trouble understanding us.

1966
03:45:24,798 --> 03:45:34,684
[SPEAKER_32]: So I think it's essential to have some protections for resident participation in the city charter that cannot be modified on any given term by the city council.

1967
03:45:34,784 --> 03:45:35,464
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you very much.

1968
03:45:36,805 --> 03:45:37,625
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Gaston.

1969
03:45:39,407 --> 03:45:43,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Paul Rousseau, name and address for the record, please.

1970
03:45:46,150 --> 03:45:46,471
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.

1971
03:45:47,605 --> 03:45:56,211
[SPEAKER_29]: Hello, power so 22 be Orchard Street mentioned Massachusetts, I just wanted to make a correction that one of the counselors said earlier.

1972
03:45:58,425 --> 03:46:03,929
[SPEAKER_29]: The school committee since June of 2021 has had public participation.

1973
03:46:04,389 --> 03:46:07,731
[SPEAKER_29]: It is actually very much similar to the discussion we're having tonight.

1974
03:46:09,472 --> 03:46:13,875
[SPEAKER_29]: Any one person, you don't even have to get 25, can add an item to our agenda.

1975
03:46:15,016 --> 03:46:24,862
[SPEAKER_29]: And we actually have a determination the superintendent legal counsel make to determine whether it's within the authority and whether it's legal, meaning you can't put a petition to

1976
03:46:25,983 --> 03:46:33,128
[SPEAKER_29]: or ask a teacher or a student or any kind of thing that is not appropriate legally.

1977
03:46:33,989 --> 03:46:45,476
[SPEAKER_29]: It is literally printed on every single agenda we have had since June of 2021, yet it continues to be repeated ad nauseum that we don't allow public participation.

1978
03:46:45,677 --> 03:46:50,020
[SPEAKER_29]: If one person sending an email isn't enough to get you on an agenda,

1979
03:46:51,260 --> 03:46:54,043
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm really unclear what is a lower threshold.

1980
03:46:55,063 --> 03:47:00,187
[SPEAKER_29]: So I would appreciate it if certain folks could stop repeating something that is just not true.

1981
03:47:01,609 --> 03:47:06,893
[SPEAKER_29]: It's true that the school committee does not have a open mic section of our meetings.

1982
03:47:07,273 --> 03:47:11,657
[SPEAKER_29]: The school committee meeting is not the people's chamber.

1983
03:47:12,197 --> 03:47:18,042
[SPEAKER_29]: It is a business meeting with a long list of legally required business that must get done.

1984
03:47:19,465 --> 03:47:25,590
[SPEAKER_29]: if the council goes 10 sessions in a row, 10 terms in a row and doesn't pass a single ordinance.

1985
03:47:26,995 --> 03:47:27,835
[SPEAKER_29]: You'll all be fine.

1986
03:47:28,515 --> 03:47:31,476
[SPEAKER_29]: We have things that are required by law to get done.

1987
03:47:31,496 --> 03:47:35,977
[SPEAKER_29]: And you have some as well, of course, for like other things that you do.

1988
03:47:36,097 --> 03:47:39,097
[SPEAKER_29]: But our meetings are business meetings.

1989
03:47:39,137 --> 03:47:43,718
[SPEAKER_29]: They're not meetings for the public to come and yell about anything, frankly.

1990
03:47:44,658 --> 03:47:47,518
[SPEAKER_29]: But we do provide that ability for you to do that.

1991
03:47:47,779 --> 03:47:50,399
[SPEAKER_29]: And it's right on every single agenda of our website.

1992
03:47:50,839 --> 03:47:52,379
[SPEAKER_29]: It's policy, B-E-D-H.

1993
03:47:52,499 --> 03:47:56,240
[SPEAKER_29]: You can find that on the Metric Movement School's website.

1994
03:47:57,016 --> 03:47:57,336
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

1995
03:47:59,117 --> 03:47:59,518
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1996
03:48:00,418 --> 03:48:08,664
[SPEAKER_09]: I see one more public comment request back from Eunice because this is the second time we'll stick to city council rules.

1997
03:48:08,864 --> 03:48:09,505
[SPEAKER_09]: You have one minute.

1998
03:48:15,189 --> 03:48:16,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address for the record, please.

1999
03:48:18,531 --> 03:48:19,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have Eunice's?

2000
03:48:20,400 --> 03:48:23,622
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, sorry, no, uh, I didn't have my hand up at all.

2001
03:48:23,642 --> 03:48:25,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but just for the record.

2002
03:48:26,063 --> 03:48:27,223
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, sorry, Eunice Brown.

2003
03:48:27,804 --> 03:48:28,324
[SPEAKER_13]: Green lights.

2004
03:48:28,404 --> 03:48:33,046
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, sorry, no, uh, I didn't have my hand up at all.

2005
03:48:34,367 --> 03:48:35,688
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't have my hand up at all.

2006
03:48:35,748 --> 03:48:44,112
[SPEAKER_09]: But, uh, hearing what Mr Russo, uh, um, Matthew Page Lieberman, you have one minute.

2007
03:48:45,679 --> 03:48:48,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I just, I remembered something.

2008
03:48:48,240 --> 03:48:57,124
[SPEAKER_02]: So a few years back, I guess there was a meeting, there was a subcommittee meeting with rules, I guess, I think Zach was chair, Kit was vice chair, and then Adam was still remaining.

2009
03:48:57,144 --> 03:49:02,926
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember I was trying to speak, and I said, well, I cannot get any copy of what's going to be discussed.

2010
03:49:03,346 --> 03:49:08,530
[SPEAKER_02]: And Adam was just being Adam, and he said, well, you should have asked the clerk for this document so you could read it.

2011
03:49:08,550 --> 03:49:09,391
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very aggressive.

2012
03:49:09,731 --> 03:49:17,278
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Zach explained that, actually, I don't have any legal right by state law to speak or to attend a meeting.

2013
03:49:17,518 --> 03:49:18,819
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's because we know.

2014
03:49:18,859 --> 03:49:20,720
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, that's right by state law.

2015
03:49:21,101 --> 03:49:27,286
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, I think we know that, I mean, these are meetings where you all are applying Robert's rules, and you are first members.

2016
03:49:27,666 --> 03:49:28,687
[SPEAKER_02]: and we are guests.

2017
03:49:29,127 --> 03:49:30,388
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's always at your discretion.

2018
03:49:30,648 --> 03:49:31,609
[SPEAKER_02]: It can always be taken away.

2019
03:49:31,649 --> 03:49:37,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the school committee is doing it again, but years ago I had to like send an email and then somebody would talk about it.

2020
03:49:38,274 --> 03:49:44,999
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, I mean, it should not be just at your discretion at what time we're allowed to talk during meetings.

2021
03:49:45,379 --> 03:49:46,840
[SPEAKER_02]: The public should have a right to a hearing.

2022
03:49:48,121 --> 03:49:48,762
[SPEAKER_02]: What is this noise?

2023
03:49:51,204 --> 03:49:52,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2024
03:49:53,205 --> 03:49:55,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have any final public comments?

2025
03:49:55,407 --> 03:49:56,708
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a few motions on the floor.

2026
03:49:58,298 --> 03:50:06,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, I believe we have two motions and do we have any more motions to add to that to consider together?

2027
03:50:07,387 --> 03:50:07,967
[SPEAKER_09]: President Behrs.

2028
03:50:08,348 --> 03:50:18,517
[SPEAKER_06]: I would propose an amendment to the motion on the floor, the first motion on the floor to amend the language

2029
03:50:19,771 --> 03:50:27,977
[SPEAKER_06]: have the title to read group petitions, which is what the Somerville Charter proposal says, and then amend the language to read as follows.

2030
03:50:28,998 --> 03:50:37,785
[SPEAKER_06]: The City Council shall hold a public hearing and act with respect to every petition which is addressed to it, which is signed by at least 100 municipal voters as certified by the Board of Election Commissioners.

2031
03:50:38,654 --> 03:50:41,658
[SPEAKER_06]: along with their addresses, and that seeks the passage of a measure.

2032
03:50:42,298 --> 03:50:50,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Once received, the petition shall be reviewed by the city's legal department to ensure it does not conflict with any provisions of general law regarding public hearings and legally permissible topics thereof.

2033
03:50:51,881 --> 03:51:01,209
[SPEAKER_06]: If approved for consideration, a hearing shall be held by the city council or a committee or a subcommittee thereof, and the city council shall act on the petition within three months of filing with the city clerk.

2034
03:51:01,869 --> 03:51:05,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Hearings on two or more petitions filed under this section may be held at the same time and place.

2035
03:51:06,413 --> 03:51:18,563
[SPEAKER_06]: At least 14 days before the hearing, the city clerk shall notify 10 petitioners whose names first appear on each such petition, publish a general summary of the subject matter of the petition, and post notice of the date and time of the public hearing.

2036
03:51:19,203 --> 03:51:24,165
[SPEAKER_06]: hearing should not be held on any subject more than once in a given 12 month period as determined by the council president.

2037
03:51:25,706 --> 03:51:26,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2038
03:51:26,586 --> 03:51:28,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so we have three motions on the floor.

2039
03:51:28,747 --> 03:51:30,308
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll take them in order.

2040
03:51:30,788 --> 03:51:34,049
[SPEAKER_09]: I propose that as an amendment to whatever motion you're going to take.

2041
03:51:34,109 --> 03:51:37,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the first motion is vice president Collins.

2042
03:51:45,772 --> 03:51:51,554
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a combination of the Somerville Charter, which I know you guys worked on, and the Charter Study Committee's proposal.

2043
03:51:57,736 --> 03:52:00,897
[SPEAKER_15]: Can we rework the whole legal discussion?

2044
03:52:02,477 --> 03:52:04,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Reword how that, I phrased that?

2045
03:52:04,478 --> 03:52:04,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2046
03:52:04,838 --> 03:52:07,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, if you have a better phrasing, I'm happy to take that.

2047
03:52:07,519 --> 03:52:13,401
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I just may put it in parenthesis, because I'm not gonna wordsmith it here.

2048
03:52:13,741 --> 03:52:13,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2049
03:52:15,247 --> 03:52:24,294
[SPEAKER_06]: So something after the signatures are received, before the hearing is scheduled, some sort of legal review, and you guys can come up with that in the next couple of weeks?

2050
03:52:28,697 --> 03:52:29,597
[SPEAKER_06]: For the legal section?

2051
03:52:30,118 --> 03:52:31,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm fine with that.

2052
03:52:31,359 --> 03:52:32,459
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll just change that.

2053
03:52:35,482 --> 03:52:38,484
[SPEAKER_06]: That there's some, and I mean, I just, that part I just kind of went.

2054
03:52:39,580 --> 03:52:44,622
[SPEAKER_06]: That I'd wordsmith myself, but the rest of it was from the two drafts.

2055
03:52:48,844 --> 03:52:53,546
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm happy to just change that to, I'll leave my language in there so you can see it.

2056
03:52:53,626 --> 03:53:02,870
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's of any value to you, it will be sent to you, but also Collins Center can draft a phrase around the legal.

2057
03:53:03,451 --> 03:53:05,752
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, what the parameters were.

2058
03:53:05,912 --> 03:53:08,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, draft language.

2059
03:53:09,095 --> 03:53:10,136
[SPEAKER_06]: around legal review.

2060
03:53:10,156 --> 03:53:16,041
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I'll put that in parentheses, if so everyone's clear.

2061
03:53:17,802 --> 03:53:20,004
[SPEAKER_09]: If you could send that to me as well.

2062
03:53:20,405 --> 03:53:23,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm gonna send, I'm doing a document, I'll send it to everybody.

2063
03:53:23,447 --> 03:53:34,877
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it's essentially it's city council 100 legal review and everything else basically stay the same, but there's a little extra notice to the public 14 days instead of 10.

2064
03:53:42,514 --> 03:53:50,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so let me just ask Councilor Collins if she wants to keep her motion or withdraw it for President Beresey's motion.

2065
03:53:54,238 --> 03:53:55,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Collins, are you on?

2066
03:53:55,338 --> 03:53:57,098
[SPEAKER_30]: I will withdraw.

2067
03:53:57,279 --> 03:53:57,559
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

2068
03:53:59,065 --> 03:54:07,688
[SPEAKER_09]: So the only motion we have on the floor pending review by the Collins Center is the language proposed by President Ferris.

2069
03:54:08,568 --> 03:54:10,448
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have a motion from President Ferris.

2070
03:54:10,488 --> 03:54:11,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have a second for it?

2071
03:54:11,869 --> 03:54:13,509
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a second from Councilor Scarpelli.

2072
03:54:17,751 --> 03:54:18,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Whenever you're ready.

2073
03:54:21,172 --> 03:54:22,292
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Collins.

2074
03:54:24,053 --> 03:54:24,273
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2075
03:54:27,334 --> 03:54:28,014
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Zara.

2076
03:54:29,785 --> 03:54:32,649
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Scarpelli, President Beers.

2077
03:54:33,290 --> 03:54:33,510
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2078
03:54:34,651 --> 03:54:35,192
[SPEAKER_21]: Chairman Singh.

2079
03:54:35,392 --> 03:54:35,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2080
03:54:36,013 --> 03:54:38,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Five in favor, none opposed, motion passes.

2081
03:54:38,316 --> 03:54:39,718
[SPEAKER_06]: And they say we can't get anything done.

2082
03:54:40,739 --> 03:54:42,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, we came to a compromise, right?

2083
03:54:43,750 --> 03:54:52,233
[SPEAKER_09]: It never happens here, except it always happens here.

2084
03:54:52,313 --> 03:54:52,913
[SPEAKER_09]: I credit you.

2085
03:54:55,574 --> 03:54:58,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Section 8-2, Citizen Initiative Measures.

2086
03:54:58,475 --> 03:55:00,575
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have any public comments on this one?

2087
03:55:01,516 --> 03:55:03,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Keohokalole?

2088
03:55:03,576 --> 03:55:05,037
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, Councilor comments on this one.

2089
03:55:05,057 --> 03:55:08,898
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just going to mute people's mics so I can tell who is.

2090
03:55:10,158 --> 03:55:10,358
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

2091
03:55:12,579 --> 03:55:12,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2092
03:55:15,935 --> 03:55:19,998
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have any councilor comments on section 8-2 citizen initiative measures?

2093
03:55:20,478 --> 03:55:21,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Lumming.

2094
03:55:25,421 --> 03:55:33,666
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, so I did have questions I was hoping the Collins Center could address as to the relationship between this and 8-3, if that's acceptable.

2095
03:55:34,086 --> 03:55:34,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, sure.

2096
03:55:39,690 --> 03:55:43,996
[SPEAKER_22]: So I went over these two and thought about them in pretty big detail with

2097
03:55:52,751 --> 03:56:04,319
[SPEAKER_22]: So my understanding of both of these is that basically for 8-2, a citizen collects 250 signatures, and there's a committee that's formed, but I'm gonna mainly focus on the signature counts.

2098
03:56:05,280 --> 03:56:11,664
[SPEAKER_22]: Then they then collect signatures from 5% of voters, which for Medford would be about 2,200.

2099
03:56:12,164 --> 03:56:16,247
[SPEAKER_22]: My understanding is that that's registered voters, which would be the 44,000 number, correct?

2100
03:56:17,908 --> 03:56:18,848
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

2101
03:56:19,268 --> 03:56:23,830
[SPEAKER_22]: And then that forces the city council or school committee to vote on that particular issue.

2102
03:56:23,850 --> 03:56:36,474
[SPEAKER_22]: And if they vote no or they do something in lieu, then those citizens have an additional two months to collect an additional 5%, so 4,400 total.

2103
03:56:36,494 --> 03:56:39,355
[SPEAKER_22]: And then that initiative gets voted on the ballot.

2104
03:56:40,435 --> 03:56:42,096
[SPEAKER_22]: Is that inaccurate?

2105
03:56:42,477 --> 03:56:42,697
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

2106
03:56:42,737 --> 03:56:46,699
[SPEAKER_22]: And so with 8-3, it's a bit more stringent.

2107
03:56:47,180 --> 03:57:00,188
[SPEAKER_22]: It basically says if the city or council or school committee vote on something and a group of citizens disagree with it, they basically have three weeks to collect signatures from 12% of voters, which is about 5,300.

2108
03:57:02,670 --> 03:57:06,311
[SPEAKER_22]: which would temporarily stop that measure and then put it up for a special election.

2109
03:57:06,371 --> 03:57:21,359
[SPEAKER_22]: So I guess the only thing I, the only kind of twist here was I understand that the advantage of 8-3 would be that it stops the, it stops the measure temporarily to wait for the special election.

2110
03:57:21,899 --> 03:57:29,883
[SPEAKER_22]: But other than that, is there sort of like any substantive difference between an initiative and a referendum?

2111
03:57:43,243 --> 03:57:58,927
[SPEAKER_22]: So could somebody effectively use an initiative to accomplish what they would have done in 8-3 regardless, just with the lower signature count and more time to get those signatures?

2112
03:58:00,387 --> 03:58:00,627
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

2113
03:58:07,552 --> 03:58:15,878
[SPEAKER_22]: But okay, but what I'm saying is for an initiative measure, if the council or school committee does something, can the citizens just have an initiative measure to undo that?

2114
03:58:16,658 --> 03:58:19,080
[SPEAKER_22]: Or is that not allowed for some reason with the initiative rules?

2115
03:58:24,364 --> 03:58:25,805
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, sorry.

2116
03:58:25,885 --> 03:58:28,186
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.

2117
03:58:29,047 --> 03:58:29,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2118
03:58:30,168 --> 03:58:30,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

2119
03:58:31,174 --> 03:58:42,262
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, so I guess what I guess, so I do understand the advantage here of having 8-3 be able to temporarily stop that.

2120
03:58:42,762 --> 03:58:52,309
[SPEAKER_22]: But I also see it as like three weeks to collect 5,300 signatures just seems like kind of an impossible standard for somebody.

2121
03:58:52,369 --> 03:58:58,773
[SPEAKER_22]: And it just seems a lot more likely to me that citizens that oppose a particular motion would just go with the 8-2 route.

2122
03:59:00,843 --> 03:59:06,067
[SPEAKER_22]: Or is there, I just want to sort of understand the logic, because I've kind of been thinking about these different situations.

2123
03:59:06,307 --> 03:59:20,637
[SPEAKER_22]: And I just don't understand why somebody would spend three weeks collecting 12% of signatures when they also have the option to basically collect 10% of signatures in, what is it, three, five months.

2124
03:59:21,438 --> 03:59:27,522
[SPEAKER_15]: OK, so there is no referendum election, is what you're saying.

2125
03:59:30,078 --> 03:59:38,503
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, the council acts, and then someone starts an initiative process to undo that.

2126
03:59:39,343 --> 03:59:42,425
[SPEAKER_22]: OK, so the referendum never doesn't actually get placed on the ballot.

2127
03:59:43,345 --> 03:59:43,586
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

2128
03:59:43,946 --> 03:59:47,088
[SPEAKER_22]: OK, so there is no special election under 8-3.

2129
03:59:47,368 --> 03:59:47,848
[SPEAKER_15]: No, there is.

2130
03:59:49,049 --> 03:59:54,592
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I'm trying to follow your logic or your scenario here.

2131
03:59:55,212 --> 03:59:56,033
[SPEAKER_15]: The council acts.

2132
03:59:56,273 --> 03:59:57,473
[SPEAKER_15]: There is no referendum.

2133
03:59:58,214 --> 03:59:58,374
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2134
03:59:59,560 --> 04:00:06,544
[SPEAKER_15]: OK, but instead of referendum, a group of citizens started an initiative to undo what was just done.

2135
04:00:06,784 --> 04:00:07,024
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2136
04:00:07,604 --> 04:00:08,985
[SPEAKER_15]: And replace it with something else.

2137
04:00:09,205 --> 04:00:09,445
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2138
04:00:09,885 --> 04:00:10,066
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

2139
04:00:10,546 --> 04:00:11,346
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, yeah.

2140
04:00:11,366 --> 04:00:19,010
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm just trying to understand why somebody would prefer a referendum, which gives them less time to collect more signatures when they could just go for an initiative.

2141
04:00:19,710 --> 04:00:24,273
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I think it depends on what the issue is, I mean, or what the concern is.

2142
04:00:26,194 --> 04:00:26,514
[SPEAKER_15]: Doesn't it?

2143
04:00:27,555 --> 04:00:39,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think what's not super, what wasn't clear but is clearer to me now is what you said about initiatives are about creating something and referendums are about stopping.

2144
04:00:39,205 --> 04:00:46,951
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the stopping is in the definition in the charter for referendum, but the creating isn't for initiatives in the definition section of the charter.

2145
04:00:47,271 --> 04:00:47,391
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh.

2146
04:00:47,571 --> 04:00:49,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, so, sorry.

2147
04:00:49,453 --> 04:00:50,093
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

2148
04:00:50,134 --> 04:00:50,554
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, no.

2149
04:00:50,594 --> 04:00:53,716
[SPEAKER_22]: So I do understand that that is one

2150
04:00:54,697 --> 04:01:02,127
[SPEAKER_22]: The only advantage that I can see is the stopping it under the referendum so they get three so they do get three weeks to stop it, it just seems like that's a very.

2151
04:01:02,147 --> 04:01:10,118
[SPEAKER_22]: I just don't just when it comes to collecting 5300 signatures I just don't see why any group of citizens would prefer to.

2152
04:01:11,038 --> 04:01:16,739
[SPEAKER_22]: to go for the much higher standard instead of just going for the 10%, which they could just collect anyway.

2153
04:01:16,979 --> 04:01:37,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I guess very simply put, what I'm hearing from Councilor Lemming, and correct me if I'm wrong about understanding what you're saying, under how the charter is written right now in the definitions of initiative process and referendum, you can do exactly what you would do with the referendum using the initiative process, which has a lower bar to entry.

2154
04:01:38,603 --> 04:01:38,783
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

2155
04:01:40,393 --> 04:01:41,794
[SPEAKER_06]: except it doesn't pause.

2156
04:01:42,994 --> 04:01:45,255
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, that's the only advantage I can see.

2157
04:01:45,536 --> 04:01:49,097
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, there is no referendum election.

2158
04:01:49,498 --> 04:01:53,820
[SPEAKER_06]: That law is in effect.

2159
04:01:54,500 --> 04:02:03,544
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of my things here was just trying to be consistent across the scope of the initiative, the referendum, and the recall.

2160
04:02:04,125 --> 04:02:04,485
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think

2161
04:02:06,368 --> 04:02:16,842
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm guessing these are standard terminologies that are used in a lot of charters, but to me, initiative and referendum are words that often are used to mean the same thing.

2162
04:02:17,062 --> 04:02:17,242
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

2163
04:02:17,823 --> 04:02:22,890
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it might be helpful to use different language, something like

2164
04:02:24,959 --> 04:02:39,484
[SPEAKER_06]: a veto or a repeal or something like that when we're talking about the referendum and something maybe some sort of positive modifier to the word initiative to indicate that it's creative in some way, just so that it's clear that there's kind of a

2165
04:02:42,713 --> 04:02:50,159
[SPEAKER_06]: and positive idea of an initiative versus the idea of countering the action of a body through the referendum.

2166
04:02:51,200 --> 04:03:05,752
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think that's a lot more legible and understandable by the average person because to me, I mean, especially if you're moving here from somewhere else and nevermind that we call ours questions and propositions and neither we don't call them initiatives or referendums when we're talking about the state ballot.

2167
04:03:07,073 --> 04:03:08,074
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think something that-

2168
04:03:10,775 --> 04:03:14,217
[SPEAKER_15]: constitution provides an initiative, but you can use it for referendum purpose.

2169
04:03:14,597 --> 04:03:17,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, yeah.

2170
04:03:18,620 --> 04:03:19,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

2171
04:03:20,761 --> 04:03:29,947
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, just all of these interchangeable words, I think having some sort of modifier in there to more clearly elucidate the intent of each section would be helpful.

2172
04:03:30,567 --> 04:03:35,110
[SPEAKER_06]: And then my other question here really, and something I'd like to think about proposing

2173
04:03:36,794 --> 04:03:40,597
[SPEAKER_06]: is that the thresholds and the timelines be the same for all of the processes.

2174
04:03:41,738 --> 04:03:43,859
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't recommend that, and I'm wondering why.

2175
04:03:44,540 --> 04:03:46,762
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, recall is a real thing.

2176
04:03:46,962 --> 04:03:48,103
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's get it out of the way.

2177
04:03:48,684 --> 04:03:49,664
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, let's move it.

2178
04:03:51,206 --> 04:03:52,967
[SPEAKER_15]: It's very disruptive to a community.

2179
04:03:53,387 --> 04:03:54,288
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

2180
04:03:54,348 --> 04:03:56,930
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why that timeline is tight.

2181
04:03:56,950 --> 04:03:58,912
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not impossible.

2182
04:03:58,972 --> 04:03:59,633
[SPEAKER_15]: It can be done.

2183
04:04:01,174 --> 04:04:04,577
[SPEAKER_06]: And the timeline is 40 days for the recall.

2184
04:04:05,762 --> 04:04:08,544
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I mean, they have 28 days to collect the signatures.

2185
04:04:09,484 --> 04:04:12,686
[SPEAKER_15]: And the election is 60 days after that.

2186
04:04:12,846 --> 04:04:13,046
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's 20.

2187
04:04:13,226 --> 04:04:15,187
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, where's the 28 days?

2188
04:04:15,207 --> 04:04:16,068
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 40, I think.

2189
04:04:16,989 --> 04:04:18,690
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, they changed it?

2190
04:04:18,730 --> 04:04:19,050
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

2191
04:04:19,150 --> 04:04:22,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it says said recall petition shall be returned and filed within 40 days.

2192
04:04:22,472 --> 04:04:22,732
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

2193
04:04:23,392 --> 04:04:26,154
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we have 21 for the referendum, the repeal.

2194
04:04:26,973 --> 04:04:27,413
[SPEAKER_06]: counter.

2195
04:04:27,973 --> 04:04:35,836
[SPEAKER_06]: We have 40 for the recall, and then I think we had 60 or something for the initiative.

2196
04:04:37,156 --> 04:04:47,179
[SPEAKER_15]: The initiative, you have to go out to the voters, you have to explain what this is, what it's going to do, and then you have to get them to sign.

2197
04:04:47,479 --> 04:04:49,879
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a public education process.

2198
04:04:50,179 --> 04:04:50,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

2199
04:04:50,520 --> 04:04:51,720
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that's true of all three.

2200
04:04:52,692 --> 04:05:01,817
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, but referendum, if the council has done something that has, you know, drawn the ire of enough people, that will be on the streets very quickly.

2201
04:05:02,957 --> 04:05:05,558
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think that's subjective, to be honest.

2202
04:05:06,539 --> 04:05:12,262
[SPEAKER_15]: I just, I cannot see an initiative happening in the same time.

2203
04:05:13,325 --> 04:05:15,607
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, I didn't even make my proposal yet.

2204
04:05:15,647 --> 04:05:17,008
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually suggesting more time.

2205
04:05:17,809 --> 04:05:22,353
[SPEAKER_06]: So 45 days for recall, 45 days for referendum, 45 days for initiative.

2206
04:05:23,194 --> 04:05:31,060
[SPEAKER_06]: And that way you don't have this kind of arbitrage opportunity for picking a different mode because you have more time to do one or another.

2207
04:05:31,080 --> 04:05:33,362
[SPEAKER_15]: I think referendum, it depends on what it is.

2208
04:05:34,043 --> 04:05:40,108
[SPEAKER_15]: If it's something that's going to have a deleterious impact on the community fairly quickly,

2209
04:05:41,325 --> 04:05:43,866
[SPEAKER_06]: But nothing prevents them from turning it in sooner than 45 days.

2210
04:05:47,808 --> 04:05:48,968
[SPEAKER_15]: No, they're not.

2211
04:05:49,268 --> 04:05:53,910
[SPEAKER_06]: So if they're really mad about it, I'm giving them 45 instead of 21.

2212
04:05:54,190 --> 04:06:00,213
[SPEAKER_15]: It just makes the process longer.

2213
04:06:00,393 --> 04:06:04,734
[SPEAKER_15]: And the longer the processes are, the harder it is to keep the voters' attention.

2214
04:06:05,575 --> 04:06:05,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

2215
04:06:05,895 --> 04:06:10,997
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess what I'm saying is also, though, 21 days is probably, you're just not going to be able to do it.

2216
04:06:13,348 --> 04:06:21,535
[SPEAKER_06]: I think my point is that if you're right, and people are really angry, and they want to get it done really fast, they'll collect all the signatures in 15 days either way.

2217
04:06:22,416 --> 04:06:27,420
[SPEAKER_06]: But maybe they need between 21 and 45 days to collect the signatures.

2218
04:06:27,921 --> 04:06:30,623
[SPEAKER_15]: It just to me, it seems... Time is the enemy of these things.

2219
04:06:32,284 --> 04:06:37,609
[SPEAKER_15]: But is it the... But I guess then my question is... The longer it's on the street, then it doesn't feel real, it doesn't feel urgent.

2220
04:06:38,498 --> 04:06:39,878
[SPEAKER_15]: The idea is to keep it urgent.

2221
04:06:39,958 --> 04:06:43,099
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that you could make the same argument for the initiative or the recall.

2222
04:06:43,419 --> 04:06:46,039
[SPEAKER_15]: No, you can't, because initiative is a brand new thing.

2223
04:06:47,360 --> 04:06:50,500
[SPEAKER_06]: To most voters, I think a referendum is a brand new thing.

2224
04:06:50,540 --> 04:06:55,901
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we're not having a... I think this is a subjective... I really don't.

2225
04:06:56,001 --> 04:07:01,702
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, initiative requires much more public education and engagement of the voters.

2226
04:07:02,942 --> 04:07:03,822
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess, why?

2227
04:07:04,763 --> 04:07:06,603
[SPEAKER_15]: Because they've never seen this before.

2228
04:07:07,124 --> 04:07:12,209
[SPEAKER_15]: And but I'm saying most of what it is, what it does for them, how it would take effect.

2229
04:07:13,570 --> 04:07:16,613
[SPEAKER_06]: And why is that different from something that the council passed?

2230
04:07:19,896 --> 04:07:21,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Most people wouldn't have seen that either.

2231
04:07:21,217 --> 04:07:25,321
[SPEAKER_09]: They wouldn't.

2232
04:07:26,162 --> 04:07:27,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's my experience.

2233
04:07:27,703 --> 04:07:28,844
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's true.

2234
04:07:29,104 --> 04:07:31,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we don't have great attendance at our meetings.

2235
04:07:31,667 --> 04:07:32,507
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have a ton of

2236
04:07:33,372 --> 04:07:35,052
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think most residents are reading.

2237
04:07:35,072 --> 04:07:36,753
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't even have a newspaper.

2238
04:07:37,253 --> 04:07:40,614
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't post your vote on the website?

2239
04:07:40,654 --> 04:07:47,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, but I think if you were to look at the reading, it's not like 10,000 people are taking a look at that every week that we make votes.

2240
04:07:48,776 --> 04:07:50,517
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess it's in a word or mouth.

2241
04:07:51,537 --> 04:07:57,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what I'm saying is my point is I think we should have more time for all of these measures, and then it should be consistent.

2242
04:07:58,519 --> 04:07:59,119
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't understand.

2243
04:07:59,139 --> 04:08:01,520
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't understand this semi-inconsistency.

2244
04:08:02,920 --> 04:08:03,901
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no rationale for it.

2245
04:08:04,661 --> 04:08:07,882
[SPEAKER_06]: My rationale is that what's the difference between an initiative and a referendum?

2246
04:08:08,063 --> 04:08:08,823
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see one.

2247
04:08:09,263 --> 04:08:15,886
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't understand why you'd give someone who wants to stop the council from doing something less time than you would give someone who wants to create a new thing more time.

2248
04:08:19,068 --> 04:08:22,109
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually arguing against the council's power.

2249
04:08:22,129 --> 04:08:28,432
[SPEAKER_06]: So for people who are making faces about it, I don't understand why you wouldn't give people more time.

2250
04:08:30,372 --> 04:08:35,697
[SPEAKER_19]: I think there's an intent to recognize the authority that lawyers have given to your body.

2251
04:08:36,718 --> 04:08:44,364
[SPEAKER_19]: And much like in many other forms, court, for example, you can have three years to file a lawsuit.

2252
04:08:45,085 --> 04:08:49,329
[SPEAKER_19]: But when the case is tried, you have 30 days to appeal.

2253
04:08:49,389 --> 04:08:49,469
[SPEAKER_19]: Sure.

2254
04:08:49,769 --> 04:08:51,170
[SPEAKER_19]: You can get another three years.

2255
04:08:51,871 --> 04:08:54,914
[SPEAKER_19]: Even though someone might want to file a separate lawsuit, they get three.

2256
04:08:57,413 --> 04:08:59,214
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I'm fine with that.

2257
04:08:59,274 --> 04:09:04,816
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it means that it's harder for residents to appeal or try to repeal an action by the council.

2258
04:09:18,748 --> 04:09:20,449
[SPEAKER_06]: that it is for them to propose a new idea.

2259
04:09:20,469 --> 04:09:24,752
[SPEAKER_06]: And personally, I have less of a stake in the time frames here.

2260
04:09:25,192 --> 04:09:37,140
[SPEAKER_06]: I just felt the consistency made sense because I think these are generally fundamentally the same things and that if a resident or a group of residents wants to try to create something or repeal something or recall an elected official,

2261
04:09:38,073 --> 04:09:40,574
[SPEAKER_06]: I personally wouldn't want to give them different timeframes to do that.

2262
04:09:41,054 --> 04:09:43,175
[SPEAKER_06]: My bigger concern is around the thresholds.

2263
04:09:43,215 --> 04:09:44,115
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they should all be 15%.

2264
04:09:44,255 --> 04:09:58,799
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that defining these thresholds differently and having a different democratic threshold for these different proposals, that does work me a little bit more than the timeframes.

2265
04:09:59,239 --> 04:10:00,840
[SPEAKER_06]: But I appreciate the spirit of discussion.

2266
04:10:05,037 --> 04:10:15,562
[SPEAKER_00]: When the committee discussed Milton McDonald 61 Monument Street, when we discussed referendum, when we were discussing the timelines, we did see them as initiative and referendum as inherently different.

2267
04:10:16,323 --> 04:10:25,147
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that we discussed was that a referendum pauses a measure that was passed by a duly elected body and that it didn't

2268
04:10:25,901 --> 04:10:31,444
[SPEAKER_00]: that that time frame, we didn't want it to be extended any more than it had to.

2269
04:10:31,464 --> 04:10:46,572
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to give the citizens the right to do it while also making sure that the elected body that passed it wasn't, that the measure wasn't put, held at bay for too long.

2270
04:10:47,072 --> 04:10:47,913
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to point that out.

2271
04:10:48,993 --> 04:10:51,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Chair Levin, or not Chair, sorry.

2272
04:10:52,255 --> 04:10:54,376
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so used to the public engagement committee.

2273
04:10:54,396 --> 04:10:55,357
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Councilor Levin.

2274
04:10:56,810 --> 04:11:00,331
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry, I was a bit confused at the sudden promotion.

2275
04:11:03,152 --> 04:11:11,354
[SPEAKER_22]: No, no, I mean, I was actually just genuinely curious on the logic behind the two of those.

2276
04:11:12,394 --> 04:11:23,718
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I think what you, to me what you did say about the justification for the timeframes and what Chairman McDonnell just said also do make sense.

2277
04:11:26,591 --> 04:11:27,614
[SPEAKER_22]: Are we not talking about recalls?

2278
04:11:29,099 --> 04:11:29,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't we hold.

2279
04:11:30,647 --> 04:11:30,847
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2280
04:11:31,007 --> 04:11:37,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Or, I mean, actually, we can do all three, as long as people can sort it.

2281
04:11:38,572 --> 04:11:39,152
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, yeah.

2282
04:11:39,172 --> 04:11:41,793
[SPEAKER_22]: So we brought up the percentages and keeping them all at 15%.

2283
04:11:42,854 --> 04:11:51,759
[SPEAKER_22]: And so with recalls, we're going to get into this conversation, because these are related.

2284
04:11:52,599 --> 04:11:54,501
[SPEAKER_22]: I do have a couple of concerns.

2285
04:11:55,081 --> 04:11:57,182
[SPEAKER_22]: One is the two-year terms.

2286
04:11:59,523 --> 04:11:59,924
[SPEAKER_22]: issue.

2287
04:12:00,024 --> 04:12:09,029
[SPEAKER_22]: So my reading of the Charter Study Committee's final report was that the recalls did seem to be targeted at the mayor having a four-year term.

2288
04:12:09,069 --> 04:12:11,470
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, that's what was written there.

2289
04:12:11,550 --> 04:12:16,993
[SPEAKER_22]: Like they said, we do need recalls because we're proposing to extend it.

2290
04:12:17,974 --> 04:12:19,795
[SPEAKER_22]: But they apply to all elected officials.

2291
04:12:20,375 --> 04:12:21,196
[SPEAKER_22]: And having the

2292
04:12:22,516 --> 04:12:34,919
[SPEAKER_22]: having a recall on a two-year term, and I've received this feedback, it's actually in the, the Charter Study Committee collected like four comments about recalls, and three of them disfavored it.

2293
04:12:35,479 --> 04:12:39,240
[SPEAKER_22]: One of them just seemed to think it was only for, seemed to only favor for the mayor.

2294
04:12:39,760 --> 04:12:47,002
[SPEAKER_22]: But like one thing that we always hear is that, is that like basically the recall period for a two-year term is just the next election.

2295
04:12:47,742 --> 04:12:50,745
[SPEAKER_22]: So that is one criticism of that that I always hear.

2296
04:12:51,085 --> 04:13:09,281
[SPEAKER_22]: The other thing with the percentages in reference to a recall is for the proposed ward, district, et cetera positions, the standard seems to be very different for at-large positions versus ward positions.

2297
04:13:09,321 --> 04:13:09,461
[SPEAKER_22]: So 20%

2298
04:13:11,002 --> 04:13:13,524
[SPEAKER_22]: Right now, in this current draft, it says 20% of voters.

2299
04:13:13,564 --> 04:13:14,805
[SPEAKER_22]: You have 40 days to collect that.

2300
04:13:15,125 --> 04:13:20,349
[SPEAKER_22]: That's about 8,800 signatures for at-large counselors, school committee members, and the mayor.

2301
04:13:20,709 --> 04:13:25,012
[SPEAKER_22]: That's about 1,000 for award counselor.

2302
04:13:25,093 --> 04:13:29,256
[SPEAKER_22]: Or if we go with districts, it's about 2,200.

2303
04:13:29,616 --> 04:13:32,078
[SPEAKER_22]: So the standards for those just seem to be

2304
04:13:33,118 --> 04:13:47,845
[SPEAKER_22]: very different, and it seems that certain positions could be more subject to the, let's say it like, for lack of a better term, the threat of a recall, whereas others, it's just much harder to mobilize that number of people in that period of time.

2305
04:13:48,385 --> 04:13:59,831
[SPEAKER_22]: The other concern that I also have is just with 8-7, which says that the city council can just put a recall, like my reading of it anyways, that the city council can just put a recall on the ballot, which

2306
04:14:01,316 --> 04:14:13,406
[SPEAKER_22]: for any of these positions, which is another thing that makes me a little bit iffy about that, because that just seems like a lot of power for this body.

2307
04:14:16,409 --> 04:14:21,352
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, so 8-7 does not imply that the City Council can just do that, okay.

2308
04:14:22,253 --> 04:14:25,596
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, because this is another thing that I communicated.

2309
04:14:30,567 --> 04:14:30,847
[SPEAKER_15]: any measure.

2310
04:14:32,288 --> 04:14:38,233
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, so so that so that so that's that's a misconception on my part under this the City Council does not have that authority.

2311
04:14:38,914 --> 04:14:39,114
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

2312
04:14:39,154 --> 04:14:40,755
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for thank you for clarifying that.

2313
04:14:43,410 --> 04:14:50,374
[SPEAKER_22]: Regardless, it did seem like a lot of the recall was to prevent a situation like the one in Fall River from happening.

2314
04:14:50,414 --> 04:14:56,737
[SPEAKER_22]: So that, I think, was the most egregious instance of the need for a recall and a constitutional crisis that happened there.

2315
04:14:57,117 --> 04:15:06,002
[SPEAKER_22]: But it also seems like this draft of the charter does kind of solve that, because it automatically throws out any elected official who is convicted of a felony.

2316
04:15:06,522 --> 04:15:12,025
[SPEAKER_22]: So that does seem like some of those extreme cases are addressed by that.

2317
04:15:13,225 --> 04:15:13,526
[SPEAKER_22]: area.

2318
04:15:13,546 --> 04:15:17,508
[SPEAKER_22]: So those are those are my kind of so okay.

2319
04:15:17,528 --> 04:15:19,570
[SPEAKER_22]: So those are my thoughts on the recall.

2320
04:15:19,590 --> 04:15:24,373
[SPEAKER_22]: And if my reading of 87 was incorrect, then I apologize.

2321
04:15:24,453 --> 04:15:26,695
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll update whatever it before on that.

2322
04:15:26,855 --> 04:15:31,198
[SPEAKER_22]: But but yeah, so that's just to put it out there for my colleagues.

2323
04:15:31,238 --> 04:15:31,578
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2324
04:15:32,419 --> 04:15:32,939
[SPEAKER_09]: President bears.

2325
04:15:34,280 --> 04:15:37,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Chair saying and Councilor Lemming.

2326
04:15:38,183 --> 04:15:40,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, I think for this, you know, when I looked at the math

2327
04:15:41,822 --> 04:15:43,804
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't start a recall in the first six months.

2328
04:15:43,844 --> 04:15:45,866
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't start a recall in the last six months.

2329
04:15:46,987 --> 04:15:53,433
[SPEAKER_06]: You need 145 days, or you have between 119 and 145 days to even get it done anyway.

2330
04:15:53,453 --> 04:16:03,302
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you're probably holding a special election where you're probably not getting 20% turnout, if we're being honest.

2331
04:16:12,914 --> 04:16:20,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, that would be my inclination or to say that the recall should be limited to any office that has a four year term.

2332
04:16:21,897 --> 04:16:25,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, right now that would just be the mayor under this charter.

2333
04:16:25,138 --> 04:16:34,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I just think we're talking about most likely having the city spend a bunch of money on a special election that doesn't reach the turnout and then having an election within.

2334
04:16:35,601 --> 04:16:41,083
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, and then we have, then we have those communities that actually engage in pressing terms.

2335
04:16:42,160 --> 04:16:42,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

2336
04:16:42,780 --> 04:16:44,101
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know which ones do that.

2337
04:16:44,181 --> 04:16:49,584
[SPEAKER_14]: We certainly... No, in terms of a recall election, they don't vote.

2338
04:16:50,245 --> 04:16:50,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

2339
04:16:50,965 --> 04:16:55,228
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a campaign tactic in and of itself is to say, if you don't vote, then it's invalid anyway.

2340
04:16:56,549 --> 04:16:56,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2341
04:16:57,249 --> 04:17:04,533
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, I mean, I think this section generally avoids the Fall River situation where, at least as far as I read it,

2342
04:17:06,450 --> 04:17:10,874
[SPEAKER_06]: the vacancy is you're not electing the new person on the same ballot, right?

2343
04:17:10,894 --> 04:17:15,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Which was the Fall River Nightmare where they were recalled, but then reelected on the same ballot.

2344
04:17:18,120 --> 04:17:25,126
[SPEAKER_06]: I shouldn't tell you this, but I interned with that person in Senator John Kerry's office many, many years ago.

2345
04:17:26,748 --> 04:17:27,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Who would have known?

2346
04:17:29,190 --> 04:17:31,151
[SPEAKER_06]: But that situation,

2347
04:17:35,026 --> 04:17:36,107
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure anyone could have found it out.

2348
04:17:36,147 --> 04:17:39,111
[SPEAKER_06]: There's, you know, lists of that.

2349
04:17:39,231 --> 04:17:49,344
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I mean, for me, it really, I have a hard time with the recalls for the two-year terms given the conditions laid out here.

2350
04:17:49,364 --> 04:17:52,267
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2351
04:17:55,628 --> 04:18:03,092
[SPEAKER_09]: I will say to your point, too, about the money being spent, we have to remember that schools will have to close for people to be able to vote as well.

2352
04:18:03,132 --> 04:18:06,053
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's a disruption to the school day.

2353
04:18:06,414 --> 04:18:09,255
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw Councilor Zaro first.

2354
04:18:09,975 --> 04:18:10,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sorry, wrong mic.

2355
04:18:12,457 --> 04:18:14,978
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I'll recognize Councilor Lemming.

2356
04:18:15,358 --> 04:18:16,199
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2357
04:18:16,599 --> 04:18:24,463
[SPEAKER_26]: I initially was going to suggest that we not include

2358
04:18:25,183 --> 04:18:28,545
[SPEAKER_26]: measure for a recall for a two-year term.

2359
04:18:29,106 --> 04:18:49,019
[SPEAKER_26]: But I, upon hearing or really like delving into the details of it, I actually think that with the restrictions President Behrs articulated here, I mean, were something to rise to the level, are you guys?

2360
04:18:51,993 --> 04:19:11,586
[SPEAKER_26]: for something to rise to the level of a crisis where, you know, something would need to happen and it would be, but it would be very difficult, you know, something would have to be very, very extreme to warrant a recall of a two year elected official.

2361
04:19:11,826 --> 04:19:17,270
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think that maybe having the opportunity for it to stay in there is,

2362
04:19:19,475 --> 04:19:22,396
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't, I actually, I think it needs to be hard.

2363
04:19:22,677 --> 04:19:25,418
[SPEAKER_26]: It needs to be hard to recall somebody to your term.

2364
04:19:25,978 --> 04:19:30,160
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think that I'm changing my mind and that it should stay.

2365
04:19:31,260 --> 04:19:31,500
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2366
04:19:32,901 --> 04:19:33,901
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2367
04:19:34,522 --> 04:19:38,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have any other comments from President Behrs?

2368
04:19:38,623 --> 04:19:40,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Mildly, I don't disagree with you.

2369
04:19:40,164 --> 04:19:42,485
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think it's functionally essentially impossible.

2370
04:19:45,298 --> 04:19:45,518
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

2371
04:19:46,339 --> 04:19:47,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Lozano?

2372
04:19:47,419 --> 04:19:53,223
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I guess I was gonna say that we should strike it or it should be almost impossible.

2373
04:19:53,764 --> 04:20:05,452
[SPEAKER_26]: It should be like so hard that it would have to be such an egregious thing that the voters would have to be so enraged by whatever happened that they would be willing to go through

2374
04:20:06,172 --> 04:20:14,418
[SPEAKER_26]: you know, the process and like, of course, the timing being difficult, at a certain point, you just like don't reelect them, right?

2375
04:20:14,458 --> 04:20:16,259
[SPEAKER_26]: So it's the same difference, right?

2376
04:20:16,299 --> 04:20:16,839
[SPEAKER_26]: Exactly.

2377
04:20:17,119 --> 04:20:28,907
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you might end up it seemed to be, I don't know if it seemed to me, and this was another question I had, that you could potentially end up with a recall question, and the reelection of the same seat on the same ballot.

2378
04:20:30,288 --> 04:20:33,811
[SPEAKER_06]: It said, let me see, like,

2379
04:20:35,628 --> 04:20:38,329
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, but I guess I'm saying it's it is in there.

2380
04:20:38,489 --> 04:20:39,209
[SPEAKER_14]: It's line 39 of page 30 line.

2381
04:20:39,229 --> 04:20:39,370
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2382
04:20:39,390 --> 04:20:43,711
[SPEAKER_06]: If any other city elections to occur with occur within 120 days after the date of the certificate.

2383
04:20:43,731 --> 04:20:43,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2384
04:20:43,891 --> 04:20:44,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2385
04:21:01,429 --> 04:21:02,789
[SPEAKER_06]: What would happen in that scenario?

2386
04:21:02,830 --> 04:21:22,156
[SPEAKER_06]: If someone was to be, wouldn't we end up in a fall river situation where the person was recalled, so they'd be removed for... But if the person is subject to recall, this is not about the charter, this is about the community or the municipality.

2387
04:21:22,176 --> 04:21:22,476
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

2388
04:21:22,676 --> 04:21:27,177
[SPEAKER_15]: So you think someone would be tracked to run for that seat?

2389
04:21:28,298 --> 04:21:29,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Possibly, sure.

2390
04:21:31,475 --> 04:21:32,976
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying, isn't it possible?

2391
04:21:32,996 --> 04:21:35,118
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think again, it's unlikely.

2392
04:21:35,138 --> 04:21:50,150
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, I think most of these outcomes are unlikely, but if you were to have the same office recalled on the city ballot within the next term on the ballot, you could end up in a situation where a majority of voters vote to recall, but a plurality of voters vote to elect the person for the next term.

2393
04:21:53,413 --> 04:21:58,377
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, if they have, is it a contest, right?

2394
04:21:59,011 --> 04:21:59,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

2395
04:22:00,153 --> 04:22:00,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

2396
04:22:00,833 --> 04:22:01,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2397
04:22:01,354 --> 04:22:07,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Or what I'm saying, say for at-large, you may need your thresholds lower.

2398
04:22:07,742 --> 04:22:08,843
[SPEAKER_06]: So you'd end up in that situation.

2399
04:22:08,883 --> 04:22:12,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, 50% of people said recall, but 35% said reelect Jason Correa.

2400
04:22:13,549 --> 04:22:16,733
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just, again, I think it's just with the two-year piece.

2401
04:22:18,570 --> 04:22:35,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, President bears I think to your point, I think much of this reads like it was written for like a four year mayoral term and then the two year aspect was added in after the fact so with the point that with the few lines that I just pointed out for me it reads like you know if the mayor.

2402
04:22:36,528 --> 04:22:47,574
[SPEAKER_09]: faces a recall election, and it's two years into her term, or their term, and, you know, the city election is within 120 days, and you hold it with the municipal election with which you're electing everyone else.

2403
04:22:47,774 --> 04:22:50,075
[SPEAKER_09]: That's, I think, what the purpose was for.

2404
04:22:50,456 --> 04:23:02,482
[SPEAKER_09]: But then I think us, or I think Medford trying to shove in two-year offices to the recall process as well, has made that, those few lines really confusing.

2405
04:23:03,723 --> 04:23:04,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Just, yeah.

2406
04:23:06,347 --> 04:23:09,909
[SPEAKER_15]: vacancy provisions be used to fill the seat?

2407
04:23:13,831 --> 04:23:14,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

2408
04:23:17,572 --> 04:23:21,914
[SPEAKER_15]: So if it's on the November ballot, there's two months left in the term.

2409
04:23:22,375 --> 04:23:22,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

2410
04:23:23,755 --> 04:23:28,677
[SPEAKER_15]: So the person elected doesn't take off until January.

2411
04:23:29,358 --> 04:23:29,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

2412
04:23:29,658 --> 04:23:33,500
[SPEAKER_06]: So you'd end up with the second place finisher from the previous election serving the last two months.

2413
04:23:34,494 --> 04:23:47,537
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just, I think the person, if such a scenario were to play out, I think the perception would be regardless of if the process and procedure was followed correctly, that the charter didn't work because someone was recalled and then reelected on the same ballot.

2414
04:23:49,198 --> 04:23:53,219
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a, it's an outlier situation, but you know.

2415
04:23:54,779 --> 04:23:56,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Never say never.

2416
04:23:56,259 --> 04:23:59,540
[SPEAKER_06]: That's I'm sure what they said in 1980, the Fall River Charter.

2417
04:24:04,852 --> 04:24:23,638
[SPEAKER_06]: I have one other question around eight, four ineligible measures, section, subsection three that says the, the city budget or the school committee budget as a whole, should that also say as a whole or in part?

2418
04:24:23,698 --> 04:24:30,840
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I know we don't have line item veto, but I'm guessing we don't want to give the citizen referendum process or initiative line item veto either.

2419
04:24:34,459 --> 04:24:36,260
[SPEAKER_15]: It's meant to be comprehensive.

2420
04:24:36,300 --> 04:24:43,621
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't do anything with anything in the school committee budget.

2421
04:24:43,681 --> 04:24:54,004
[SPEAKER_15]: And the reason I said that as a whole is because so many actions of the city are dependent upon other lines of appropriation.

2422
04:24:54,104 --> 04:24:56,665
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you don't want to fund snow plowing,

2423
04:24:59,418 --> 04:25:03,159
[SPEAKER_15]: you still have payroll considerations, those kinds of things.

2424
04:25:03,880 --> 04:25:08,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Would any appropriation be subject to referendum?

2425
04:25:08,241 --> 04:25:25,707
[SPEAKER_15]: If it hasn't, there is a particular capital appropriation that if there's a capital, if you're proposing to increase the funding for a capital project, you can, that went to referendum in Newton.

2426
04:25:28,212 --> 04:25:31,033
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it was for Newton North, so that was like almost 20 years ago.

2427
04:25:31,093 --> 04:25:32,293
[SPEAKER_06]: But it wasn't a debt exclusion.

2428
04:25:32,353 --> 04:25:35,794
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a on the city's debt service referendum.

2429
04:25:35,894 --> 04:25:38,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2430
04:25:38,415 --> 04:25:38,935
[SPEAKER_15]: And it did.

2431
04:25:42,116 --> 04:25:43,777
[SPEAKER_15]: It was turned down.

2432
04:25:44,277 --> 04:25:44,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2433
04:25:45,538 --> 04:25:46,358
[SPEAKER_06]: That seems

2434
04:25:47,836 --> 04:25:58,022
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want my opinion on it, I am worried that us being unspecific about this will be taken wrongly by the courts.

2435
04:25:58,722 --> 04:26:06,747
[SPEAKER_09]: I think one of the most common rules of statutory interpretation by a judge is to render, it's called the rule against surplusage.

2436
04:26:06,987 --> 04:26:10,689
[SPEAKER_09]: And basically, it assumes that as a legislature, whatever we pass, we mean.

2437
04:26:11,429 --> 04:26:15,291
[SPEAKER_09]: And whatever extra words we might add, we mean those words as well.

2438
04:26:15,832 --> 04:26:23,156
[SPEAKER_09]: And so us keeping the words as a whole in there very heavily implies to a judge that we want to allow.

2439
04:26:23,176 --> 04:26:25,017
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to allow.

2440
04:26:25,037 --> 04:26:27,619
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be inferred.

2441
04:26:28,099 --> 04:26:29,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it could be inferred.

2442
04:26:29,460 --> 04:26:34,763
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think most court decisions I read fall that way.

2443
04:26:34,783 --> 04:26:38,465
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, this is once again where some of them end up.

2444
04:26:38,972 --> 04:26:40,372
[SPEAKER_14]: can't leave 40 other charters, so.

2445
04:26:41,232 --> 04:26:46,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but I mean, the question is, has there been much litigation about that line and those charters?

2446
04:26:47,054 --> 04:26:50,714
[SPEAKER_06]: And so then we're subject to whatever the case law is, and we don't know, because there's not much.

2447
04:26:51,275 --> 04:26:51,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

2448
04:26:51,595 --> 04:26:52,475
[SPEAKER_09]: We would be the precedent.

2449
04:26:53,075 --> 04:26:58,496
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are already the precedent in Trustees of Tufts College versus City of Medford, which is the Dover Amendment case.

2450
04:26:58,576 --> 04:27:03,117
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't want us to invite that again, because we are not happy to be that precedent.

2451
04:27:03,257 --> 04:27:04,177
[SPEAKER_06]: I can tell you that.

2452
04:27:07,612 --> 04:27:08,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for the answer.

2453
04:27:08,472 --> 04:27:14,276
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess my only other question here, um, Councilor Lemming and I were talking about it.

2454
04:27:14,316 --> 04:27:15,736
[SPEAKER_06]: It may be the question he's about to ask.

2455
04:27:15,836 --> 04:27:17,937
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm sorry if I'm taking your thunder away.

2456
04:27:18,738 --> 04:27:19,738
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just about recall.

2457
04:27:20,559 --> 04:27:26,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, is it, you know, is it worth putting that in as an ineligible measure?

2458
04:27:26,102 --> 04:27:30,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, the recall of a city official, um, or also right.

2459
04:27:37,402 --> 04:27:40,283
[SPEAKER_06]: So, so it just automatically, okay.

2460
04:27:40,603 --> 04:27:47,305
[SPEAKER_06]: And then like, what about something that wasn't included in here was a change in the title of a city agency or a multi-member body.

2461
04:27:47,385 --> 04:27:55,587
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's say we went from, we've gone from the community development office to the planning development sustainability office.

2462
04:27:56,367 --> 04:27:59,268
[SPEAKER_06]: I can see potentially someone saying, we don't like how that's worded.

2463
04:28:00,609 --> 04:28:05,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you seen any sort of prohibitions against referendums on, on things like title changes or names?

2464
04:28:14,234 --> 04:28:14,954
[SPEAKER_25]: I can imagine it.

2465
04:28:21,437 --> 04:28:21,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2466
04:28:22,098 --> 04:28:22,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2467
04:28:25,539 --> 04:28:25,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2468
04:28:28,360 --> 04:28:28,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2469
04:28:29,041 --> 04:28:29,861
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I have for now.

2470
04:28:29,901 --> 04:28:31,782
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a couple of motions, but I'll wait to hear from everybody else.

2471
04:28:32,693 --> 04:28:41,777
[SPEAKER_09]: I do have written feedback from other elected officials on this stuff, but Councilor Lemming, I recognize you first, and then we'll move on to that.

2472
04:28:42,517 --> 04:28:51,460
[SPEAKER_22]: No, just want to reiterate the other point of recalls that I disfavor, but maybe we just want to emphasize it in this case.

2473
04:28:51,480 --> 04:28:54,601
[SPEAKER_22]: And I don't know how this is played out in other municipalities.

2474
04:28:54,621 --> 04:28:59,183
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just that the at-large positions have a much, much higher

2475
04:29:00,042 --> 04:29:06,567
[SPEAKER_22]: amount of effort required to initiate that recall than award counselor, and everybody gets equal votes on this body.

2476
04:29:06,647 --> 04:29:23,961
[SPEAKER_22]: So in a situation where it takes 1 4th or 1 8th of the signatures to get one elected official on the ballot versus another, that's something where, like, have you seen that dynamic affect any other municipalities or can you comment on it?

2477
04:29:26,473 --> 04:29:37,317
[SPEAKER_15]: These multi-major requirements for at-large or by any office elected city-wide is always quite high.

2478
04:29:37,377 --> 04:29:42,218
[SPEAKER_15]: They're looking to make sure that this is what the residents want.

2479
04:29:44,999 --> 04:29:47,940
[SPEAKER_22]: But for like a ward position, that just makes them more?

2480
04:29:51,073 --> 04:29:58,876
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, yeah, but that does make them, I mean, doesn't that, in effect, make them more vulnerable to potential threats of a recall?

2481
04:30:00,356 --> 04:30:04,458
[SPEAKER_15]: In terms of the ground troops, no.

2482
04:30:06,318 --> 04:30:10,260
[SPEAKER_19]: Taking from a smaller pool to begin with, you've got to get some.

2483
04:30:11,340 --> 04:30:16,422
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, it's a smaller pool, but the amount of manpower required to get those signatures is.

2484
04:30:17,382 --> 04:30:19,063
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't see a lot of.

2485
04:30:21,603 --> 04:30:27,907
[SPEAKER_15]: recalls for ward counselors.

2486
04:30:28,508 --> 04:30:30,709
[SPEAKER_22]: Is there a lot for at-large counselors in comparison?

2487
04:30:30,729 --> 04:30:32,891
[SPEAKER_15]: There are a few more.

2488
04:30:34,032 --> 04:30:41,337
[SPEAKER_15]: But mostly, it's actually the body that's most affected by recalls is school committees statewide.

2489
04:30:41,877 --> 04:30:42,518
[SPEAKER_22]: Why is that?

2490
04:30:42,538 --> 04:30:45,600
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm just curious, just actually.

2491
04:30:45,660 --> 04:30:46,100
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

2492
04:30:46,220 --> 04:30:48,322
[SPEAKER_15]: Closed school, cited school.

2493
04:30:51,275 --> 04:30:53,358
[SPEAKER_15]: So those were the issues that came up.

2494
04:30:53,518 --> 04:31:00,208
[SPEAKER_15]: Or the committee appeared to not be responsive to what the public wanted.

2495
04:31:00,248 --> 04:31:05,295
[SPEAKER_15]: But we're talking about recall being available in Massachusetts since the late 1990s.

2496
04:31:12,448 --> 04:31:31,799
[SPEAKER_22]: The other thing the other thing on my mind with like, and this only applies to out large positions really and like the mathematics of a recall is that for like let's like hypothetically let's say we did like a recall on like a member of this body, the actual threshold of votes to be able to get onto this body seems like for a lot of positions, it would be.

2497
04:31:33,251 --> 04:31:37,516
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a lower threshold to get on than it would be to keep your seat.

2498
04:31:37,616 --> 04:31:43,883
[SPEAKER_22]: So I received the least votes to get elected to city council out of anybody on this body.

2499
04:31:43,943 --> 04:31:50,130
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, I think I believe four people received less than half the ballots cast.

2500
04:31:51,131 --> 04:31:55,335
[SPEAKER_22]: But in order to retain your seat in a recall, you need more than half the votes.

2501
04:31:56,095 --> 04:32:05,924
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's another thing that makes me iffy about this is that it's a different standard for keeping your seat in a recall versus actually getting on in the first place.

2502
04:32:06,164 --> 04:32:17,213
[SPEAKER_22]: And I understand that's a hypothetical, but just from a mathematical standpoint, that's the other thing making me iffy about applying recalls.

2503
04:32:18,851 --> 04:32:19,071
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry.

2504
04:32:19,331 --> 04:32:20,051
[SPEAKER_22]: No, that's all I got.

2505
04:32:20,071 --> 04:32:20,832
[SPEAKER_22]: That's all I got.

2506
04:32:21,272 --> 04:32:24,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you need 50% to stay on, or they have to get 50% to kick you off?

2507
04:32:33,036 --> 04:32:33,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

2508
04:32:34,557 --> 04:32:34,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

2509
04:32:35,077 --> 04:32:38,138
[SPEAKER_09]: I think President Burr is the same, given that you already satisfied that hurdle.

2510
04:32:39,479 --> 04:32:39,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

2511
04:32:39,699 --> 04:32:42,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Assuming there's 20% turnout, and assuming

2512
04:32:44,022 --> 04:32:47,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Assuming there's 20% turnout, is this an affirmative or a negative?

2513
04:32:47,629 --> 04:32:52,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it 50% plus one of the voters voting must vote to recall?

2514
04:32:53,401 --> 04:32:54,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

2515
04:32:55,740 --> 04:33:05,446
[SPEAKER_09]: I will say, I've kept my opinions pretty close, you know, just close to my chest since I'm running this meeting.

2516
04:33:06,387 --> 04:33:18,235
[SPEAKER_09]: I do think there is a difference, even though there is a difference between getting the signatures in the first place and the vote actually being successful, I think it's worth the council talking about

2517
04:33:18,966 --> 04:33:29,014
[SPEAKER_09]: potential political instability that comes around when you have that signature driving process in the first place that challenges the mandate of the person sitting in office.

2518
04:33:30,095 --> 04:33:31,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Just wanted to make that point.

2519
04:33:31,597 --> 04:33:31,817
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

2520
04:33:34,215 --> 04:33:55,861
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, that was, so in another piece of the Charter Study Committee's review, there was, I believe it was in North Brookline, where two select men put on a, or like, I guess, put on a pride parade, and then people started collecting signatures for that recall to get them voted off because they put on a pride parade.

2521
04:33:55,921 --> 04:33:59,062
[SPEAKER_22]: I believe that was part of the Charter Study Committee's research.

2522
04:33:59,122 --> 04:34:02,123
[SPEAKER_22]: And that never even made it onto the ballot, but it made the news.

2523
04:34:03,306 --> 04:34:08,850
[SPEAKER_22]: which is kind of another thing that, like another component of this.

2524
04:34:11,452 --> 04:34:24,662
[SPEAKER_09]: And I do fear that driving away potential candidates for office as well, particularly from marginalized backgrounds or female candidates, to be honest, because that's a group of people that are most affected by stuff like that.

2525
04:34:25,883 --> 04:34:31,827
[SPEAKER_09]: I do have comments from school committee members on these sections that I want to read first before we move on.

2526
04:34:34,252 --> 04:34:40,757
[SPEAKER_09]: or before we move on anything, give me one quick second to pull it up.

2527
04:34:41,718 --> 04:34:54,789
[SPEAKER_09]: From Vice Chair Graham, she on three petitions, 8-1, I've read that one, on 8.4, 8-4 and eligible measures.

2528
04:34:56,850 --> 04:34:57,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, my computer.

2529
04:34:57,711 --> 04:35:01,474
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not liking the long meeting.

2530
04:35:07,185 --> 04:35:27,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Similarly, 8-4, specifically the inclusion of, quote, as a whole in item three, creates another potential disruption to the work of the school committee, allowing voters to strike parts of the budget could severely limit our ability to operate effectively, making it difficult to implement long-term plans or allocate resources appropriately.

2531
04:35:28,155 --> 04:35:34,958
[SPEAKER_09]: A budget must support the needs of every student and breaking it apart at the discretion of voters could lead to significant instability.

2532
04:35:35,652 --> 04:35:39,556
[SPEAKER_09]: I urge the removal of this language to protect the integrity of the budgeting process.

2533
04:35:41,818 --> 04:35:45,782
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the only comment I haven't read from Vice Chair Graham on Article 8.

2534
04:35:47,043 --> 04:35:49,345
[SPEAKER_09]: From Member Rousseau, I have

2535
04:35:52,302 --> 04:35:57,964
[SPEAKER_09]: on, I've read the 8.1, 8-1 brief petition comment.

2536
04:35:59,684 --> 04:36:03,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Section 8-4 in the eligible measures, very similar.

2537
04:36:03,865 --> 04:36:13,908
[SPEAKER_09]: The member Russo is suggesting us to strike the words as a whole, the rationale being this suggests that measures to strike parts of the school committee budget would be permitted.

2538
04:36:14,773 --> 04:36:18,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Allowing the public to alter our budget in this manner could lead to significant issues.

2539
04:36:19,055 --> 04:36:25,337
[SPEAKER_09]: Such changes could have unintended consequences, including hindering our ability to meet obligations to our union partners.

2540
04:36:25,798 --> 04:36:30,579
[SPEAKER_09]: This would create a chaotic situation, undermining the careful planning that goes into budget preparation.

2541
04:36:33,261 --> 04:36:40,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Also applying to this section, he says, this is about subsection eight, or seven, he's asked,

2542
04:36:45,186 --> 04:36:50,269
[SPEAKER_09]: He's suggesting that we strike that point.

2543
04:36:50,569 --> 04:36:53,371
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll read that point so people know what we're talking about.

2544
04:36:54,692 --> 04:37:02,357
[SPEAKER_09]: The point is to make ineligible a proceeding providing for the submission or referral to the voters at an election.

2545
04:37:05,229 --> 04:37:06,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I read that wrong.

2546
04:37:06,429 --> 04:37:08,250
[SPEAKER_09]: I read point eight.

2547
04:37:08,330 --> 04:37:14,352
[SPEAKER_09]: A proceeding repealing or rescinding a measure or part of it that is protested by a referendum procedures.

2548
04:37:15,032 --> 04:37:19,174
[SPEAKER_09]: His comment is that this approach seems anti-democratic.

2549
04:37:19,534 --> 04:37:31,338
[SPEAKER_09]: If we allow one group of citizens the ability to change policy, it stands to reason that another group should have the same freedom to alter policy, even if it means reverting to a previous policy or shifting in a different direction.

2550
04:37:32,570 --> 04:37:33,231
[SPEAKER_09]: on the recall.

2551
04:37:34,352 --> 04:37:48,323
[SPEAKER_09]: On part B, he is suggesting that we strike the words for the office of mayor or councillor at large and at least 300 voters for any other elected officials.

2552
04:37:50,164 --> 04:37:52,326
[SPEAKER_09]: The issue he's identified is that

2553
04:37:53,344 --> 04:37:57,966
[SPEAKER_09]: The threshold for recalling school committee members is set lower than that of four city councilors.

2554
04:37:58,106 --> 04:38:00,988
[SPEAKER_09]: This discrepancy makes no sense and lacks justification.

2555
04:38:01,388 --> 04:38:07,671
[SPEAKER_09]: The thresholds for recall should be the same for all elected positions to ensure consistency and fairness.

2556
04:38:08,231 --> 04:38:15,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Additionally, any other, quote, any other elected official can only mean school committee members as we are the only other elected officials in Medford.

2557
04:38:19,816 --> 04:38:22,618
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe this next part comes from

2558
04:38:27,229 --> 04:38:46,143
[SPEAKER_09]: lines eight to 11 on page 31, that would be point D. He's suggesting that we strike the sentence that says, should the person be a candidate in the subsequent election, that person will not be allowed to have, quote, candidate for reelection appear on the ballot at such election.

2559
04:38:47,003 --> 04:38:52,227
[SPEAKER_09]: The rationale, he says, is that this provision is unnecessarily punitive.

2560
04:38:52,898 --> 04:39:03,284
[SPEAKER_09]: If a recall effort fails and the individual is not unseated, it is unjust to impose the arbitrary consequence of losing their candidate for a re-election designation on the ballot.

2561
04:39:03,964 --> 04:39:12,990
[SPEAKER_09]: This rule could be exploited by groups aiming to systematically strip the designation from candidates they dislike, even if they anticipate the recall will not succeed.

2562
04:39:13,550 --> 04:39:18,773
[SPEAKER_09]: A failed recall should have no consequence for the elected official who succeeds in remaining in office.

2563
04:39:20,703 --> 04:39:39,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Same page, line 15, so this is point E. He is suggesting us to replace the word recalled with the phrase removed from office, saying that he doesn't think most people would know what recalled means.

2564
04:39:39,592 --> 04:39:45,135
[SPEAKER_09]: So suggesting that removed from office would be a clearer phrase to put on the ballot.

2565
04:39:45,835 --> 04:39:47,276
[SPEAKER_09]: So those are the written comments I have.

2566
04:39:50,524 --> 04:39:59,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Do I have any other comments from councillors or motions from councillors before we take public participation?

2567
04:40:00,148 --> 04:40:01,408
[SPEAKER_09]: President Beresford.

2568
04:40:01,428 --> 04:40:02,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I have a few motions.

2569
04:40:04,930 --> 04:40:10,272
[SPEAKER_06]: The first motion is regarding the threshold for citizen participation mechanisms.

2570
04:40:11,592 --> 04:40:14,893
[SPEAKER_06]: And it would just align 8-2 and 8-3 at 15%.

2571
04:40:30,372 --> 04:40:41,782
[SPEAKER_06]: So the supplemental for the citizen initiative would be that the supplemental initiative petition will be signed by a number of additional voters that is not less than 10% of the total number they're taking together.

2572
04:40:42,182 --> 04:40:47,807
[SPEAKER_06]: The total signatures taken together shall contain the signatures of not less than 15% of the total numbers of voters in the city.

2573
04:40:47,827 --> 04:40:53,332
[SPEAKER_17]: Go ahead.

2574
04:40:58,152 --> 04:41:03,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, 5% first, and then 10% if the council doesn't take action on their item.

2575
04:41:06,443 --> 04:41:08,646
[SPEAKER_06]: And then similarly for the citizen referendum, also the 15%.

2576
04:41:24,535 --> 04:41:25,575
[SPEAKER_06]: I have two more motions.

2577
04:41:26,396 --> 04:41:31,997
[SPEAKER_06]: The second motion is regarding ineligible measures.

2578
04:41:34,018 --> 04:41:50,162
[SPEAKER_06]: I would amend three to either strike as a whole or in part or other language that the Collins Center may recommend to clarify that no portion of the budget is subject to this.

2579
04:41:50,862 --> 04:41:52,283
[SPEAKER_06]: My preference

2580
04:41:54,258 --> 04:41:59,321
[SPEAKER_06]: would be that no appropriation is subject to this provision.

2581
04:42:01,002 --> 04:42:08,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Before I finish making my motion, can I ask just one further question of you guys on this question of the appropriations.

2582
04:42:08,827 --> 04:42:22,975
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounded like between the language of the city budget or the school committee budget as a whole, an appropriation for the payment of the city's debt or debt service, an appropriation of funds to implement a collective bargaining agreement,

2583
04:42:24,703 --> 04:42:29,211
[SPEAKER_06]: that that only leaves this one capital appropriation that you were talking about.

2584
04:42:29,231 --> 04:42:37,747
[SPEAKER_06]: The Newton North case that you mentioned.

2585
04:43:05,647 --> 04:43:12,352
[SPEAKER_15]: So they hadn't, they hadn't added to it yet, so we're gonna have to talk to somebody about this.

2586
04:43:12,372 --> 04:43:12,513
Okay.

2587
04:43:12,533 --> 04:43:15,115
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I don't know it all that well.

2588
04:43:15,615 --> 04:43:15,895
Okay.

2589
04:43:16,216 --> 04:43:16,816
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was a lot of time.

2590
04:43:17,557 --> 04:43:17,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2591
04:43:17,657 --> 04:43:20,239
[SPEAKER_06]: But I will object to that.

2592
04:43:20,259 --> 04:43:34,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I would amend that motion to then be, we amend section, subsections three, four, and five, pending your review to not have these referendums or initiatives on appropriations or the budgets.

2593
04:43:36,770 --> 04:43:41,913
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just want that language to be clear.

2594
04:43:42,573 --> 04:43:54,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I also moved to add section 12 here for a change in title of a city agency or multi-member body.

2595
04:44:03,850 --> 04:44:05,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, can I clarify?

2596
04:44:05,951 --> 04:44:08,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, is there any intent for that to also cover institutions?

2597
04:44:12,055 --> 04:44:15,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, our Councilor Lemming.

2598
04:44:16,717 --> 04:44:21,860
[SPEAKER_22]: So City City agency is defined under one seven.

2599
04:44:21,880 --> 04:44:30,445
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, my understanding it says any multiple member body, any department, division or office of the city of Medford.

2600
04:44:30,485 --> 04:44:32,466
[SPEAKER_22]: So my understanding is that would

2601
04:44:33,362 --> 04:44:35,923
[SPEAKER_22]: cover it?

2602
04:44:37,644 --> 04:44:38,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, that's what I'm intending.

2603
04:44:38,824 --> 04:44:40,165
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not intending anything more than that.

2604
04:44:46,647 --> 04:44:56,751
[SPEAKER_06]: And then finally, I would just move to request language from the Collins Center to have the recall provision apply to the Office of the Mayor only.

2605
04:45:19,486 --> 04:45:21,149
[SPEAKER_09]: We can take those up one by one.

2606
04:45:21,529 --> 04:45:26,776
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to allow for public participation first since we have a few people who had their hands raised for a while.

2607
04:45:28,018 --> 04:45:29,360
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll recognize Zachary.

2608
04:45:30,181 --> 04:45:31,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Give me one sec to unmute you.

2609
04:45:34,490 --> 04:45:35,931
[SPEAKER_12]: Zach Chertok, 5 Almond Street.

2610
04:45:37,412 --> 04:45:49,020
[SPEAKER_12]: Just with regard to the recalls on the two year term, if thinking of this as a forward looking document, having a codified recall process is a hedge for compliance against future changes to term limits and conditions.

2611
04:45:49,821 --> 04:45:53,223
[SPEAKER_12]: It also codifies a process for extreme, potentially unlikely situations.

2612
04:45:53,303 --> 04:46:02,609
[SPEAKER_12]: It's already been referenced and inserting the two year term after the recall provision is likely strategic to codify it as an anterior process to a position based condition.

2613
04:46:04,090 --> 04:46:12,112
[SPEAKER_12]: I also had a point of clarification that echoes your concern, President Bares, over the timelines for initiatives versus referenda.

2614
04:46:13,312 --> 04:46:29,937
[SPEAKER_12]: Both can and should be considered to require the same public education period towards respective motions to gather the necessary signatures, and I'm still a little confused as to why the proposing body would indicate that they would be different.

2615
04:46:30,997 --> 04:46:31,257
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

2616
04:46:32,757 --> 04:46:33,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Zachary.

2617
04:46:35,199 --> 04:46:39,803
[SPEAKER_09]: I will hold on that just to allow Gaston to speak as well.

2618
04:46:42,585 --> 04:46:43,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Give you one sec, Gaston.

2619
04:46:46,268 --> 04:46:47,589
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.

2620
04:46:47,609 --> 04:46:48,630
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, Chair Tsang.

2621
04:46:48,870 --> 04:46:51,212
[SPEAKER_32]: Gaston Fiore, 61 Stigney Road.

2622
04:46:51,652 --> 04:46:58,818
[SPEAKER_32]: I just got a question regarding section A3, Citizen Referendum Procedures, subsection A. So in the first paragraph,

2623
04:46:59,442 --> 04:47:08,867
[SPEAKER_32]: So it says no more than 21 days, et cetera, after the city council, for example, has voted finally to approve of a measure.

2624
04:47:09,327 --> 04:47:16,670
[SPEAKER_32]: So my question is, so right now for ordinances, or for most ordinances at least, we have the reading periods.

2625
04:47:17,531 --> 04:47:27,696
[SPEAKER_32]: So these 21 days means the day of voting, which could potentially mean that we wouldn't even have reached the third reading of a particular ordinance, and then the 21 days

2626
04:47:28,964 --> 04:47:29,965
[SPEAKER_32]: could be exhausted.

2627
04:47:30,465 --> 04:47:48,398
[SPEAKER_32]: So to me, there's some contradiction here where, you know, we give the public sort of like three readings to try to learn the audience, although in practice, we know that no one reads anything because that gets published in some sort of a newspaper that it's in the 7-Eleven that no one even can find.

2628
04:47:49,839 --> 04:47:54,963
[SPEAKER_32]: But theoretically, if this audience was actually published somewhere that the public could actually read,

2629
04:47:56,273 --> 04:48:03,397
[SPEAKER_32]: it could mean that we wouldn't even have reached the third reading and we would have reached the 21 days.

2630
04:48:04,218 --> 04:48:06,259
[SPEAKER_32]: So there's kind of an inconsistency.

2631
04:48:06,279 --> 04:48:14,224
[SPEAKER_32]: So I don't know where we should alter this to say 21 days after the third reading or how I'm not an expert in these issues, but I just wanted to point that out.

2632
04:48:14,244 --> 04:48:14,544
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

2633
04:48:15,785 --> 04:48:17,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Gaston.

2634
04:48:17,246 --> 04:48:19,487
[SPEAKER_09]: The call center could correct me.

2635
04:48:19,627 --> 04:48:24,590
[SPEAKER_09]: My understanding is that by putting the word finally in there, it suggests that it's the third reading.

2636
04:48:25,778 --> 04:48:28,299
[SPEAKER_09]: The call center's reps are nodding their heads.

2637
04:48:28,899 --> 04:48:32,020
[SPEAKER_09]: So I hope that answers your question, your concern, Gaston.

2638
04:48:36,082 --> 04:48:41,644
[SPEAKER_09]: We have, are there any other members of our community seeking to participate?

2639
04:48:43,187 --> 04:48:43,627
[SPEAKER_09]: make comment?

2640
04:48:43,767 --> 04:48:44,327
[SPEAKER_09]: No, none.

2641
04:48:44,788 --> 04:48:59,652
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess there is, I wanted to ask once again to really understand why the timelines for citizen referendums and citizen initiatives should be different.

2642
04:49:00,193 --> 04:49:01,593
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the question that Zachary had.

2643
04:49:02,133 --> 04:49:03,954
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not completely clear to me.

2644
04:49:03,994 --> 04:49:05,995
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I started to get a few hints of it.

2645
04:49:06,015 --> 04:49:06,695
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was wondering if

2646
04:49:07,588 --> 04:49:16,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Just once more, someone from the Collins Center or Chair McDonald, you could explain to me why the timelines for those two things should be different.

2647
04:49:16,873 --> 04:49:36,845
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the only point I can make is that the initiative is something that no one's ever seen before.

2648
04:49:39,137 --> 04:49:40,638
[SPEAKER_15]: or never seen it in that form.

2649
04:49:42,299 --> 04:49:55,267
[SPEAKER_15]: And the people who are putting that forward have to go out and explain this to people, and explain why they need a petition, and what the effect of it will be.

2650
04:49:55,307 --> 04:49:58,909
[SPEAKER_15]: And if it's just in the state, it's just one thing.

2651
04:49:58,929 --> 04:50:01,830
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a public education problem.

2652
04:50:01,870 --> 04:50:06,033
[SPEAKER_15]: There are a number of them.

2653
04:50:19,233 --> 04:50:27,617
the delays, potentially delaying somebody, some other community.

2654
04:50:29,158 --> 04:50:32,140
[SPEAKER_14]: And so, therefore,

2655
04:50:40,960 --> 04:50:56,990
[SPEAKER_09]: So would I be right in saying that the main difference is the public education, the need for public education on an item that the assumption is that if if it's something the city council has passed or done, for example, that's something that the public would have already had exposure to.

2656
04:50:57,010 --> 04:51:01,273
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the main crux.

2657
04:51:02,313 --> 04:51:02,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2658
04:51:02,934 --> 04:51:03,454
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I think

2659
04:51:05,247 --> 04:51:10,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think that it's helpful to hear after a longer discussion about everything else.

2660
04:51:10,909 --> 04:51:26,053
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that point is clear to me, although the logical argument seems to really hinge on this idea that there is a different need for public education in both and between

2661
04:51:36,472 --> 04:51:45,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you, yeah.

2662
04:51:46,876 --> 04:51:51,157
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I see Matthew Page Lieberman has his hand raised.

2663
04:51:51,237 --> 04:51:53,398
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna ask you to unmute, you have three minutes.

2664
04:52:00,695 --> 04:52:01,296
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't.

2665
04:52:01,436 --> 04:52:02,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

2666
04:52:03,177 --> 04:52:03,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Justin, please.

2667
04:52:04,018 --> 04:52:07,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you please have the folks from the call-in center speak into the microphone?

2668
04:52:08,882 --> 04:52:10,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I really cannot hear.

2669
04:52:10,223 --> 04:52:10,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2670
04:52:12,705 --> 04:52:13,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.

2671
04:52:15,967 --> 04:52:17,889
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I more or less summarized what you said.

2672
04:52:19,370 --> 04:52:22,233
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't think folks from at home missed it too much.

2673
04:52:23,053 --> 04:52:25,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Ghassan, I'm going to recognize you for one minute.

2674
04:52:29,365 --> 04:52:32,127
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm very sorry, I forgot about something.

2675
04:52:32,267 --> 04:52:38,552
[SPEAKER_32]: I wonder whether this is the time to actually address where ordinances get published.

2676
04:52:39,052 --> 04:52:45,817
[SPEAKER_32]: So instead of having them published in that newspaper that has to be a physical copy in a 7-Eleven that no one can ever find.

2677
04:52:47,349 --> 04:53:04,744
[SPEAKER_32]: Is the charter the place where we should address that and state where ordinances should be published somewhere online or somewhere that the city can actually push out to residents so they actually get to know because I do agree with

2678
04:53:05,981 --> 04:53:08,604
[SPEAKER_32]: the experts from the calling center that it should be different.

2679
04:53:09,645 --> 04:53:18,454
[SPEAKER_32]: But in practice, I actually don't know how different it is because as we all know, probably most people don't know about what happens at the city council.

2680
04:53:19,295 --> 04:53:23,700
[SPEAKER_32]: So if that could address, that could be addressed via the city charter, I think that would be great.

2681
04:53:23,740 --> 04:53:24,240
[SPEAKER_32]: Thanks so much.

2682
04:53:25,198 --> 04:53:25,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2683
04:53:25,598 --> 04:53:34,522
[SPEAKER_09]: I could be, correct me if I got this wrong, where we had a lengthy-ish discussion about this at our first substantive meeting.

2684
04:53:35,002 --> 04:53:45,587
[SPEAKER_09]: It seemed like what we landed on was that the language in the charter reflects state law with regards to publishing that information, getting that posted.

2685
04:53:45,967 --> 04:53:46,948
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen odds in the audience.

2686
04:53:49,987 --> 04:54:01,911
[SPEAKER_09]: We had talked at that meeting about some other alternatives, but it seems like it might overcomplicate the requirements for getting laws passed.

2687
04:54:02,171 --> 04:54:11,314
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that's the reason why it wasn't recommended that we amend that and why the governance committee chose not to amend it.

2688
04:54:13,664 --> 04:54:15,186
[SPEAKER_09]: I see no more public comment.

2689
04:54:16,748 --> 04:54:18,991
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a few motions on the floor.

2690
04:54:21,254 --> 04:54:24,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Should we run through them very quickly once more?

2691
04:54:24,638 --> 04:54:26,280
[SPEAKER_09]: And we need seconds for these motions as well.

2692
04:54:59,399 --> 04:55:00,764
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that motion would also.

2693
04:55:40,120 --> 04:55:51,143
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, finally, the third motion is to edit the recalibration to apply it to the position.

2694
04:55:51,203 --> 04:55:52,164
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, three motions.

2695
04:55:56,825 --> 04:56:01,506
[SPEAKER_09]: I do have a quick comment on the first.

2696
04:56:01,966 --> 04:56:04,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me just remind myself what it was.

2697
04:56:04,327 --> 04:56:05,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Threshold.

2698
04:56:05,607 --> 04:56:06,148
[SPEAKER_09]: The threshold.

2699
04:56:10,385 --> 04:56:18,992
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I think something that we'll have to do at the committee, the whole meeting is to adjust the definition for a new initiative as well.

2700
04:56:19,153 --> 04:56:23,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the current definition in there is very broad and allows for appeal things too.

2701
04:56:24,237 --> 04:56:31,403
[SPEAKER_09]: So at least in my understanding, reading the definitions for initiative right now.

2702
04:56:31,623 --> 04:56:33,424
[SPEAKER_09]: just so I can see it, where is that?

2703
04:56:34,044 --> 04:56:36,825
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on page three, it's number 11.

2704
04:56:37,625 --> 04:56:44,247
[SPEAKER_09]: It says initiative measure, a measure proposed by the voters through the initiative process provided under this charter.

2705
04:56:44,387 --> 04:56:56,872
[SPEAKER_09]: But because our definition for measure is very broad, I think anyone could really argue that, you know, you put a negative measure on the ballot, that also counts as a measure on the ballot.

2706
04:57:02,043 --> 04:57:04,264
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, 8-4 is not exhaustive.

2707
04:57:05,645 --> 04:57:12,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Or, well, it will be read as exhaustive, but it's not a truly exhaustive list of what we would be doing as a city council.

2708
04:57:12,767 --> 04:57:14,948
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe it, but if you want to make an amendment here now.

2709
04:57:15,828 --> 04:57:17,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, well, I can't make an amendment.

2710
04:57:17,249 --> 04:57:19,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, if you have a suggestion.

2711
04:57:19,410 --> 04:57:20,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I don't have a suggestion right now.

2712
04:57:20,730 --> 04:57:21,911
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's something we'd have to look at.

2713
04:57:22,191 --> 04:57:22,491
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2714
04:57:27,593 --> 04:57:29,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so we have three motions.

2715
04:57:29,193 --> 04:57:30,634
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have seconds for those motions?

2716
04:57:32,552 --> 04:57:34,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, are you seconding?

2717
04:57:34,994 --> 04:57:48,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool, on the first motion on thresholds for the citizen initiative and the citizen referendums.

2718
04:57:49,284 --> 04:57:52,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion by President Behrs, seconded by Councilor Lazaro.

2719
04:57:53,046 --> 04:57:54,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, may you please pull the roll?

2720
04:57:56,008 --> 04:57:56,989
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Collins.

2721
04:57:58,210 --> 04:57:58,450
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2722
04:58:00,331 --> 04:58:01,012
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Lazaro.

2723
04:58:02,880 --> 04:58:08,863
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilors Capelli, President Beers, Chairman Singh.

2724
04:58:09,103 --> 04:58:11,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, four in favor, none opposed, motion passes.

2725
04:58:12,204 --> 04:58:13,064
[SPEAKER_09]: One opposed.

2726
04:58:13,285 --> 04:58:14,645
[SPEAKER_09]: One opposed, motion passes.

2727
04:58:16,206 --> 04:58:27,831
[SPEAKER_09]: On the second motion from President Beers on the amendments to 8-4 ineligible measures, seconded by Councilor Zara.

2728
04:58:28,791 --> 04:58:30,052
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please.

2729
04:58:34,737 --> 04:58:35,697
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Collins?

2730
04:58:36,218 --> 04:58:36,438
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2731
04:58:39,299 --> 04:58:39,979
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Zaro?

2732
04:58:40,019 --> 04:58:40,119
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2733
04:58:42,860 --> 04:58:43,660
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2734
04:58:43,680 --> 04:58:43,740
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

2735
04:58:45,641 --> 04:58:46,301
[SPEAKER_21]: President Beers?

2736
04:58:46,541 --> 04:58:46,741
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2737
04:58:48,222 --> 04:58:48,782
[SPEAKER_21]: Chairman Singh?

2738
04:58:49,042 --> 04:58:49,282
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2739
04:58:49,582 --> 04:58:51,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Four in favor, one opposed, motion passes.

2740
04:58:52,143 --> 04:59:00,146
[SPEAKER_09]: On the third motion from President Beers to amend the recall process to apply only to the mayor's office, seconded by Councilor Zaro.

2741
04:59:00,446 --> 04:59:01,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please.

2742
04:59:03,588 --> 04:59:04,488
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Collins?

2743
04:59:06,633 --> 04:59:06,873
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2744
04:59:09,054 --> 04:59:09,714
[SPEAKER_21]: Council Bizarro?

2745
04:59:09,734 --> 04:59:09,834
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

2746
04:59:13,895 --> 04:59:14,715
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Scapelli?

2747
04:59:15,255 --> 04:59:15,375
No.

2748
04:59:16,776 --> 04:59:17,436
[SPEAKER_21]: President Pierce?

2749
04:59:17,696 --> 04:59:17,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2750
04:59:19,237 --> 04:59:19,777
[SPEAKER_21]: Chairman Singh?

2751
04:59:20,017 --> 04:59:20,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2752
04:59:20,417 --> 04:59:22,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Three in favor, two opposed, motion passes.

2753
04:59:24,098 --> 04:59:26,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's take article nine altogether.

2754
04:59:26,459 --> 04:59:30,180
[SPEAKER_09]: I do have some comments from, short comments from school committee members.

2755
04:59:30,820 --> 04:59:32,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any comments from city councilors?

2756
04:59:33,301 --> 04:59:34,381
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll clear the mic deck too.

2757
04:59:39,930 --> 04:59:42,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing no comments from city councilors.

2758
04:59:45,334 --> 04:59:50,278
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll read the comments from from members of the school committee.

2759
04:59:51,899 --> 04:59:57,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice Chair, Vice Chair Graham says on section nine dash five representation of the school committee.

2760
04:59:59,771 --> 05:00:06,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Finally, it is imperative that Section 9-5 includes equal representation from the school committee, as we are the third branch of government in Medford.

2761
05:00:07,036 --> 05:00:15,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Our role in overseeing the education of Medford's children is of utmost importance, and we must have a voice in any decisions that impact the functioning of the city as a whole.

2762
05:00:15,841 --> 05:00:25,487
[SPEAKER_09]: As an independent governing body with direct responsibility for the education and well-being of our students, it is critical that the school committee is adequately represented in these discussions.

2763
05:00:26,080 --> 05:00:32,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Many of the items and issues I outlined in this memo could have been avoided with school committee representation during the development process.

2764
05:00:35,706 --> 05:00:42,971
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the comments I have from Member Russo.

2765
05:00:44,572 --> 05:01:01,623
[SPEAKER_09]: On the same section on the periodic review of the charter, he suggests a change from five appointees of the mayor, three appointees of the city council president, one appointee by the school committee vice chair, to three appointees of the mayor, three appointees of the city council, and three appointees of the school committee.

2766
05:01:02,523 --> 05:01:08,205
[SPEAKER_09]: His rationale is that the school committee is a co-equal branch of government according to the organizational chart.

2767
05:01:08,765 --> 05:01:14,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Additionally, this council president and school committee vice chair or chair, if not the mayor, should not hold such power.

2768
05:01:14,527 --> 05:01:16,288
[SPEAKER_09]: These individuals are servants of the body.

2769
05:01:16,808 --> 05:01:24,531
[SPEAKER_09]: These not to run the show, dictate policy or make unilateral decisions.

2770
05:01:24,651 --> 05:01:29,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Decision-making authority should only be exercised by these leaders if explicitly authorized by the body.

2771
05:01:32,335 --> 05:01:43,043
[SPEAKER_09]: He also notes that in this section of the charter, there's no provision for the replacement of members, whether they voluntarily leave or are asked to leave by a majority vote of the charter committee.

2772
05:01:45,065 --> 05:01:54,332
[SPEAKER_09]: He also suggests striking the sentence appointing the mayor as chair of the special committee, saying that the chair is a servant of the body.

2773
05:01:54,372 --> 05:01:59,717
[SPEAKER_09]: And in this case, the charter review committee should select their own chair and be able to replace said chair as they see fit.

2774
05:02:00,177 --> 05:02:02,358
[SPEAKER_09]: No one person should appoint a chair ever.

2775
05:02:05,720 --> 05:02:15,305
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that is all that applies on section, on article nine from the full committee members.

2776
05:02:15,805 --> 05:02:16,406
[SPEAKER_09]: President Beresford.

2777
05:02:31,415 --> 05:02:43,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so just for convenience, comment 25 from... I would propose that we adopt that amendment.

2778
05:02:45,360 --> 05:02:56,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, it's telling me that you can't be heard, so I'm just gonna turn your thing on.

2779
05:02:56,064 --> 05:02:56,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I'm...

2780
05:03:00,606 --> 05:03:01,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Not usually my issue.

2781
05:03:02,573 --> 05:03:03,195
[SPEAKER_06]: You should be good now.

2782
05:03:03,616 --> 05:03:03,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

2783
05:03:08,452 --> 05:03:11,874
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would propose adopting comment 25 and making that change.

2784
05:03:12,554 --> 05:03:16,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, we have a motion from President Bearer, seconded by Councilor Zara.

2785
05:03:16,936 --> 05:03:18,117
[SPEAKER_09]: I wasn't quite done.

2786
05:03:18,137 --> 05:03:24,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Zara was very excited for this.

2787
05:03:24,420 --> 05:03:37,247
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would further move that we request that the call-in center just draft language to add that the original appointing authority will appoint a replacement in case of a vacancy.

2788
05:03:39,671 --> 05:03:42,353
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I do have, I'll leave it.

2789
05:03:42,774 --> 05:03:42,994
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

2790
05:03:46,857 --> 05:03:49,419
[SPEAKER_09]: So we, Council is still seconding that.

2791
05:03:50,060 --> 05:03:56,165
[SPEAKER_09]: I did have, I wanted to take all the motions on article nine at the same time.

2792
05:03:56,185 --> 05:04:01,369
[SPEAKER_09]: I just had a question for the body because I think this committee might have a better idea.

2793
05:04:02,170 --> 05:04:06,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Section 9-7 about the uniform procedures governing multiple body.

2794
05:04:07,534 --> 05:04:08,655
[SPEAKER_09]: multiple member bodies.

2795
05:04:10,435 --> 05:04:20,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Essentially, it dictates that MMBs, so multiple member bodies, should elect a chair, vice chair, and a secretary, and any other officers it deems necessary.

2796
05:04:20,179 --> 05:04:26,641
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's fine, but are there any bodies that have different structures by ordinance that we're aware of?

2797
05:04:35,324 --> 05:04:36,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Would it, I guess,

2798
05:04:38,197 --> 05:04:40,077
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe this is a question for the Collins Center.

2799
05:04:41,538 --> 05:04:53,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Should we add in an amendment to make it clear that if there's a law, like a mass general law dictating otherwise, that that should govern?

2800
05:04:53,681 --> 05:05:04,283
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, I guess there's a similar question for Part B. Yeah, maybe you want this reference to the general laws.

2801
05:05:05,047 --> 05:05:05,408
[SPEAKER_09]: 9-7.

2802
05:05:05,908 --> 05:05:06,468
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

2803
05:05:07,749 --> 05:05:11,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Point A is about the structure, so the structure of these multiple member bodies.

2804
05:05:12,273 --> 05:05:18,178
[SPEAKER_09]: And then point B, about how often they meet and these kind of more logistical things.

2805
05:05:19,019 --> 05:05:29,567
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just worried that there might be some oversight where there's like an MGL body that has different rules, or MGL authorized body that has different rules for these things, or even by ordinance.

2806
05:05:29,747 --> 05:05:30,147
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, no.

2807
05:05:30,748 --> 05:05:30,828
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

2808
05:05:32,766 --> 05:05:33,847
[SPEAKER_09]: They all follow the structure?

2809
05:05:33,987 --> 05:05:34,267
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2810
05:05:34,708 --> 05:05:36,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2811
05:05:37,229 --> 05:05:42,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, what do you mean they all follow the structure?

2812
05:05:42,293 --> 05:05:50,698
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like the sense I got there was that some state agency was going to tell you how to run

2813
05:05:51,757 --> 05:06:02,065
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think this goes back to a question I asked, I think, at our second meeting, which was, we have a button, our traffic commission is created by a special act.

2814
05:06:02,305 --> 05:06:02,526
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

2815
05:06:02,926 --> 05:06:07,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Our community development board, a special act, a couple, maybe one or two others.

2816
05:06:08,570 --> 05:06:10,392
[SPEAKER_06]: I might be wrong and those might just be the only two.

2817
05:06:10,412 --> 05:06:13,414
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the only two I found.

2818
05:06:13,634 --> 05:06:13,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2819
05:06:14,435 --> 05:06:20,720
[SPEAKER_06]: So would this overrule the structure as defined by special act for those bodies?

2820
05:06:21,198 --> 05:06:22,539
[SPEAKER_15]: No, the special act always rules.

2821
05:06:22,880 --> 05:06:23,921
[SPEAKER_06]: The special acts always rule.

2822
05:06:24,041 --> 05:06:24,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2823
05:06:24,842 --> 05:06:31,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and are we, are we going to have a conversation at our committee of the whole about the different special acts governing Medford?

2824
05:06:31,729 --> 05:06:34,072
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you said you were kind of pulling together a list there.

2825
05:06:35,273 --> 05:06:38,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that, are we going to, I want to, I would be great to incorporate that some way into a draft charter.

2826
05:06:39,955 --> 05:06:42,776
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you're not going to need very much.

2827
05:06:43,256 --> 05:06:50,858
[SPEAKER_15]: In Article 10, it references the appeal of Chapter 650.

2828
05:06:52,658 --> 05:07:09,322
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we'll make a reference to the retention of the 1958 Act as amended by the 2014 Act for the Traffic Commission and the 1974 Act for the Community Development Department are specifically retained until the city takes action under Article 5.

2829
05:07:10,007 --> 05:07:10,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2830
05:07:11,128 --> 05:07:12,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Under article five of this charter.

2831
05:07:12,709 --> 05:07:12,909
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

2832
05:07:14,410 --> 05:07:23,355
[SPEAKER_06]: So article five, and now we're going down a rabbit hole that maybe we shouldn't have, but, um, so under article five, the city could.

2833
05:07:26,637 --> 05:07:29,259
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me, I'll just, can I just, yeah, go ahead.

2834
05:07:29,559 --> 05:07:39,585
[SPEAKER_15]: So once we say that, once that's in the charter that you can do this under article five, then you can make any change you want to make in the traffic commission

2835
05:07:40,177 --> 05:07:44,421
[SPEAKER_15]: or the community development department locally, you don't have to go back and amend the special act.

2836
05:07:44,701 --> 05:07:45,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2837
05:07:46,022 --> 05:07:50,466
[SPEAKER_15]: See the, if you wanted to like change the membership or expand the membership.

2838
05:07:54,510 --> 05:07:57,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would it be under article five and not by ordinance?

2839
05:07:58,353 --> 05:08:00,855
[SPEAKER_15]: Because you need an administrative code in order to be able to do this.

2840
05:08:01,476 --> 05:08:01,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2841
05:08:01,856 --> 05:08:03,718
[SPEAKER_15]: They have to be in the administrative code.

2842
05:08:07,204 --> 05:08:10,626
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't do it by ordinance because the ordinance is derivative of the special act.

2843
05:08:11,086 --> 05:08:15,049
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you were going to change anything in the special act, you'd have to amend the special act.

2844
05:08:15,649 --> 05:08:22,454
[SPEAKER_15]: If you have an administrative code that's already been adopted, then you can do it in the code.

2845
05:08:25,075 --> 05:08:27,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we're getting into some third order stuff here.

2846
05:08:30,579 --> 05:08:33,220
[SPEAKER_06]: But so the code isn't controlled by the ordinance?

2847
05:08:38,693 --> 05:08:43,397
[SPEAKER_15]: the code sort of replaces or refined some of your ordinances.

2848
05:08:43,657 --> 05:08:43,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2849
05:08:43,857 --> 05:08:45,198
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2850
05:08:45,218 --> 05:08:46,599
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have to have this conversation right now.

2851
05:08:46,639 --> 05:08:47,800
[SPEAKER_06]: We can have it in a couple of weeks.

2852
05:08:48,160 --> 05:08:49,461
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate the clarification.

2853
05:08:49,481 --> 05:08:54,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Are those the only special acts right now that you found that are going to continue?

2854
05:08:54,445 --> 05:08:56,747
[SPEAKER_15]: That represent what's called the charter level action?

2855
05:08:56,787 --> 05:08:57,007
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2856
05:08:57,367 --> 05:08:58,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great.

2857
05:08:58,088 --> 05:08:58,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2858
05:08:58,963 --> 05:08:59,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2859
05:09:00,024 --> 05:09:00,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2860
05:09:01,164 --> 05:09:14,672
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, as we're going through this, maybe my friends from the call center, I know we talked about in previous meetings that when we're talking about boards and commissions that we wanted to see that they had to be method residents.

2861
05:09:14,832 --> 05:09:16,113
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that in the section or?

2862
05:09:16,373 --> 05:09:18,535
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah.

2863
05:09:18,595 --> 05:09:21,156
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, no, we should put that in the appointment section.

2864
05:09:21,176 --> 05:09:22,417
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, if we can.

2865
05:09:22,437 --> 05:09:24,238
[SPEAKER_15]: The mayoral appointment section.

2866
05:09:24,565 --> 05:09:27,446
[SPEAKER_20]: Right, so if we can make that a formal motion to make sure we add.

2867
05:09:27,606 --> 05:09:31,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we'll make sure we add it before the committee.

2868
05:09:31,507 --> 05:09:32,688
[SPEAKER_09]: We already passed a motion on that.

2869
05:09:33,208 --> 05:09:34,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2870
05:09:34,028 --> 05:09:40,831
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, yeah, I think, I think we, oh, the reason why we don't have it in front of us today is we passed the motion to have it at the committee level.

2871
05:09:40,931 --> 05:09:41,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

2872
05:09:43,411 --> 05:09:44,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, great.

2873
05:09:44,692 --> 05:09:45,552
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Zahra.

2874
05:09:46,793 --> 05:09:53,555
[SPEAKER_26]: This is an extremely tiny edit, but section 911 has, it references a city clerk elect.

2875
05:09:54,529 --> 05:09:56,510
[SPEAKER_14]: which is not elected.

2876
05:09:57,070 --> 05:09:58,431
[SPEAKER_26]: Have we already talked about that?

2877
05:09:58,991 --> 05:10:01,453
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I mean, it was mentioned before.

2878
05:10:01,653 --> 05:10:02,093
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, okay.

2879
05:10:02,113 --> 05:10:03,994
[SPEAKER_26]: So that'll just be removed.

2880
05:10:04,254 --> 05:10:04,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2881
05:10:04,755 --> 05:10:05,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great.

2882
05:10:05,795 --> 05:10:07,576
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, thank you.

2883
05:10:07,856 --> 05:10:09,717
[SPEAKER_15]: It was disbarred from another charter.

2884
05:10:11,258 --> 05:10:18,262
[SPEAKER_06]: I did have one thing on... Member Rousseau submitted some comments on section one.

2885
05:10:19,095 --> 05:10:19,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2886
05:10:19,716 --> 05:10:20,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2887
05:10:20,356 --> 05:10:21,657
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also had one thing on section 10.

2888
05:10:22,337 --> 05:10:23,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2889
05:10:24,019 --> 05:10:25,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2890
05:10:27,021 --> 05:10:29,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let's, let's finish article nine.

2891
05:10:30,023 --> 05:10:31,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Do article 10 in bulk.

2892
05:10:31,484 --> 05:10:35,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Go to take the one thing really article one thing really quickly.

2893
05:10:35,847 --> 05:10:43,213
[SPEAKER_09]: And then is there any further comment from counselors on article nine comments from public?

2894
05:10:43,753 --> 05:10:45,094
[SPEAKER_09]: I see Matthew Page Lieberman.

2895
05:10:45,114 --> 05:10:46,435
[SPEAKER_09]: You have three minutes.

2896
05:10:52,221 --> 05:10:53,723
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to thank the council.

2897
05:10:54,243 --> 05:11:04,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, I know sometimes, you know, council people in the council get criticized, but I felt that, you know, tonight was a very good example where you can see people, members are listening and contemplating.

2898
05:11:05,893 --> 05:11:16,622
[SPEAKER_02]: I think regarding this thing about the leadership structure of the council, there used to, these boards and commissions, there used to be a commission that decided that they preferred two co-chairs.

2899
05:11:17,600 --> 05:11:33,491
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that there is a way I mean to address these kinds of concerns, just I guess what we're talking about 978 that it should have like a chair, a vice chair and a secretary, unless established you know differently by the ordinance of that I think I think that would be nice to have.

2900
05:11:34,472 --> 05:11:39,176
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, kind of shared leadership and stuff like that, and give boards and commissions that freedom.

2901
05:11:39,717 --> 05:11:48,105
[SPEAKER_02]: But just, I noticed something that's not in the report, and it's not in the charter, which is referring to meeting recordings, audio recordings, video recordings.

2902
05:11:48,785 --> 05:11:51,948
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that they're not actually the official record, the minutes of the record.

2903
05:11:52,509 --> 05:11:55,152
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that kind of like brings us to this big, big question of

2904
05:11:56,330 --> 05:11:59,872
[SPEAKER_02]: really pertinent question of how did the minutes get on the city website.

2905
05:12:00,253 --> 05:12:02,194
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, a few of you all I've talked to privately.

2906
05:12:02,934 --> 05:12:10,519
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that there's one particular commission, they haven't put their minutes up there since 2020 onto the website, the liaison just refuses to do that.

2907
05:12:11,200 --> 05:12:15,622
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it makes sense to have rules be left up to these commissions.

2908
05:12:15,662 --> 05:12:16,303
[SPEAKER_02]: But the question is,

2909
05:12:17,040 --> 05:12:20,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Who is it the responsibility to put the electronic minutes up there?

2910
05:12:20,641 --> 05:12:22,422
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it should definitely be in the charter.

2911
05:12:22,442 --> 05:12:24,123
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the responsibility of the secretary.

2912
05:12:24,543 --> 05:12:27,844
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't see any reason why we should make that flexible.

2913
05:12:28,845 --> 05:12:31,326
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just basically it.

2914
05:12:31,446 --> 05:12:35,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps in committee the whole people could talk about the recordings, but I think you should really, really nail that down.

2915
05:12:35,887 --> 05:12:41,910
[SPEAKER_02]: So we never have a problem again, like has existed with one where the minutes have not been put up for the past five years.

2916
05:12:42,010 --> 05:12:42,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

2917
05:12:44,480 --> 05:12:45,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Matthew.

2918
05:12:45,221 --> 05:12:47,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any further comments from the public?

2919
05:12:48,762 --> 05:12:58,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, to really quickly answer your question, Matthew, Section 9-7 would standardize the process to get those minutes on the website.

2920
05:12:58,587 --> 05:13:05,091
[SPEAKER_09]: I know the problem that you're referring to, and part of it is because we don't have a standardized process right now.

2921
05:13:06,291 --> 05:13:06,972
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a motion

2922
05:13:07,663 --> 05:13:17,248
[SPEAKER_09]: from President Beers on amendments to 9-5, seconded by Councilor Zaro.

2923
05:13:17,788 --> 05:13:19,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, whenever you're ready.

2924
05:13:22,951 --> 05:13:23,891
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Collins.

2925
05:13:27,433 --> 05:13:27,713
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2926
05:13:30,435 --> 05:13:31,255
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Zaro.

2927
05:13:31,675 --> 05:13:31,835
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

2928
05:13:33,436 --> 05:13:34,177
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Scapelli.

2929
05:13:34,197 --> 05:13:34,257
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

2930
05:13:36,258 --> 05:13:36,838
[SPEAKER_21]: President Beers.

2931
05:13:37,613 --> 05:13:37,693
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

2932
05:13:38,854 --> 05:13:39,895
[SPEAKER_21]: Chairman saying yes.

2933
05:13:40,215 --> 05:13:42,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Four in favor, one opposed motion passes.

2934
05:13:43,157 --> 05:13:44,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any comments on article 10?

2935
05:13:44,738 --> 05:13:47,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Councillor Behrs.

2936
05:13:48,421 --> 05:13:52,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Chair saying my one comment is in section 10-6.

2937
05:13:52,383 --> 05:13:54,685
[SPEAKER_06]: An Oscar and Emmy.

2938
05:14:08,471 --> 05:14:28,156
[SPEAKER_06]: 10-6 it says the time of taking effect the mayor will be elected to a four-year term November 2nd 2027 council composition new council be November 2nd should there also be a line school committee it doesn't say when this takes effect for the school committee oh yeah we can add that all right great thank you uh yeah well there is also just one thing

2939
05:14:29,030 --> 05:14:41,100
[SPEAKER_09]: To note for the Committee of the Whole, the City Council number of members thing, it's a clerical thing, but once we decide, once we make a final recommendation of the Committee of the Whole meeting, we should look to address that number.

2940
05:14:42,141 --> 05:14:50,048
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, Councilor Behrs, you mentioned an amendment for, to session one?

2941
05:14:50,648 --> 05:14:55,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just, I would adopt member Russo's comments two, three, four, and five.

2942
05:14:55,472 --> 05:14:56,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2943
05:14:56,860 --> 05:14:58,962
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go through them very, very quickly.

2944
05:15:01,284 --> 05:15:05,767
[SPEAKER_09]: But essentially the gist of them, if I remember- They're school committee related definitions.

2945
05:15:05,907 --> 05:15:06,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, right, right, right.

2946
05:15:10,010 --> 05:15:11,472
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the motion from President Behrs.

2947
05:15:11,492 --> 05:15:12,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have a second?

2948
05:15:16,315 --> 05:15:18,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Zara?

2949
05:15:18,897 --> 05:15:20,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you second President Behrs' motion?

2950
05:15:22,000 --> 05:15:23,281
[SPEAKER_06]: They are, I'll read them.

2951
05:15:26,901 --> 05:15:56,042
[SPEAKER_06]: It is changing the definition of city agency to not include the Medford public schools, changing city officer department head to not include the Medford public schools, city website to not include the Medford public schools and exclude an advisory, add the language or the school committee to the words or an advisory committee appointed by the mayor or the school committee.

2952
05:15:56,980 --> 05:15:57,841
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, second.

2953
05:16:00,062 --> 05:16:01,564
[SPEAKER_09]: That's comments 2 to 5, right?

2954
05:16:01,584 --> 05:16:01,844
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

2955
05:16:04,566 --> 05:16:05,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Comments 2 to 5.

2956
05:16:07,208 --> 05:16:07,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, what?

05:16:08,209 --> 05:16:09,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that comments 2 to 5?

2958
05:16:10,670 --> 05:16:11,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, comments 2 through 5.

2959
05:16:14,053 --> 05:16:16,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there any public comments on those sections?

2960
05:16:18,788 --> 05:16:31,657
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, seeing no request from councilors, Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, we have a motion to accept comments to the by from member Rousseau, seconded by Councilor Zahra.

[SPEAKER_09]: Four in favor, one opposed, motion passes.

2972
05:16:54,786 --> 05:16:58,448
[SPEAKER_09]: The very last thing we have tonight are the three compensation provisions.

2973
05:16:59,749 --> 05:17:02,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have any comment from councilors on this?

2974
05:17:04,511 --> 05:17:09,494
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I ever introduced them, which I'm happy to read my memorandum if that's helpful.

2975
05:17:09,874 --> 05:17:12,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, if you could remind us real quick.

2976
05:17:25,178 --> 05:17:28,220
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a proposed amendment to compensation of elected officials.

2977
05:17:29,281 --> 05:17:40,687
[SPEAKER_06]: This would set the compensation of the mayor, city council, and school committee by charter, eliminate the authority of the city council to set compensation and have a maximum increase of 2% per year.

2978
05:17:40,707 --> 05:17:52,795
[SPEAKER_06]: It would end perceived conflict of interest because no elected official would be able to set their own pay or the pay of fellow elected officials at any point, even after the following election.

2979
05:17:54,463 --> 05:18:03,006
[SPEAKER_06]: this would establish a maximum increase of 2% per year with a smaller increase if the city's key department heads did not receive an increase of at least 2% per year.

2980
05:18:04,766 --> 05:18:16,270
[SPEAKER_06]: And it would make this a charter issue, essentially that the scheme could only be amended by a charter amendment approved by the voters.

2981
05:18:17,610 --> 05:18:19,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2982
05:18:20,091 --> 05:18:22,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have any comments from other councilors?

2983
05:18:23,620 --> 05:18:25,041
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can get into more specifics too.

2984
05:18:25,061 --> 05:18:26,222
[SPEAKER_06]: That was just the general summary.

2985
05:18:26,642 --> 05:18:49,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I think if you don't mind, counselor saying to find my red line version here, but in general, um, I think one thing we've heard in the past is that folks don't understand why the mayor is compensated for the office of the mayor and the office of the school committee.

2986
05:18:49,901 --> 05:18:52,783
[SPEAKER_06]: And so this would say that the mayor's compensated just for being the mayor.

2987
05:18:55,139 --> 05:19:05,922
[SPEAKER_06]: But it would set that rate at $160,000 a year, which is pretty much what the mayor's making now, certainly with inflation in the next three years, what the mayor would be making at that point.

2988
05:19:07,223 --> 05:19:13,945
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it sets the council and school committee members and officers as a percentage of the mayor's salary.

2989
05:19:13,965 --> 05:19:21,727
[SPEAKER_06]: 20% for members, 25% for officers, if I recall correctly my proposal.

2990
05:19:24,613 --> 05:19:25,954
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's just generally the proposal.

2991
05:19:26,034 --> 05:19:30,856
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, you know, again, this would be in the charter, it would have to be approved by the voters as part of the charter.

2992
05:19:32,897 --> 05:19:37,519
[SPEAKER_06]: The charter study committee proposal was to have a committee make recommendations.

2993
05:19:37,559 --> 05:19:40,280
[SPEAKER_06]: And then again, the council would vote on those recommendations.

2994
05:19:42,041 --> 05:19:45,903
[SPEAKER_06]: And they would go into effect after the following election for each office.

2995
05:19:45,923 --> 05:19:45,943
[SPEAKER_06]: I

2996
05:19:49,865 --> 05:19:52,427
[SPEAKER_06]: don't think it addresses kind of one of the core conflicts.

2997
05:19:52,447 --> 05:20:04,596
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that proposal addresses one of the core conflicts at hand, which is one, a lot of the objections seem to be elected officials setting the pay of other elected officials when we've recently had these conversations.

2998
05:20:05,536 --> 05:20:08,919
[SPEAKER_06]: And two, that the council just didn't do its job.

2999
05:20:09,659 --> 05:20:13,282
[SPEAKER_06]: For 25 years, there was no adjustment to the school committee pay.

3000
05:20:14,043 --> 05:20:18,586
[SPEAKER_06]: For at least eight years, there was no adjustment to the mayor and city council pay.

3001
05:20:19,897 --> 05:20:27,380
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think a lot of that has to do with the fact of the perception of the council setting rates of pay, especially under current law.

3002
05:20:28,660 --> 05:20:30,000
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why I made this proposal.

3003
05:20:30,020 --> 05:20:32,801
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm open to thoughts amendments changes.

3004
05:20:33,802 --> 05:20:40,764
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, my hope is that if none of these amendments that I proposed are adopted regarding compensation.

3005
05:20:42,073 --> 05:21:05,384
[SPEAKER_06]: we really just try to flush out a little bit more of the question of ensuring that if it does end up being incumbent on the council to make these choices, that there's some mechanism beyond just an outside committee making a recommendation so that we don't end up in a situation where the school committee goes for 24 years with no, no just adjustment or even review of their, their compensation.

3006
05:21:05,905 --> 05:21:06,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

3007
05:21:07,966 --> 05:21:08,726
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Scarpelli.

3008
05:21:09,827 --> 05:21:10,147
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

3009
05:21:12,465 --> 05:21:17,147
[SPEAKER_20]: First of all, I think that looking at 20% to 25% of $160,000, that would increase the city council pay to, what, $40,000, $45,000 a year?

3010
05:21:17,167 --> 05:21:17,208
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

3011
05:21:17,228 --> 05:21:18,408
[SPEAKER_20]: Council would be basically regret right now.

3012
05:21:43,179 --> 05:21:57,484
[SPEAKER_20]: I would not support this for the fact that I think that the council, I would rather see that the council make the motion of increasing a COLA raise after

3013
05:21:58,225 --> 05:22:15,415
[SPEAKER_20]: all city bargaining units are compensated before they move forward to ask for, that we would ask for a raise, and then it would be implemented into the next election cycle.

3014
05:22:15,955 --> 05:22:25,601
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think that, again, we're seeing a lot of good, bad faith in the last couple of years here, where we've seen union members

3015
05:22:26,222 --> 05:22:42,278
[SPEAKER_20]: not getting paid I think the police now we're up to the rank and file I believe they're close to 900 days over 900 days, then the administration's over 1100 days or something so I mean you're looking at compensation and what we're looking for here is

3016
05:22:43,011 --> 05:22:47,075
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it's something to put this in effect.

3017
05:22:48,156 --> 05:23:06,352
[SPEAKER_20]: I think there could be language that could be added with this and that the compensation would read that the council would vote for the upcoming an increase of COLA increase after their bodies have been compensated or their

3018
05:23:07,508 --> 05:23:08,849
[SPEAKER_20]: their contracts have been ratified.

3019
05:23:08,929 --> 05:23:11,912
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think that I would be more amended to something like that.

3020
05:23:11,972 --> 05:23:26,106
[SPEAKER_20]: I just don't, um, and I don't think that when we're not seeing, we're not seeing most bodies, uh, union employees here from the city getting regular cold payments, every increases every year.

3021
05:23:26,686 --> 05:23:30,710
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that this council shouldn't, shouldn't even entertain that right now.

3022
05:23:30,750 --> 05:23:31,831
[SPEAKER_20]: Like I said, and I think that

3023
05:23:32,693 --> 05:23:45,658
[SPEAKER_20]: To be honest with you, I think that as we move forward, my motion would be to decrease our salaries for the fact that if we, when we go to ward representation, our jobs would drastically be different.

3024
05:23:45,758 --> 05:23:51,160
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think that looking at your ward representation, it's a smaller area.

3025
05:23:51,740 --> 05:23:59,243
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I personally, especially in the last couple of months, I've reached out and talked to maybe hundreds of people

3026
05:24:00,201 --> 05:24:01,202
[SPEAKER_20]: from all over the city.

3027
05:24:01,262 --> 05:24:06,724
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think that the compensation piece I think should reflect what we're doing.

3028
05:24:07,245 --> 05:24:18,510
[SPEAKER_20]: If our job title is now decreased for the amount of residents we're reaching out to, I think that our pay should reflect that.

3029
05:24:18,530 --> 05:24:24,133
[SPEAKER_20]: So my recommendation would be a form of motion that we would cut our pay at least a third to

3030
05:24:25,508 --> 05:24:36,398
[SPEAKER_20]: to reflect the job duties that would be changed in the, hopefully, in the, with the ward representation.

3031
05:24:36,458 --> 05:24:42,324
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think that would have to come probably closer to the community as a whole once we vet out

3032
05:24:42,917 --> 05:24:46,318
[SPEAKER_20]: the process, so I think that I just want that to be known.

3033
05:24:46,798 --> 05:24:50,919
[SPEAKER_20]: I won't make it as a motion tonight, but we can add it in the night of the Committee of the Whole.

3034
05:24:50,979 --> 05:25:08,424
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll make that a motion with the proper language to make sure that both the members, the union members in this community, and the residents realize that this council gets paid for the work they perform, and that's it.

3035
05:25:08,744 --> 05:25:09,244
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you.

3036
05:25:12,779 --> 05:25:13,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

3037
05:25:14,320 --> 05:25:17,261
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, here I'll go bad news, good news.

3038
05:25:18,302 --> 05:25:24,905
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't believe that we should pay different counselors differently based on the seats that they have.

3039
05:25:26,506 --> 05:25:35,270
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think that moving to more local district word representation really will mean that any one of us will be doing a different job than we're doing now.

3040
05:25:36,357 --> 05:25:47,160
[SPEAKER_06]: But on the flip side, I appreciate Councilor Scarpelli's thought, and it actually inspired, I think, a thought for me that it might be, and you know, depends on who's in the office, right?

3041
05:25:48,261 --> 05:26:00,084
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think there's a little bit of an incentive here that maybe we could put in to Councilor Scarpelli's point that the increases only go into effect at a time when all collective bargaining agreements are settled.

3042
05:26:02,007 --> 05:26:21,454
[SPEAKER_06]: And that might be a way I would be supportive of that amendment because I think that's actually an interesting way to, you know, obviously I support some pretty much more significant empowerment of our public employee unions than maybe all of us do here, as I've mentioned the right to strike before here.

3043
05:26:23,186 --> 05:26:27,688
[SPEAKER_06]: this is a way, I think, to go towards your point.

3044
05:26:28,188 --> 05:26:31,209
[SPEAKER_06]: And my only thing would be that it should just go back to the same starting point.

3045
05:26:31,849 --> 05:26:45,035
[SPEAKER_06]: So if someone can't, if the executive hasn't settled all of the agreements, then we have to wait to a point when that happens, and then everybody gets their changes at that time.

3046
05:26:45,815 --> 05:26:47,656
[SPEAKER_06]: But that'd be something I'm totally interested in.

3047
05:26:47,676 --> 05:26:48,696
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a creative idea.

3048
05:26:50,589 --> 05:26:54,516
[SPEAKER_06]: An interesting thought from Councilor Scarpelli that gave me an interesting thought.

3049
05:26:54,616 --> 05:26:56,078
[SPEAKER_06]: So that would be an amendment I would support.

3050
05:26:59,704 --> 05:27:01,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have any other comments from Councilors?

3051
05:27:02,028 --> 05:27:03,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor, Vice President Collins.

3052
05:27:06,722 --> 05:27:07,643
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Chair Tsang.

3053
05:27:09,265 --> 05:27:11,387
[SPEAKER_31]: I appreciate these proposals put forward.

3054
05:27:11,947 --> 05:27:15,992
[SPEAKER_31]: I am generally supportive of the proposal put forward by President Behrs.

3055
05:27:17,053 --> 05:27:25,341
[SPEAKER_31]: We have talked not a lot, but more than usual, about compensation for elected officials over the past, I'd say, term and a half than I think we usually do.

3056
05:27:26,282 --> 05:27:29,745
[SPEAKER_31]: I think that this is something that electeds do not like talking about.

3057
05:27:29,785 --> 05:27:32,226
[SPEAKER_31]: I think this is something that the public does not like us talking about.

3058
05:27:32,246 --> 05:27:37,991
[SPEAKER_31]: I think that we have more important work to do than talk about how elected officials should be compensated.

3059
05:27:38,011 --> 05:27:47,398
[SPEAKER_31]: I think it goes without saying that a lot of electeds find it distasteful to have to talk about how much people in our roles are to be compensated.

3060
05:27:48,698 --> 05:27:50,999
[SPEAKER_31]: I know that many members of the public find it distasteful.

3061
05:27:51,580 --> 05:27:58,323
[SPEAKER_31]: If this is not done consistently by ordinance or by charter, then it is something that we have to talk about.

3062
05:27:59,003 --> 05:28:10,748
[SPEAKER_31]: For myself as one counselor, I would feel much more comfortable if this was dictated by charter, not up to me or anybody else to vote on the compensation of myself or any other elected official while we're in office.

3063
05:28:12,029 --> 05:28:14,770
[SPEAKER_31]: I think that this would be a huge asset and that it would take it

3064
05:28:15,470 --> 05:28:19,454
[SPEAKER_31]: out of our hands, it would not affect elected officials while they are currently in their current term.

3065
05:28:20,394 --> 05:28:22,957
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think that this sets a new fair standard.

3066
05:28:23,457 --> 05:28:31,084
[SPEAKER_31]: And most importantly, it regularizes it, it takes us out of something that sitting electeds have to vote on that would affect other sitting electeds.

3067
05:28:31,904 --> 05:28:50,709
[SPEAKER_31]: and I would also be supportive of the, if it were to go forward, I would be supportive of the proposed amendment or, you know, amendment to the proposal put forward by President Behrs, inspired by Councilor Scarpelli's comments about, you know, how we are, we're always conscious of other outstanding compensation contracts in the city at the same time.

3068
05:28:51,709 --> 05:28:51,989
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

3069
05:28:53,429 --> 05:28:54,529
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

3070
05:28:54,589 --> 05:28:56,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have any other comments from Councilors?

3071
05:28:59,055 --> 05:29:01,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, going to public participation.

3072
05:29:01,937 --> 05:29:03,037
[SPEAKER_28]: Damon, just for the record, please.

3073
05:29:03,638 --> 05:29:06,179
[SPEAKER_28]: Steven South, 106 Damon Road.

3074
05:29:06,920 --> 05:29:08,320
[SPEAKER_28]: Just a couple comments.

3075
05:29:08,901 --> 05:29:19,667
[SPEAKER_28]: One, it's been 1,145 days since the inspectors, the DPW superintendents, and the recreation department employees have had a raise.

3076
05:29:20,254 --> 05:29:22,816
[SPEAKER_28]: that's just shy of 38 months.

3077
05:29:23,696 --> 05:29:32,622
[SPEAKER_28]: And the reason that they haven't received a raise is the mayor is demanding monetary concessions from them to sign a new contract.

3078
05:29:33,143 --> 05:29:39,207
[SPEAKER_28]: You also have three public safety contracts that have been expired, I believe about three years.

3079
05:29:39,287 --> 05:29:48,273
[SPEAKER_28]: And I don't speak for them, but it's the police patrolman, the police superiors and the dispatch contracts, the 911 dispatchers.

3080
05:29:49,252 --> 05:29:55,298
[SPEAKER_28]: I also want to bring up when Kit Collins just said this would be a new fair standard.

3081
05:29:55,898 --> 05:29:57,439
[SPEAKER_28]: I just want to bring up a couple of things.

3082
05:29:57,520 --> 05:29:59,842
[SPEAKER_28]: Last year, the mayor received three raises.

3083
05:30:00,302 --> 05:30:05,367
[SPEAKER_28]: Those were two raises for her being mayor and one for her being head of the school committee.

3084
05:30:06,127 --> 05:30:07,829
[SPEAKER_28]: City council got two raises.

3085
05:30:08,730 --> 05:30:13,214
[SPEAKER_28]: And the school committee, as we're talking about, you know,

3086
05:30:15,570 --> 05:30:22,795
[SPEAKER_28]: President Baird's talked about bringing everybody up to either 20%, which would be 32,000 or 25%, which would be 40,000 of the mayor's new proposed salary.

3087
05:30:22,815 --> 05:30:25,037
[SPEAKER_28]: The school committee last year went from 12,000 to 17,000.

3088
05:30:25,077 --> 05:30:27,939
[SPEAKER_28]: This July 1st, they're scheduled to go from 17,000 to 22,000.

3089
05:30:27,999 --> 05:30:29,540
[SPEAKER_28]: That's in a one year time, they will have went up 83.33%.

3090
05:30:44,082 --> 05:31:00,772
[SPEAKER_28]: So to bring them then from 22,000 to either 32 or 40,000 is just astronomical raises when the city of Medford, we've averaged a little over 2% over the last 20 years, the rank and file members.

3091
05:31:02,032 --> 05:31:05,455
[SPEAKER_28]: So I just want to bring all those things up and all this is on the heels.

3092
05:31:05,835 --> 05:31:21,105
[SPEAKER_28]: And when Kit Collins talked about this not being popular well it's certainly not popular, just three months after a $7.5 million override, where all of our taxes got, you know, increased significantly.

3093
05:31:22,488 --> 05:31:40,279
[SPEAKER_28]: And, and remember you guys brought up raises only one week after the override vote exactly one week later, it was the first item that that you talked about so I just I hope you take all these things into consideration, and I do love the idea of no raises until.

3094
05:31:41,318 --> 05:31:43,739
[SPEAKER_28]: all of the collective bargaining agreements are settled.

3095
05:31:44,519 --> 05:31:52,440
[SPEAKER_28]: And, you know, obviously we think that, you know, I think collectively everybody thinks that everyone should get a raise every year.

3096
05:31:52,760 --> 05:31:56,841
[SPEAKER_28]: That includes the council, the school committee, and the mayor.

3097
05:31:56,901 --> 05:32:05,683
[SPEAKER_28]: I think everybody should get a raise, but certainly you guys shouldn't get raises year after year, multiple raises year after year.

3098
05:32:06,343 --> 05:32:11,325
[SPEAKER_28]: while employees within the city that work full time for the city go one.

3099
05:32:18,307 --> 05:32:18,807
[SPEAKER_06]: President Burris.

3100
05:32:19,427 --> 05:32:20,327
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to note.

3101
05:32:24,189 --> 05:32:25,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Just wanted to note that.

3102
05:32:27,870 --> 05:32:32,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, one of the reasons that we had the conversation that we had was because no change have been made for 25 years.

3103
05:32:33,071 --> 05:32:34,232
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, again,

3104
05:32:35,555 --> 05:32:39,358
[SPEAKER_06]: No one would stand for that, having no changes for 25 years.

3105
05:32:41,099 --> 05:32:49,566
[SPEAKER_06]: But I also want to make a point that Councillor Callaghan brought up a measure that everyone else on this council strongly disagreed with one week after the election.

3106
05:32:49,646 --> 05:32:53,308
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just don't think it's a fair characterization to say that we brought up this thing.

3107
05:32:53,649 --> 05:32:54,549
[SPEAKER_06]: She brought up something.

3108
05:32:55,010 --> 05:32:56,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Her idea was, of course, actually to

3109
05:32:58,289 --> 05:33:02,495
[SPEAKER_06]: make changing elected official pay harder, but that got lost, I think, in a very complicated conversation.

3110
05:33:02,815 --> 05:33:12,568
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm pretty sure all of us are on record at that meeting being pretty clear that we didn't support the initiative and having the conversation or the timing of it.

3111
05:33:12,829 --> 05:33:13,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

3112
05:33:13,550 --> 05:33:14,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Chairman Gold.

3113
05:33:15,849 --> 05:33:17,930
[SPEAKER_00]: Milford McDonald, 61 Monument Street.

3114
05:33:18,930 --> 05:33:29,053
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to say that the language that the committee put into the charter regarding compensation is standard language that's in charters across the state.

3115
05:33:30,434 --> 05:33:35,836
[SPEAKER_00]: The compensation committee that Councilor Behrs mentioned is not in the charter.

3116
05:33:35,856 --> 05:33:38,717
[SPEAKER_00]: That was something that we recommended that you consider

3117
05:33:39,517 --> 05:33:46,821
[SPEAKER_00]: creating in an ordinance to address some of the issues that have been talked about in the last several minutes.

3118
05:33:47,982 --> 05:33:55,006
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to say that we looked at many charters and we didn't see anything remotely like this in any charter and

3119
05:33:56,807 --> 05:34:11,842
[SPEAKER_00]: And that because of that, the Collins Center might be, it might be a good idea to ask them their thoughts on it because we know that something that's really unusual in the charter could raise a flag at the State House.

3120
05:34:12,123 --> 05:34:12,883
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I have to say.

3121
05:34:13,624 --> 05:34:14,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

3122
05:34:14,865 --> 05:34:18,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have any comments online on compensation?

3123
05:34:20,991 --> 05:34:25,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, I'm calling it into public participation.

3124
05:34:26,316 --> 05:34:27,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Councillor Scarpelli.

3125
05:34:27,297 --> 05:34:27,577
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

3126
05:34:27,617 --> 05:34:30,660
[SPEAKER_20]: Just to that, I think that's a great idea.

3127
05:34:30,680 --> 05:34:35,665
[SPEAKER_20]: If we can, before the Committee of the Whole, maybe if I can

3128
05:34:37,564 --> 05:34:49,093
[SPEAKER_20]: request something to that point of what the wording would look like or if that's ever been done before when that type of a standard and chatter.

3129
05:34:50,334 --> 05:34:50,655
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

3130
05:34:52,536 --> 05:34:53,317
[SPEAKER_20]: And I apologize.

3131
05:34:53,377 --> 05:34:54,758
[SPEAKER_20]: I know it's like being in a hockey rink.

3132
05:34:54,798 --> 05:35:00,483
[SPEAKER_20]: So I know you probably think you're at one of your children's hockey games about 44 degrees in here.

3133
05:35:00,503 --> 05:35:03,085
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry about that.

3134
05:35:06,307 --> 05:35:06,908
[SPEAKER_09]: President Behrs.

3135
05:35:07,880 --> 05:35:18,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I just, can I ask you guys the question now about different forms of compensation structures that you see?

3136
05:35:19,349 --> 05:35:30,697
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that, not that we really are looking to replicate any of the existing charter, but that the initial charter that we're under now did set the rate of pay for the mayor.

3137
05:35:32,759 --> 05:35:35,681
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, and there were also subsequent special acts.

3138
05:35:36,258 --> 05:35:44,141
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah, leading up to the special act we have now, which is what we vote, you know, if certain people get a raise, we get a raise too, basically.

3139
05:35:45,781 --> 05:36:05,448
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, the standard is in chapter 43 of the general laws, which is the text that's in the charter now that we provided to the committee, which is that you determine a raise within the first 18 months, and you're not giving yourself a raise.

3140
05:36:06,537 --> 05:36:10,398
[SPEAKER_15]: We were giving the new, the next sitting council gets the race.

3141
05:36:10,658 --> 05:36:12,919
[SPEAKER_15]: And yes, some of you will run for re-election.

3142
05:36:13,099 --> 05:36:14,880
[SPEAKER_15]: And yes, some of you will be re-elected.

3143
05:36:15,500 --> 05:36:19,802
[SPEAKER_15]: But you are not voting for your race at that time.

3144
05:36:21,342 --> 05:36:23,923
[SPEAKER_15]: It goes, it takes effect when.

3145
05:36:23,943 --> 05:36:34,087
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you add Councilor Ker-Pelly's amendment, it takes effect

3146
05:36:35,018 --> 05:36:41,382
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, when the new council takes office and if you add the union requirements.

3147
05:36:41,542 --> 05:36:54,949
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess, so this, would setting an amount in the charter be a flag for the legislature, considering that it exists at least in our charter and I would guess in other charters?

3148
05:36:55,830 --> 05:36:56,610
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it doesn't.

3149
05:36:56,910 --> 05:36:57,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

3150
05:36:57,871 --> 05:36:58,471
[SPEAKER_06]: We were unique.

3151
05:36:58,831 --> 05:36:59,091
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

3152
05:36:59,652 --> 05:37:00,852
[SPEAKER_06]: We were the only charter that had that.

3153
05:37:00,953 --> 05:37:02,954
[SPEAKER_15]: And no one has automatic raises in their charter.

3154
05:37:03,234 --> 05:37:03,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

3155
05:37:04,305 --> 05:37:07,487
[SPEAKER_15]: and you're appropriating the money anyway.

3156
05:37:08,788 --> 05:37:10,629
[SPEAKER_15]: Money is appropriated for the raise.

3157
05:37:10,889 --> 05:37:17,173
[SPEAKER_15]: And so someone who wants to do a little bit knows that you gave yourself a raise.

3158
05:37:18,714 --> 05:37:22,957
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the concern, but no one has automatic raises that I know of.

3159
05:37:23,417 --> 05:37:23,757
Okay.

3160
05:37:25,958 --> 05:37:26,859
[SPEAKER_06]: I withdraw my amendments.

3161
05:37:26,879 --> 05:37:27,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

3162
05:37:28,740 --> 05:37:29,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

3163
05:37:30,321 --> 05:37:30,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

3164
05:37:32,683 --> 05:37:33,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Zara.

3165
05:37:34,650 --> 05:37:40,396
[SPEAKER_26]: I appreciate the spirit with which the amendments were proposed.

3166
05:37:40,436 --> 05:37:43,139
[SPEAKER_26]: I think it would have been really nice if we didn't have to have this conversation.

3167
05:37:43,540 --> 05:37:51,569
[SPEAKER_26]: But I also think that it's kind of inherent in the way that we do politics that that we have these conversations and that's part of

3168
05:37:52,338 --> 05:38:08,413
[SPEAKER_26]: what our voters will talk about and what they have to weigh when we openly and honestly discuss issues of compensation, our elected officials in Washington vote for their own raises too.

3169
05:38:08,893 --> 05:38:09,514
[SPEAKER_26]: And we know that.

3170
05:38:10,515 --> 05:38:15,640
[SPEAKER_26]: And when they do that, we factor that in to whether or not we

3171
05:38:16,618 --> 05:38:19,720
[SPEAKER_26]: reelect them or elect somebody else who says maybe they won't do that.

3172
05:38:20,220 --> 05:38:26,264
[SPEAKER_26]: And it's one of many things that we weigh, factors that we weigh out, and people should be doing that for us too.

3173
05:38:27,304 --> 05:38:36,630
[SPEAKER_26]: You can look at the things that we've decided to do and say, you know, that was a bridge too far, and I'm not going to vote for that person again, and that's your right as a voter.

3174
05:38:37,290 --> 05:38:41,174
[SPEAKER_26]: And, you know, I kind of think that that's fair and reasonable.

3175
05:38:42,255 --> 05:38:59,192
[SPEAKER_26]: If we speak honestly about what we think that people in this position deserve to be paid and people on the school committee deserve to be paid and what the mayor deserves to be paid, and we stand by it, then great, you know, we're doing what we think we should be doing, and the voters should know about it.

3176
05:39:01,314 --> 05:39:01,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

3177
05:39:01,694 --> 05:39:06,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have any final motions or comments before we end?

3178
05:39:06,776 --> 05:39:06,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

3179
05:39:07,977 --> 05:39:24,383
[SPEAKER_20]: It's been a long time, but to our team, I think that in the Collins team, I think that I appreciate, you know, sitting through and bearing with the weather and everything you've done.

3180
05:39:24,423 --> 05:39:29,645
[SPEAKER_20]: I know that going through this process and seeing what, especially what you've done, Mr. McDonald,

3181
05:39:30,490 --> 05:39:35,074
[SPEAKER_20]: so many people tried to do before and the efforts you put into it.

3182
05:39:35,174 --> 05:39:45,923
[SPEAKER_20]: I know that one thing I do talk about a lot is transparency and communication and making sure that everybody knows what's going on.

3183
05:39:46,003 --> 05:39:58,033
[SPEAKER_20]: And even as stuck as I was in my way, I think I had five to 10 phone calls from the child review committee just to get my viewpoint so they can understand it.

3184
05:39:58,695 --> 05:39:59,796
[SPEAKER_20]: and then weigh it differently.

3185
05:39:59,836 --> 05:40:04,320
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that says a lot about what you're doing.

3186
05:40:04,941 --> 05:40:09,625
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that this community needs a lot more of a McDonald's.

3187
05:40:09,765 --> 05:40:11,047
[SPEAKER_20]: So I appreciate your hard work.

3188
05:40:11,667 --> 05:40:11,987
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

3189
05:40:12,748 --> 05:40:17,352
[SPEAKER_20]: And thanks.

3190
05:40:17,873 --> 05:40:20,956
[SPEAKER_20]: Just to think you'll be moving on to another community soon.

3191
05:40:21,476 --> 05:40:22,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like this.

3192
05:40:23,880 --> 05:40:27,437
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure it'll be a slightly easier job.

3193
05:40:30,026 --> 05:40:31,887
[SPEAKER_06]: I would just like to make a final motion.

3194
05:40:32,807 --> 05:40:35,388
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is just, we've made a bunch of amendments.

3195
05:40:36,228 --> 05:40:37,769
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to get this due diligence right.

3196
05:40:38,429 --> 05:40:53,734
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the only people that really hurts are you and me, because I think you guys were planning to do this anyway, but I'd make a motion to request that the chair saying the vice chair and the call center take the committee reports and the motions as drafted.

3197
05:40:54,074 --> 05:40:56,135
[SPEAKER_06]: And we each create our own red line versions.

3198
05:40:57,255 --> 05:41:02,582
[SPEAKER_06]: from the existing charter, just to make sure that we all catch all the different changes that we've made.

3199
05:41:02,602 --> 05:41:07,207
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the three I's are better than one of the six or however many you guys have.

3200
05:41:07,407 --> 05:41:07,988
[SPEAKER_06]: I only have two.

3201
05:41:09,850 --> 05:41:11,752
[SPEAKER_06]: So just be emotion and that we get those.

3202
05:41:13,334 --> 05:41:18,598
[SPEAKER_06]: by February 27th so that we can include those in the Committee of the Whole packet for March 4th.

3203
05:41:19,919 --> 05:41:23,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we add to that transferring the papers to the Committee of the Whole and adjourning?

3204
05:41:23,862 --> 05:41:28,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we could add on to that that we refer this to Committee of the Whole and adjourn.

3205
05:41:29,086 --> 05:41:31,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Matthew, I see you have a comment.

3206
05:41:31,067 --> 05:41:32,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you keep it to one minute?

3207
05:41:33,369 --> 05:41:33,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

3208
05:41:33,749 --> 05:41:34,370
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

3209
05:41:35,995 --> 05:41:37,436
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just roping back to something.

3210
05:41:37,456 --> 05:41:44,521
[SPEAKER_02]: I was told that there's an answer in a section in a particular text that I was referring to in their answers.

3211
05:41:44,541 --> 05:41:47,122
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about 97C.

3212
05:41:47,162 --> 05:41:58,810
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as standardizing how the meeting minutes get put on, this chart is creating a bystander effect because it does not specify that the secretary of commissions will get those minutes transferred.

3213
05:41:59,170 --> 05:42:00,331
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really kind of hope

3214
05:42:00,771 --> 05:42:07,457
[SPEAKER_02]: that that can be discussed in the committee or whatever, because as it is right now, it's saying it will be done, but it doesn't say who will get it done.

3215
05:42:07,497 --> 05:42:10,159
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know a lot of times if nobody's assigned to it, it won't get done.

3216
05:42:10,439 --> 05:42:10,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

3217
05:42:12,141 --> 05:42:13,221
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a fair point.

3218
05:42:13,462 --> 05:42:17,005
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll be able to revisit that in the Committee of the Whole.

3219
05:42:17,565 --> 05:42:19,246
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you all for joining us tonight.

3220
05:42:19,266 --> 05:42:24,130
[SPEAKER_09]: I know a lot of you've spent a very, very long time with us.

3221
05:42:24,150 --> 05:42:27,033
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been a marathon meeting, five and a half hours.

3222
05:42:27,793 --> 05:42:32,776
[SPEAKER_09]: But I am grateful for all of your work, a lot of hard discussions, but good discussions, very thorough discussions.

3223
05:42:33,217 --> 05:42:49,226
[SPEAKER_09]: So on President Behrs' motion, seconded by Councilor Zaro to have the Chair and Vice Chair of this committee and the Collins Center create separate red line versions by February 27th to refer this to the committee as a whole and to adjourn this meeting.

3224
05:42:49,426 --> 05:42:50,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready.

3225
05:42:53,849 --> 05:42:54,849
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Collins.

3226
05:42:55,510 --> 05:42:55,690
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

3227
05:42:57,848 --> 05:43:05,717
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Zaro, Councilor Scarpelli, President Piers, Chairman Singh.

3228
05:43:05,837 --> 05:43:06,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

3229
05:43:08,059 --> 05:43:08,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Five in favour.

3230
05:43:08,900 --> 05:43:09,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Five in favour.

3231
05:43:09,841 --> 05:43:10,862
[SPEAKER_09]: None opposed.
