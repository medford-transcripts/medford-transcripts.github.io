1
00:03:59,335 --> 00:03:59,396
you

2

[SPEAKER_17]: Meeting of the Medford School Committee will now come to order.

[SPEAKER_17]: All please rise and salute our flag.

27
00:05:38,766 --> 00:05:50,148
[SPEAKER_17]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

28
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,520
[SPEAKER_17]: Approval of the minutes of September 12, 2016.

29
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,020

43
00:06:14,235 --> 00:06:14,295

[SPEAKER_17]: Approval is granted.

53

[SPEAKER_17]: Report of the secretary.

54
00:06:29,588 --> 00:06:31,188
[SPEAKER_17]: None?

55
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:33,169
[SPEAKER_17]: Report of committees.

56
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:34,790
[SPEAKER_17]: Committee of the Whole Minutes, September 12, 2016.

57
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:42,033
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a motion for approval of the Committee of the Whole Minutes from September 12.

58
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:44,114
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a second?

59
00:06:46,635 --> 00:06:47,335
[SPEAKER_17]: Seconded by Ms.

60
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:47,735
[SPEAKER_16]: Koretz.

61
00:06:48,676 --> 00:06:49,356
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Benedetto.

62
00:06:50,545 --> 00:06:53,906
[SPEAKER_16]: So at that time, we visited the McGlynn School.

63
00:06:53,986 --> 00:06:57,786
[SPEAKER_16]: And I was wondering if we had any dates set to visit any of the other schools.

64
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,987
[SPEAKER_17]: We will be setting some dates next week.

65
00:07:01,027 --> 00:07:03,387
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll be in touch with each of you to try and coordinate an evening.

66
00:07:03,707 --> 00:07:03,967
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

67
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:04,547
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

68
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:05,207
[SPEAKER_17]: You're welcome.

69
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,428
[SPEAKER_17]: Community participation.

70
00:07:09,488 --> 00:07:11,068
[SPEAKER_17]: Cheryl Rodriguez, Roberts School.

71
00:07:15,549 --> 00:07:16,329
[SPEAKER_00]: Name and address, please.

72
00:07:16,829 --> 00:07:17,009
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.

73
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:18,210
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

74
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,090
[SPEAKER_00]: My address is 281 Park Street.

75
00:07:22,118 --> 00:07:27,242
[SPEAKER_00]: I prepared a statement because I want to make sure that I get everything I want to say.

76
00:07:27,802 --> 00:07:30,844
[SPEAKER_00]: So my daughter is a third grade student at the Roberts Elementary.

77
00:07:31,024 --> 00:07:32,785
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an active parent at that school.

78
00:07:33,346 --> 00:07:36,988
[SPEAKER_00]: I appeared before this body in the spring to request funds for our mosaic mural.

79
00:07:37,648 --> 00:07:42,632
[SPEAKER_00]: I helped run some of the enrichment nights at the school and the after school enrichment program for the PTO.

80
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:44,973
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very invested in the school.

81
00:07:45,974 --> 00:07:50,237
[SPEAKER_00]: At the last school committee meeting, there were questions about the classes at the Roberts.

82
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:58,605
[SPEAKER_00]: And a comment was made that Mr. Johnson distributed his special needs students differently than other schools and no one knew why.

83
00:07:59,886 --> 00:08:04,089
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to explain a little bit and ask for some help from this group.

84
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:08,533
[SPEAKER_00]: The Roberts Elementary has the highest enrollment of all the elementary schools in our city.

85
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:15,518
[SPEAKER_00]: It also houses the welcome program for the English language learners, meaning those with no English skills, and our autism program.

86
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:23,485
[SPEAKER_00]: These are two very large programs, 92 and 75, respectively, as of September 16th, but these numbers are constantly changing.

87
00:08:24,365 --> 00:08:27,127
[SPEAKER_00]: To put that into perspective, it is divided equally by grade.

88
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:30,029
[SPEAKER_00]: We would have 15.3 ELL students per grade and 12.5 autistic children per grade.

89
00:08:30,049 --> 00:08:30,909
[SPEAKER_00]: So 17% ELL and 14% autistic.

90
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,990
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have 51% low income.

91
00:08:40,275 --> 00:08:49,603
[SPEAKER_00]: On September 9th, our total population was reported at 547, but as of September 16th, it had already climbed to 555 and is perhaps even higher now.

92
00:08:50,844 --> 00:08:52,705
[SPEAKER_00]: Conversely, the Brooks Elementary has 449.

93
00:08:54,847 --> 00:09:03,514
[SPEAKER_00]: It was noted at the last meeting that the two middle schools, the one that housed the ELL population was deliberately kept smaller as new students enter the program constantly.

94
00:09:04,114 --> 00:09:08,618
[SPEAKER_00]: The same is true at the Roberts, but we do not have the buffer of being the smallest elementary school or the largest.

95
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:17,940
[SPEAKER_00]: Our ELL students are taken out of class to receive specialized services to help them to learn English, so they are grouped in the same class in order to accommodate scheduling.

96
00:09:18,621 --> 00:09:24,709
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine trying to keep five third grade classes on identical schedules to pull ELL students out of each one.

97
00:09:26,743 --> 00:09:31,005
[SPEAKER_00]: Our higher needs autism students are also placed together because some of them share an aid.

98
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:36,748
[SPEAKER_00]: It was made pretty clear at budget time that there's no appetite on this committee to have an aid in each class.

99
00:09:37,388 --> 00:09:39,729
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that this process needs a deeper look.

100
00:09:41,128 --> 00:09:44,071
[SPEAKER_00]: My daughter has found herself in the autism inclusion class this year.

101
00:09:44,972 --> 00:09:49,177
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that there are some in the other classes, but there are higher needs students in her class.

102
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:59,669
[SPEAKER_00]: The children at the Roberts are the most empathetic children that you will ever meet, but the things my daughter has been exposed to since school started at this class has given me pause.

103
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Something must be done for these children.

104
00:10:02,795 --> 00:10:11,821
[SPEAKER_00]: The teacher and aide in this class have been hit, furniture has been thrown, the classroom has been evacuated, and children have been physically restrained on almost a daily basis.

105
00:10:12,742 --> 00:10:13,983
[SPEAKER_00]: Who is benefiting from this?

106
00:10:14,603 --> 00:10:22,129
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the special needs children forced into a mainstream setting that is clearly overwhelming, not the quote standard students who are witnessing these events.

107
00:10:22,749 --> 00:10:28,073
[SPEAKER_00]: None of them are receiving an appropriate education as all learning must cease when one of these episodes begin.

108
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:34,511
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I tried to discuss the wild stories that my child was coming home with, I hit a wall of privacy issues.

109
00:10:35,131 --> 00:10:42,432
[SPEAKER_00]: If my child, any child, is being exposed to incidences that are traumatic and are violent in nature, the parents need to be notified.

110
00:10:43,313 --> 00:10:48,514
[SPEAKER_00]: Parents should not hear these stories from their children and hear nothing from the school.

111
00:10:49,394 --> 00:10:51,734
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to help our children to process what is happening.

112
00:10:52,014 --> 00:10:53,714
[SPEAKER_00]: We are empathetic to all of the children.

113
00:10:54,215 --> 00:10:56,155
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the children in this situation needs help.

114
00:10:57,558 --> 00:10:59,120
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this unique to my child's class?

115
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,321
[SPEAKER_00]: I think no.

116
00:11:00,441 --> 00:11:02,843
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this an appropriate setting for any of these children?

117
00:11:03,544 --> 00:11:04,305
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely no.

118
00:11:05,486 --> 00:11:10,731
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time that we stop acting as if the population of the Roberts is the same as at the other schools.

119
00:11:11,372 --> 00:11:16,016
[SPEAKER_00]: Our school houses two high needs groups and the largest child population in the city.

120
00:11:16,617 --> 00:11:19,960
[SPEAKER_00]: One of these programs should be shifted to a school with a lower population.

121
00:11:20,508 --> 00:11:29,393
[SPEAKER_00]: If our class sizes were closer to the 15 to 16 mark that some of the elementary schools have, we would be able to have smaller classes for our autistic population.

122
00:11:29,894 --> 00:11:35,657
[SPEAKER_00]: We could easily bring their class size down to 8 to 10 with no negative impact on any other classes.

123
00:11:36,317 --> 00:11:40,220
[SPEAKER_00]: But as it stands, in order to try and bring a second grade class total

124
00:11:41,095 --> 00:11:48,498
[SPEAKER_00]: Down from the 22 average for the autism emerging class, we were forced to have one class have a total of 24 students.

125
00:11:49,138 --> 00:11:52,739
[SPEAKER_00]: As a comparison, the second grade class at the Brooks has an average of 17.25.

126
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:59,841
[SPEAKER_00]: My daughter is in grade three, which has five classrooms and an average class size of 19.8.

127
00:12:02,482 --> 00:12:06,224
[SPEAKER_00]: Across town, the Brooks has four third grade classes with an average class size of 17.5.

128
00:12:09,102 --> 00:12:17,909
[SPEAKER_00]: This population difference will only intensify when some of the 800 plus units permanent or under construction for the Robertson McGlynn Elementary School begin to hold residents.

129
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,152
[SPEAKER_00]: The needs of all the children need to be considered.

130
00:12:21,292 --> 00:12:22,513
[SPEAKER_00]: I care about all of them.

131
00:12:23,214 --> 00:12:23,914
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with them.

132
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:30,600
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm floored by the natural and easy way that they take care of each other and I'm asking the school department to step in and help them.

133
00:12:31,754 --> 00:12:38,617
[SPEAKER_00]: My own daughter is suffering greatly as a result of her exposure in these classes, and I'm still finding out what she's witnessed in small pieces.

134
00:12:39,177 --> 00:12:49,261
[SPEAKER_00]: She's confided in my parents, in the parents of some of her friends, and some in my husband and I. The first thing she told me was that she was worried for the children that were having the incidents.

135
00:12:49,781 --> 00:12:51,782
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing she told me was that she was afraid.

136
00:12:52,562 --> 00:12:54,283
[SPEAKER_00]: No child should be afraid to go to school.

137
00:12:56,428 --> 00:13:01,171
[SPEAKER_00]: Upon hearing that, I started a crusade to help my child and the other children in her class or classes like hers.

138
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,692
[SPEAKER_00]: I spoke to the teacher who directed me to the principal.

139
00:13:04,112 --> 00:13:14,618
[SPEAKER_00]: I spoke to the principal, and other than the incident that required a student to leave by ambulance, he had heard of no other incidences, nor had the school department, nor the special needs department.

140
00:13:15,376 --> 00:13:15,616
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?

141
00:13:15,636 --> 00:13:22,868
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect it is because nothing will come of reporting it, but despite my reporting it, nothing has come of it yet.

142
00:13:23,388 --> 00:13:29,117
[SPEAKER_00]: The adjustment Councilor at the school has not even spoken to the children about the incident that was reported and happened a week ago.

143
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,522
[SPEAKER_00]: an incident that required an ambulance to remove a student from the school.

144
00:13:33,862 --> 00:13:35,282
[SPEAKER_00]: The parents have not been notified.

145
00:13:35,963 --> 00:13:36,943
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the protocol?

146
00:13:37,403 --> 00:13:41,685
[SPEAKER_00]: What measures are in place to help these autistic children who are suffering or the other students?

147
00:13:42,525 --> 00:13:45,127
[SPEAKER_00]: My daughter is refusing to go back into that classroom.

148
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:49,128
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been attempting to help her cope with what she has witnessed almost daily.

149
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:51,529
[SPEAKER_00]: She has been having migraine headaches.

150
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:52,990
[SPEAKER_00]: She's extremely anxious.

151
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:57,072
[SPEAKER_00]: This weekend, she had a panic attack, thinking about having to go back to class.

152
00:13:58,306 --> 00:14:07,474
[SPEAKER_00]: She reports that her teachers have assured her that they will keep the children safe and they neither need to worry nor be afraid because they will worry and be afraid for them.

153
00:14:08,454 --> 00:14:11,737
[SPEAKER_00]: My daughter's takeaway from that statement is that the incidents will continue.

154
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:15,620
[SPEAKER_00]: That there will still be danger and that she's just supposed to ignore it.

155
00:14:17,162 --> 00:14:17,962
[SPEAKER_00]: So please help us.

156
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:21,972
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that there's privacy issues, but something has to be done.

157
00:14:22,412 --> 00:14:26,634
[SPEAKER_00]: The teachers in Mr. Johnson are doing the best that they can with the tools available to them.

158
00:14:27,015 --> 00:14:28,135
[SPEAKER_00]: They need more tools.

159
00:14:28,756 --> 00:14:33,619
[SPEAKER_00]: They need a smaller population so they can adjust class sizes to accommodate the high needs of our children.

160
00:14:34,219 --> 00:14:39,062
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't only worry about my one child, but I am worried about my child.

161
00:14:39,382 --> 00:14:41,103
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to worry about all of the children.

162
00:14:41,403 --> 00:14:43,464
[SPEAKER_00]: The needs of all the children are not identical.

163
00:14:46,946 --> 00:14:47,227
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks.

164
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:47,867
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

165
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:50,211
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Superintendent.

166
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:55,375
[SPEAKER_09]: So we met with Mrs. Rodriguez this morning.

167
00:14:56,116 --> 00:14:57,337
[SPEAKER_09]: We went over all these things.

168
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,378
[SPEAKER_09]: We've prepared some materials for you.

169
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:06,164
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to call upon our special needs director and our assistant for elementary education to speak to the issues.

170
00:15:06,685 --> 00:15:07,805
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a lot going on.

171
00:15:08,946 --> 00:15:10,688
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot going on of response.

172
00:15:11,228 --> 00:15:14,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Occasionally in a given classroom, there's going to be some disruption.

173
00:15:15,272 --> 00:15:15,472
[SPEAKER_09]: You know,

174
00:15:16,296 --> 00:15:19,859
[SPEAKER_09]: A year starts, some youngsters express themselves, and then we respond to it.

175
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:29,127
[SPEAKER_09]: When information comes to us, that classroom's been visited multiple times by both Diane and by Kathy, and there's some plans in place.

176
00:15:29,928 --> 00:15:31,409
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't believe it's undoable.

177
00:15:31,969 --> 00:15:35,492
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe the Roberts does have some population issues, but so don't the other schools.

178
00:15:35,532 --> 00:15:38,715
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're at the Columbus, you have the therapeutic learning program.

179
00:15:39,195 --> 00:15:41,277
[SPEAKER_09]: At other schools, you have other programs that are there.

180
00:15:42,598 --> 00:15:44,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Some years, the Brooks has had more people than

181
00:15:45,118 --> 00:15:45,618
[SPEAKER_09]: The Roberts.

182
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,940
[SPEAKER_09]: In some years, the McGlynn has had more people than the Roberts.

183
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Population shifts are by geography to some degree.

184
00:15:51,922 --> 00:16:00,507
[SPEAKER_09]: But having said that, let me ask Diane and Kathy to come up and talk a little bit about the specifics that Mrs. Rodriguez has raised.

185
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:04,449
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to make it very clear, we're very concerned when things happen.

186
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,150
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not unconcerned.

187
00:16:06,671 --> 00:16:08,832
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not a fair assessment of what goes on.

188
00:16:09,592 --> 00:16:10,313
[SPEAKER_09]: But let them speak.

189
00:16:11,933 --> 00:16:12,353
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening.

190
00:16:13,194 --> 00:16:24,863
[SPEAKER_12]: So I prepared a quick report for you to read just to let you know about the incidences that did happen at the Roberts Elementary School in that particular third grade classroom.

191
00:16:25,543 --> 00:16:30,287
[SPEAKER_12]: We do have some children who are special needs children and some ELL students in that classroom.

192
00:16:32,869 --> 00:16:38,033
[SPEAKER_12]: Two students that we are aware of exhibited loud and aggressive behaviors.

193
00:16:38,511 --> 00:16:42,412
[SPEAKER_12]: that required interventions through the safety care support team.

194
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:51,115
[SPEAKER_12]: Neither of the students that we are discussing who had these incidences are special education students, and I think I need to make that clear.

195
00:16:52,176 --> 00:16:59,238
[SPEAKER_12]: Prior to the start of school, staff were not aware of any factors that would have helped them anticipate the behaviors of these students.

196
00:17:00,118 --> 00:17:08,241
[SPEAKER_12]: Both of them are linked to community supports, and staff is working to obtain information to expedite an educational evaluation.

197
00:17:09,358 --> 00:17:15,962
[SPEAKER_12]: The third grade teacher has been working very closely with the safety care team to address the needs of these children.

198
00:17:16,823 --> 00:17:26,209
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Johnson reviewed the school year mandates during the first weeks of school, such as he discussed de-escalation strategies and staying calm.

199
00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:33,173
[SPEAKER_12]: When the high intensity behaviors occurred in this classroom, students were evacuated

200
00:17:33,608 --> 00:17:39,353
[SPEAKER_12]: to the safety care team so that the safety care team could triage the situation.

201
00:17:40,714 --> 00:17:47,820
[SPEAKER_12]: The evacuations framed as academic movement opportunities for the children in the building, in that classroom.

202
00:17:48,641 --> 00:17:53,585
[SPEAKER_12]: More intensive incidences were not witnessed by the children, to my knowledge.

203
00:17:55,022 --> 00:17:58,525
[SPEAKER_12]: The Roberts School does have a lot of support in their building.

204
00:17:59,185 --> 00:18:02,347
[SPEAKER_12]: They have 19 safety care trained staff.

205
00:18:02,908 --> 00:18:11,394
[SPEAKER_12]: They have a full-time BCBA, a .5 school psychologist, and there's a full-time school adjustment Councilor as well in the building.

206
00:18:12,615 --> 00:18:15,437
[SPEAKER_12]: We do need to respect the privacy of the students.

207
00:18:15,998 --> 00:18:23,123
[SPEAKER_12]: We understand that this can be disruptive to the class, and we know that it can lead to disrupting the learning process.

208
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:43,621
[SPEAKER_12]: After speaking with the teacher, and I have been down to the Roberts School three times since the very first incident, she has assured me that she is on par with whatever she's teaching in English, literacy, math, and reading, and she does give her children homework.

209
00:18:44,722 --> 00:18:48,003
[SPEAKER_12]: We are organizing the following procedures for these children.

210
00:18:48,786 --> 00:18:51,949
[SPEAKER_12]: We're conducting risk threat assessments.

211
00:18:52,629 --> 00:18:55,772
[SPEAKER_12]: We will perform full evaluations of the students.

212
00:18:56,732 --> 00:19:01,216
[SPEAKER_12]: We're looking at creating an abbreviated schedules when the students return.

213
00:19:02,117 --> 00:19:05,580
[SPEAKER_12]: We will discuss and meet with community organizations.

214
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,744
[SPEAKER_12]: We will meet with the parents and we will provide additional support

215
00:19:11,695 --> 00:19:13,616
[SPEAKER_12]: in that classroom if need be.

216
00:19:14,477 --> 00:19:23,723
[SPEAKER_12]: I think Mrs. Rodriguez knows me especially well enough to know that we will get things in place as soon as possible.

217
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:36,451
[SPEAKER_12]: The teachers, the support staff, the assistant principal and the principal along with Kathy and I have been working diligently since we found out the information.

218
00:19:37,952 --> 00:19:39,433
[SPEAKER_12]: Safety is something that

219
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:46,508
[SPEAKER_12]: we definitely is first and foremost because children can't learn unless they feel safe in a classroom.

220
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,349
[SPEAKER_12]: I've discussed this with Ms.

221
00:19:49,369 --> 00:19:53,450
[SPEAKER_12]: Rodriguez and she knows now that the plan is in place to move forward.

222
00:19:54,671 --> 00:19:57,732
[SPEAKER_12]: Kathy?

223
00:19:58,012 --> 00:20:07,076
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd just like to mention around the enrollment of special education students at the Roberts is consistent with other buildings and in fact a couple of the other buildings are a little bit higher.

224
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:16,455
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that McGlynn has a few more students than over at the Roberts, but it is consistent across all of the schools, all of the elementary schools.

225
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:20,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

226
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:21,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Cuno.

227
00:20:22,067 --> 00:20:22,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

228
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:23,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Ms.

229
00:20:23,308 --> 00:20:26,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Rodriguez, to inform us of this situation.

230
00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:43,153
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess one of the questions I have is that I appreciate everybody doing this diligently the minute you found out about it, but I guess what goes back to me is the fact of if we have children, whether or not they were in the vicinity or not, rumors start.

231
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:47,194
[SPEAKER_03]: One story, you know, is a domino effect and becomes a larger story.

232
00:20:47,694 --> 00:21:14,902
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I guess for me is why weren't parents informed of not necessarily giving out the information because of confidentiality and things like that, but if the students were talking about this incident that occurred and then they went home and they were telling their parents, why wasn't something like at least sent out saying, you know, we understand what happened, this is what happened, it's not this story, it's not that story, it didn't get

233
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:29,030
[SPEAKER_03]: into a larger scenario, and I think maybe parents would have been a little bit more confident in the fact that they say, okay, the administration knows about it, the kids are talking about it, but let's see what the story is.

234
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:31,512
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess that's my biggest concern.

235
00:21:31,932 --> 00:21:41,199
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know in the past when things have happened, and even though everybody's been really diligent about putting a plan together, it's at that moment that at least we hope that

236
00:21:41,629 --> 00:22:07,784
[SPEAKER_03]: something goes out from the school saying we're very much aware what happened and you know and maybe even in that letter saying if there's a child who's having a hard time really understanding what's happening you know send them and we'll speak to them like have one of the Councilors speak to them on a one-to-one or something like that just to know that there's the help out there while everything is being placed in a process and I guess that's really my concern.

237
00:22:09,324 --> 00:22:16,031
[SPEAKER_03]: anybody who knows us is always talking about the most important thing, whether it's bad, good, or indifferent, is to make sure that we're all on the same page.

238
00:22:16,411 --> 00:22:20,195
[SPEAKER_03]: And that has to come from the top all the way to the bottom, including parents and students.

239
00:22:20,676 --> 00:22:30,646
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, students, especially if they're afraid and they hear something, even though they weren't there, are going to go home and they're going to change, the story is going to change.

240
00:22:30,686 --> 00:22:31,507
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying that the child

241
00:22:32,028 --> 00:22:37,419
[SPEAKER_03]: by any means is lying or anything like that, but they're in their panic mode and their emotions are high.

242
00:22:38,121 --> 00:22:40,566
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess that is my concern.

243
00:22:40,586 --> 00:22:42,550
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess the other concern is that, again,

244
00:22:43,098 --> 00:22:44,439
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate Ms.

245
00:22:44,459 --> 00:22:46,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Rodriguez coming and giving us the breakdown.

246
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:58,387
[SPEAKER_03]: But as a school committee member, I would like to have Mr. Johnson come and speak to us and let us know what's going on in the school with the numbers, what he has planned.

247
00:22:59,147 --> 00:23:02,349
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, this has nothing in reflection to Mr. Johnson.

248
00:23:02,469 --> 00:23:06,472
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that he is the principal and we need to get the information from him.

249
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:11,815
[SPEAKER_12]: We can certainly invite Mr. Johnson to the next school committee meeting if you would like that.

250
00:23:12,648 --> 00:23:15,730
[SPEAKER_12]: And to answer your question, I agree with you.

251
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:20,233
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that maybe something should have gone out to parents so that they were aware.

252
00:23:20,253 --> 00:23:22,254
[SPEAKER_12]: I had this discussion with Ms.

253
00:23:22,274 --> 00:23:35,062
[SPEAKER_12]: Rodriguez this evening, or even to have someone go into the classroom to talk to the children who are clearly upset by something that might have happened and wondering themselves what's going on.

254
00:23:37,564 --> 00:23:37,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Ms.

255
00:23:37,764 --> 00:23:38,164
[SPEAKER_01]: Vandekloot.

256
00:23:38,902 --> 00:23:45,706
[SPEAKER_01]: I share my colleague's concern about the lack of notification to the parents to let them know what had occurred at school that day.

257
00:23:46,126 --> 00:23:48,607
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to tell you that I still feel like I'm a little bit in the dark.

258
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:53,590
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand we very much want to protect the privacy of the students, but just a clarifying question.

259
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:57,992
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I to understand were these two students fighting with each other?

260
00:23:58,012 --> 00:23:59,312
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

261
00:23:59,993 --> 00:24:08,197
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a situation where there were two different students who experienced significant dysregulation

262
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:13,473
[SPEAKER_02]: during class time, which resulted in a call to the safety care team.

263
00:24:13,573 --> 00:24:14,975
[SPEAKER_02]: So on different days.

264
00:24:15,335 --> 00:24:16,936
[SPEAKER_01]: And they both happened to be in the same classroom.

265
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:21,459
[SPEAKER_02]: They both just happened to be in the same room, just random placement.

266
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,021
[SPEAKER_02]: And it happened multiple times.

267
00:24:24,102 --> 00:24:26,223
[SPEAKER_02]: So it felt magnified.

268
00:24:27,124 --> 00:24:30,346
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do want to also just mention just a slight correction.

269
00:24:30,767 --> 00:24:37,692
[SPEAKER_02]: When we spoke with the teacher and we spoke with Mr. Johnson and all the other staff at the school, they said none of the students have been restrained.

270
00:24:39,243 --> 00:24:42,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know there was a mention earlier about restraint.

271
00:24:42,925 --> 00:24:49,890
[SPEAKER_02]: So the level of disruption didn't call for that level of intervention.

272
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:56,595
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was settling things down, counseling, providing whatever support needed to be provided.

273
00:24:56,615 --> 00:24:58,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

274
00:24:58,977 --> 00:25:07,523
[SPEAKER_01]: Did the students on these occasions hit either their classmates or was there any physical

275
00:25:08,542 --> 00:25:19,047
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but I do believe there was a situation where she was thrown... I'm afraid to give too much information, I guess.

276
00:25:19,308 --> 00:25:19,528
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

277
00:25:21,506 --> 00:25:28,331
[SPEAKER_01]: So I also heard a mention of, and I know we had gotten a call about a student being taken out to the hospital.

278
00:25:28,371 --> 00:25:37,278
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that one of these students who was taken out because this is what was deemed to be needed to, were they physically?

279
00:25:37,298 --> 00:25:48,887
[SPEAKER_02]: So typically when, if a student becomes very upset and it's become obvious that the teacher or the classroom staff are having difficulty settling

280
00:25:49,398 --> 00:25:51,640
[SPEAKER_02]: a situation they call for, it's called the safety care team.

281
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:56,123
[SPEAKER_02]: So each of our buildings has a team whose job it is.

282
00:25:56,183 --> 00:25:58,185
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have other responsibilities within the building.

283
00:25:58,605 --> 00:26:06,691
[SPEAKER_02]: But when something like this occurs, they come to the aid of their colleagues and they provide additional support to students.

284
00:26:09,273 --> 00:26:17,880
[SPEAKER_02]: In many of those occasions, the school nurse is also involved in the triage of what the student's medical presentation and status is.

285
00:26:18,835 --> 00:26:22,577
[SPEAKER_02]: So occasionally I suppose it could result in a transport.

286
00:26:23,757 --> 00:26:25,798
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, but in this case there was a transport.

287
00:26:26,659 --> 00:26:38,885
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I had a child in this class I would have to say that I'd be very concerned because now they've witnessed two different kids have multiple incidents and would probably be concerned that my child would be thinking, what's next?

288
00:26:39,425 --> 00:26:45,368
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm wondering again, I realize how dicey it is around confidentiality, but

289
00:26:46,635 --> 00:26:48,616
[SPEAKER_01]: Have people gone in and talked to the kids?

290
00:26:48,676 --> 00:26:50,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Have there been any small groups talking to the kids?

291
00:26:51,258 --> 00:26:54,540
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounded like these kids are going to return to the classroom.

292
00:26:55,882 --> 00:26:59,804
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, as a parent, I can certainly understand why Ms.

293
00:26:59,824 --> 00:27:03,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Rodriguez would be concerned about what the plan going forth is.

294
00:27:04,488 --> 00:27:13,755
[SPEAKER_12]: So, yes, it was suggested that somebody go in and speak to the children, probably tomorrow, the adjustment Councilor.

295
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:14,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

296
00:27:16,837 --> 00:27:17,718
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's going to happen.

297
00:27:19,019 --> 00:27:24,084
[SPEAKER_01]: And have both kids been out or are they both going to be returning at the same time or do we have any?

298
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:30,790
[SPEAKER_12]: Both children are out right now, but we expect that they will be returning at some point this week.

299
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:34,353
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

300
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:56,169
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, I mean, I think the communication issue is key, and I think that the, obviously, and I hear you not being particularly definitive, and I understand why, but, you know, understanding how this is going to be resolved so that the kids aren't so fearful.

301
00:27:56,789 --> 00:27:56,929
[SPEAKER_01]: Ms.

302
00:27:56,949 --> 00:28:03,712
[SPEAKER_01]: Rodriguez speaks about her own daughter, but, you know, I can flash back and understand

303
00:28:04,092 --> 00:28:11,274
[SPEAKER_01]: what it was like to be a parent when something happened in a classroom, and know that kids do carry it with them sometimes.

304
00:28:11,534 --> 00:28:14,795
[SPEAKER_01]: And some kids carry it a lot more than others, and we have to worry about them.

305
00:28:14,895 --> 00:28:16,015
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am a little concerned.

306
00:28:16,856 --> 00:28:17,736
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I'm a lot concerned.

307
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:19,837
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand that, and I agree.

308
00:28:20,177 --> 00:28:31,400
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that also adults, in their effort to protect confidentiality and other just privacy needs, sometimes

309
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:37,228
[SPEAKER_02]: leave children with an incomplete story, so they fill in the blanks too.

310
00:28:37,288 --> 00:28:41,269
[SPEAKER_02]: So I agree that that's something that needs to be done.

311
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:52,913
[SPEAKER_12]: The teacher has been extremely supportive in talking, when I talked to the teacher today, she told me how she supported the children and talked to them.

312
00:28:54,884 --> 00:28:57,745
[SPEAKER_12]: and how she would keep them safe and that type of thing.

313
00:28:57,785 --> 00:29:00,746
[SPEAKER_12]: So she's a very empathetic, compassionate woman.

314
00:29:00,826 --> 00:29:05,948
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think she'll work with the kids as well as a school adjustment Councilor.

315
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:10,809
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Benedetto.

316
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:12,450
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

317
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:17,211
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm actually a safety care trainer as well at my school.

318
00:29:17,772 --> 00:29:24,614
[SPEAKER_16]: So I know a lot of it is de-escalation in removing the audience or the other children.

319
00:29:25,323 --> 00:29:30,025
[SPEAKER_16]: So that way they aren't traumatized as well as the person who is acting out.

320
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:36,189
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know that Medford Public Schools uses that, and I'm sure that they had the children move.

321
00:29:36,569 --> 00:29:45,854
[SPEAKER_16]: But I'm sure, as you stated, that your child probably witnessed stuff that made them nervous and anxious and a little afraid to go back to school.

322
00:29:46,454 --> 00:29:54,038
[SPEAKER_16]: So I know that in this report it says more intensive incidences were not witnessed, but

323
00:29:54,622 --> 00:29:58,484
[SPEAKER_16]: That's out of an adult's view of what happened.

324
00:29:58,744 --> 00:30:06,128
[SPEAKER_16]: And each individual adult will deal with different situations, and it will affect them differently.

325
00:30:06,188 --> 00:30:07,849
[SPEAKER_16]: And the same thing happens to children.

326
00:30:08,149 --> 00:30:15,693
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're hearing from parents that their child was affected by situations happening in their classroom.

327
00:30:16,033 --> 00:30:18,114
[SPEAKER_16]: So those parents, one, have to be notified.

328
00:30:18,614 --> 00:30:23,437
[SPEAKER_16]: Two, have to have counseling services to make sure that they feel safe coming back to school.

329
00:30:23,873 --> 00:30:25,794
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm glad that both those things are happening.

330
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:33,640
[SPEAKER_16]: The main issue I have, and I had this issue before this incident arose, was the number of students in the classes at the Brooks School.

331
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,982
[SPEAKER_16]: We talked about this when we got the graph.

332
00:30:36,362 --> 00:30:38,464
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's not about the type of children.

333
00:30:38,624 --> 00:30:42,046
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a high number for elementary school.

334
00:30:42,266 --> 00:30:46,389
[SPEAKER_16]: And I felt, I mean, I'm sorry, the Roberts School.

335
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:47,270
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, misspoke.

336
00:30:47,765 --> 00:30:54,648
[SPEAKER_16]: But the Roberts School's numbers were much, well not, they were higher than any other elementary school when I looked at this and I brought it up.

337
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:58,890
[SPEAKER_16]: At that point, it was the only school that had 24 students in any class.

338
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:11,096
[SPEAKER_16]: And I understand that some had 21 because of how Mr. Johnson, which I know why and how he does his class allocations, and I agree with how he does it.

339
00:31:12,396 --> 00:31:13,897
[SPEAKER_16]: Our job here,

340
00:31:14,808 --> 00:31:21,372
[SPEAKER_16]: is really to make sure we're prepared to meet the needs of all the children in our care.

341
00:31:22,272 --> 00:31:30,477
[SPEAKER_16]: That means all the children, children with disabilities, any child that walks through any classroom door, it's our responsibility that they are safe.

342
00:31:31,177 --> 00:31:33,499
[SPEAKER_16]: That's first, that's last, that's always.

343
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:36,300
[SPEAKER_16]: We're here to educate them, but we have to do that in a safe manner.

344
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,463
[SPEAKER_16]: And I believe that a lower class size might help to ensure that.

345
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:53,904
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm gonna ask the superintendent to look at that again, not at this moment, but I want him to go back with his team and really look at what's happening in this school and the population of the needs of the children within this school.

346
00:31:55,345 --> 00:32:07,074
[SPEAKER_16]: And just look at it with clear eyes and observation and really see if this, is the programming specific for the special education students at that school?

347
00:32:07,115 --> 00:32:09,817
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a type, you know, like I know at,

348
00:32:10,658 --> 00:32:13,260
[SPEAKER_16]: different schools, they have different populations of students.

349
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,862
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a specific population of students directed towards the Roberts?

350
00:32:18,062 --> 00:32:19,783
[SPEAKER_16]: I know the ELL students are there.

351
00:32:20,404 --> 00:32:25,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, each of our elementary schools house a strand of special education services.

352
00:32:25,547 --> 00:32:25,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

353
00:32:25,967 --> 00:32:27,248
[SPEAKER_02]: So the answer to that is yes.

354
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:28,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

355
00:32:28,248 --> 00:32:35,652
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, I just want to emphasize that this situation, none of the students involved were special education students.

356
00:32:35,812 --> 00:32:36,453
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good to know.

357
00:32:36,473 --> 00:32:40,155
[SPEAKER_02]: And the class, this particular classroom has 20 students enrolled in the classroom.

358
00:32:41,061 --> 00:32:42,622
[SPEAKER_12]: And we do have an additional teacher.

359
00:32:42,662 --> 00:32:44,363
[SPEAKER_12]: We made sure we had five classes.

360
00:32:45,003 --> 00:32:48,945
[SPEAKER_12]: So there is only 20 students in each of the classes.

361
00:32:49,045 --> 00:32:51,966
[SPEAKER_02]: And the classroom is staffed with a full-time paraprofessional.

362
00:32:52,406 --> 00:33:01,891
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was an unusual sort of situation that no one anticipated, that everyone has responded to, will continue to respond to this situation.

363
00:33:01,911 --> 00:33:05,953
[SPEAKER_02]: We will add additional staff if needed, and we will

364
00:33:06,987 --> 00:33:16,934
[SPEAKER_02]: address the concern regarding notification of parents and ensuring that parents know that counseling is available to their children should the children require such a support.

365
00:33:17,614 --> 00:33:25,119
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I think that's great, but I would really rather be proactive than reactive, especially in this situation.

366
00:33:25,479 --> 00:33:34,185
[SPEAKER_16]: So even a meeting, a night with the superintendent to the school or to the children affected or whoever needs to be there may be warranted.

367
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:46,129
[SPEAKER_16]: just to come and tell them what our plans are, so make sure that everybody is on the same page, and that they're notified face to face, and parents have a chance to voice any and all concerns.

368
00:33:46,229 --> 00:33:54,016
[SPEAKER_16]: I think hearing them might help us to develop what's best going to work, because they're the ones who are dropping off their children in our care every day.

369
00:33:56,335 --> 00:34:05,998
[SPEAKER_16]: So, are there a greater number of calls for safety care team at one school more so than another?

370
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:07,278
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we have those stats?

371
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,219
[SPEAKER_16]: There is, but not this fall.

372
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:15,240
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

373
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:24,662
[SPEAKER_16]: Just the information so we can decide whether we need to put more funding, more staff, what we need to do, that I'm not trying to, you know,

374
00:34:25,665 --> 00:34:46,863
[SPEAKER_16]: know specifics about students, but we need to know specifics about programs and if we're allocating enough staff and money to a situation and really don't want to go away from here and then something else happen that's even more involved or any, you know, situation because we didn't act.

375
00:34:48,108 --> 00:34:58,011
[SPEAKER_16]: So with that in mind, I'm asking the superintendent at this point to look at the class sizes again at the Brooks and the staffing, I mean the Roberts.

376
00:34:58,551 --> 00:35:00,031
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, I'm having one of those nights.

377
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:08,514
[SPEAKER_16]: At the Roberts and really look at it with an objective eye and keeping in mind the needs of the students and the population of the students.

378
00:35:09,074 --> 00:35:12,875
[SPEAKER_16]: Not only their, all their needs.

379
00:35:14,435 --> 00:35:14,735
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, 51%

380
00:35:19,132 --> 00:35:25,957
[SPEAKER_16]: low income, how many ELL students and special needs are in each room.

381
00:35:26,277 --> 00:35:30,941
[SPEAKER_16]: I really want to see that information looked at with an objective eye.

382
00:35:30,961 --> 00:35:34,063
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm sure you've looked at it once, but I'm asking you to look at it again.

383
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:36,745
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to ensure the safety of all the students.

384
00:35:37,066 --> 00:35:41,149
[SPEAKER_16]: And if things need to be shifted, let's not do it because that's where we've always done it.

385
00:35:41,649 --> 00:35:48,014
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's do what's right and move things or fix things or add another class or decrease the size for this year.

386
00:35:48,552 --> 00:36:03,595
[SPEAKER_16]: If we're seeing, you know, there are trends, just like with PARC or MCAS, you see one class does a little bit below one year, you look in the next year and see if they're doing a little bit below the next year, well maybe that class needs a little more academics.

387
00:36:03,735 --> 00:36:07,296
[SPEAKER_16]: So maybe this class needs a little bit more hands-on.

388
00:36:07,636 --> 00:36:15,638
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to look at trends and see if it will happen last year, if it's happening again this year, and look for those patterns so we can meet the needs of these students

389
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:16,819
[SPEAKER_16]: in the parents.

390
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:17,920
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

391
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,041
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Scurry, Madam Mayor.

392
00:36:20,961 --> 00:36:27,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, just like to say I echo the concerns of my colleagues and knowing that the Roberts is a tight knit community.

393
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:33,728
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm somewhat dismayed that the parents weren't contacted, you know, so that this incident could have been explained to them.

394
00:36:33,768 --> 00:36:43,613
[SPEAKER_06]: We've always worked on the premise of the home and school work in unison, and we're not fulfilling our part of the bargain if we don't contact people in a timely manner towards what's happening.

395
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:55,180
[SPEAKER_06]: I would suggest that the superintendent, if possible, could possibly have a meeting with the parents, meet with Mr. Johnson and the team to, you know, allay the fears of the children.

396
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:01,146
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want any child going to school, you know, under a cloud of not knowing what's going to happen next.

397
00:37:01,226 --> 00:37:04,810
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just think it would behoove us to, you know, work on the situation.

398
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Although it's an isolated incident,

399
00:37:07,971 --> 00:37:11,032
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we should repair it as quickly as possible.

400
00:37:11,092 --> 00:37:19,396
[SPEAKER_06]: And by that, I would strongly suggest that the administration do alert the parents in that class in general as to what happened.

401
00:37:19,416 --> 00:37:23,877
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they or their children have any questions, they should have a person they could contact.

402
00:37:23,957 --> 00:37:31,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Or we could have an evening where the parents that are concerned, that have fears for their children, could come in and they could be dismayed.

403
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:35,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Because once again, the Robertses are tight in the community.

404
00:37:36,033 --> 00:37:43,698
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, over the weekend we've heard two or three versions of the story, and I would rather see one concrete piece go out to the parents to allay their fears.

405
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:50,142
[SPEAKER_09]: So just if I can comment on that for a minute.

406
00:37:52,224 --> 00:37:55,486
[SPEAKER_09]: Situation happens, people are responding to it.

407
00:37:56,327 --> 00:38:01,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's not escalate it up and get more people feeling like there's something tragic going on.

408
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,030
[SPEAKER_09]: There isn't.

409
00:38:03,571 --> 00:38:04,052
[SPEAKER_09]: Some years,

410
00:38:05,024 --> 00:38:07,645
[SPEAKER_09]: A place like the Columbus had the therapeutic learning program.

411
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:10,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Some people used to call it the behavior management program.

412
00:38:10,667 --> 00:38:18,091
[SPEAKER_09]: And some of those youngsters had some serious issues and they were making noise and some people said, well, gee, you know, we're going to move those people.

413
00:38:18,952 --> 00:38:19,672
[SPEAKER_09]: We deal with it.

414
00:38:19,912 --> 00:38:20,693
[SPEAKER_09]: We work with it.

415
00:38:21,073 --> 00:38:22,453
[SPEAKER_09]: We will contact parents.

416
00:38:22,954 --> 00:38:24,014
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll meet with people.

417
00:38:24,395 --> 00:38:27,096
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll do what we have to do to allay the fears of students.

418
00:38:27,136 --> 00:38:29,697
[SPEAKER_09]: But let's not escalate it at this point in time.

419
00:38:30,158 --> 00:38:30,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's deal with it.

420
00:38:30,918 --> 00:38:34,260
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a situation that occurred in a single classroom

421
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:41,961
[SPEAKER_09]: a point in time at the beginning of the year, the two students who weren't on the radar, who aren't IEP students.

422
00:38:43,641 --> 00:38:50,123
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's find out, we'll do the diligence, we'll look at the makeup of the classes and make some recommendations.

423
00:38:50,583 --> 00:39:00,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's keep it calm and let's be surgical about it rather than try to raise and elevate concerns where they may not exist.

424
00:39:01,645 --> 00:39:03,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Some people may be more anxious than others.

425
00:39:04,028 --> 00:39:05,729
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll talk to people about it.

426
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:06,870
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll talk to people about it.

427
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:10,393
[SPEAKER_09]: But we did meet with Mrs. Rodriguez as she was coming to the microagent.

428
00:39:10,613 --> 00:39:11,594
[SPEAKER_09]: We did meet with her today.

429
00:39:11,714 --> 00:39:12,675
[SPEAKER_09]: We talked with her today.

430
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:14,116
[SPEAKER_09]: We will talk to other people.

431
00:39:14,617 --> 00:39:16,198
[SPEAKER_09]: But let's do it surgically.

432
00:39:16,238 --> 00:39:23,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do it directly that way rather than try to expand it.

433
00:39:23,384 --> 00:39:23,524
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

434
00:39:23,564 --> 00:39:26,786
[SPEAKER_17]: Mustone is next in queue.

435
00:39:27,607 --> 00:39:30,069
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to thank Cheryl for being here and for bringing those numbers.

436
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:44,364
[SPEAKER_10]: And the other part that we haven't even begun to address is the EL students, which I know my four-year-old takes speech therapy at the Roberts and his class that he was in last year was downsized because they needed that for EL students.

437
00:39:44,844 --> 00:39:46,745
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think I don't

438
00:39:47,387 --> 00:39:51,609
[SPEAKER_10]: have the education on special ed law, so I don't feel comfortable talking about that piece.

439
00:39:52,149 --> 00:40:04,195
[SPEAKER_10]: But for EL students, I think at one point in our pre-budget meetings, the director of EL had said possibly moving the older grades of EL students from the Roberts to another school.

440
00:40:04,696 --> 00:40:09,978
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that, Cheryl, you know the numbers better than I. What was the number of EL students at the Roberts?

441
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:09,978
92.

442
00:40:11,019 --> 00:40:12,680
[SPEAKER_00]: The last number I heard was 92.

443
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:22,636
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, so I think that's something that I feel more comfortable that's something that we could work on to have the older grades of EL.

444
00:40:23,897 --> 00:40:28,921
[SPEAKER_10]: I just am very uncomfortable talking about the special ed kids and their own lives, so.

445
00:40:29,941 --> 00:40:30,302
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

446
00:40:30,462 --> 00:40:30,622
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

447
00:40:30,642 --> 00:40:31,002
[SPEAKER_17]: Van der Kloot.

448
00:40:31,022 --> 00:40:33,444
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just reply to that.

449
00:40:33,684 --> 00:40:43,451
[SPEAKER_01]: The only problem with doing that is that we have ELL students then who have been at the Roberts for the younger grades, who have friendships, who are comfortable there, and now we're, you know,

450
00:40:44,207 --> 00:40:46,928
[SPEAKER_10]: No, because then they're pulled into regular ed, so they're not in the EL.

451
00:40:46,968 --> 00:40:49,329
[SPEAKER_10]: So if they came in, correct me if I'm wrong.

452
00:40:49,349 --> 00:40:50,509
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of information, Ms.

453
00:40:50,529 --> 00:40:50,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Stone.

454
00:40:51,129 --> 00:40:52,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Velson, correct me if I'm wrong.

455
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:59,252
[SPEAKER_10]: If they're in EL in first and second grade, then they, I mean, Teagan's best friend was in EL first and second grade, and then she was in a regular ed class.

456
00:40:59,512 --> 00:41:00,752
[SPEAKER_10]: She wasn't in the EL program.

457
00:41:01,012 --> 00:41:03,173
[SPEAKER_10]: So then she was in the class with them third, fourth, and fifth.

458
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:07,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but they would be moved out of that comfort.

459
00:41:07,794 --> 00:41:09,496
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, it's almost secondary.

460
00:41:10,197 --> 00:41:15,443
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Superintendent, I just have to say I disagree respectfully with you a little bit.

461
00:41:15,883 --> 00:41:18,186
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that the urge here is to up it.

462
00:41:18,586 --> 00:41:23,492
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think that all the school committee members heard that events happened last week.

463
00:41:23,905 --> 00:41:29,108
[SPEAKER_01]: And parents weren't notified, we're into a new week and we're looking back.

464
00:41:29,668 --> 00:41:37,873
[SPEAKER_01]: And parent notification when there were incidents in the classroom that were of this serious, I believe should have happened in a much more timely manner.

465
00:41:38,433 --> 00:41:40,735
[SPEAKER_01]: So because it didn't, it's harder to

466
00:41:41,638 --> 00:41:47,921
[SPEAKER_01]: feel great faith that everything will go forward in the best possible way.

467
00:41:48,262 --> 00:41:51,663
[SPEAKER_01]: Because for many of us, that's a stumbling block that we're hearing.

468
00:41:53,424 --> 00:41:55,305
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would like to make a motion.

469
00:41:55,345 --> 00:41:56,566
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard you saying you made a motion.

470
00:41:56,586 --> 00:41:57,126
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't hear it.

471
00:41:57,146 --> 00:41:58,587
[SPEAKER_17]: I have three motions right now.

472
00:41:58,607 --> 00:41:58,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Three motions.

473
00:41:59,007 --> 00:42:00,088
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe I could read them right now.

474
00:42:00,428 --> 00:42:01,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

475
00:42:01,028 --> 00:42:06,952
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Benedetto, motion review the allocation of all of the students in this third grade class.

476
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:07,852
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

477
00:42:07,952 --> 00:42:12,193
[SPEAKER_17]: Cugno, that Mr. Johnson appear at the next school committee meeting to address us on this topic.

478
00:42:12,753 --> 00:42:16,474
[SPEAKER_17]: And Mr. Skerry, that Mr. Johnson and the team meet with parents ASAP.

479
00:42:17,294 --> 00:42:19,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well my motion must be slightly different.

480
00:42:19,054 --> 00:42:22,435
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to make sure that this isn't falling through the cracks for us.

481
00:42:22,475 --> 00:42:34,258
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd like to make a motion to make sure that we receive a report at our next school committee meeting and at our meeting after that so that we have some ongoing understanding of what's going on.

482
00:42:34,698 --> 00:42:35,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.

483
00:42:35,918 --> 00:42:36,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

484
00:42:36,078 --> 00:42:36,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Cugno?

485
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:41,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'd like to basically reiterate what my colleague Paula just said.

486
00:42:42,222 --> 00:42:42,763
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think

487
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:48,115
[SPEAKER_03]: with all due respect, it's not the fact that we're trying to hype it or make it into a different story.

488
00:42:48,235 --> 00:42:58,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's just the fact, again, of something happening a week ago, or I don't know at this point if it was a week ago or two weeks ago, and putting myself in those shoes.

489
00:42:59,466 --> 00:43:06,613
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's something that we all have to think of, too, is that as we speak, we're always saying, you know, special needs,

490
00:43:07,193 --> 00:43:09,734
[SPEAKER_03]: and they have their confidentiality.

491
00:43:09,914 --> 00:43:28,282
[SPEAKER_03]: And even though we do have confidentiality for all students that come to our district, I think parents need to understand that when we're talking about confidentiality, we're talking about all students and not just the students that are in a particular group, because I think that is, again, extremely important.

492
00:43:29,003 --> 00:43:33,925
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, it's just basically the fact of I get

493
00:43:34,487 --> 00:43:41,692
[SPEAKER_03]: everything that's happened, but I think it was just the fear of listening to your child come home with different, you know, it happens to everyone.

494
00:43:41,732 --> 00:43:44,814
[SPEAKER_03]: It happens to whether you're young or even adults.

495
00:43:45,075 --> 00:43:48,357
[SPEAKER_03]: One person says one thing, and then another one adds on, and another one adds on.

496
00:43:48,497 --> 00:43:55,522
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a parent, you're home, you really don't know what's going on in the school itself because you weren't there, and now you have all these different stories.

497
00:43:55,912 --> 00:44:02,816
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, I mean, something should have come out from the school saying what had happened.

498
00:44:03,056 --> 00:44:11,460
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess my other thing, too, is that this is a very isolated situation with two students that happen to be in the same classroom.

499
00:44:12,341 --> 00:44:19,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Since it's already happened, is it possible or is it something to think about maybe trying to separate these two students?

500
00:44:19,585 --> 00:44:20,225
[SPEAKER_03]: That's in the works.

501
00:44:20,725 --> 00:44:21,005
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

502
00:44:21,245 --> 00:44:22,706
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

503
00:44:22,946 --> 00:44:23,627
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I need to know.

504
00:44:23,647 --> 00:44:23,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

505
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:26,609
[SPEAKER_16]: Final comments, Mr. Benedetto?

506
00:44:26,849 --> 00:44:32,014
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I want to second all the motions except for mine and move forward to put them on record.

507
00:44:32,174 --> 00:44:32,894
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's a second.

508
00:44:33,615 --> 00:44:36,878
[SPEAKER_17]: Would you like me to reread them, or are we all on the same page with them?

509
00:44:37,378 --> 00:44:43,063
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion for approval on all of the motions made, including a report update, be added to our school committee agenda.

510
00:44:43,763 --> 00:44:44,564
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

511
00:44:44,904 --> 00:44:44,984
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

512
00:44:45,445 --> 00:44:46,185
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

513
00:44:46,986 --> 00:44:47,667
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

514
00:44:48,307 --> 00:44:49,028
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

515
00:44:49,468 --> 00:44:50,909
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to clarify.

516
00:44:51,876 --> 00:44:53,276
[SPEAKER_00]: something about the incidences.

517
00:44:53,796 --> 00:44:56,297
[SPEAKER_00]: The latest and largest incident was last Monday.

518
00:44:56,357 --> 00:44:57,757
[SPEAKER_00]: It occurred in the cafeteria.

519
00:44:58,078 --> 00:45:01,298
[SPEAKER_00]: There were several incidences before and after.

520
00:45:02,819 --> 00:45:04,679
[SPEAKER_00]: And we never got notified of any of them.

521
00:45:04,799 --> 00:45:10,721
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason that I came forward and started speaking to people was because of the larger incident that had happened in the cafeteria.

522
00:45:11,101 --> 00:45:19,523
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I went through and spoke to the principal, and I spoke to Diane Caldwell, and I spoke to someone in the special needs department, and I spoke to Mr. Belson, and no one

523
00:45:20,263 --> 00:45:24,685
[SPEAKER_00]: had heard of any of the incidents other than the one that had happened in the cafeteria.

524
00:45:25,045 --> 00:45:35,150
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really concerning to me that these issues, maybe they don't know how to report them, who to report them, because these issues hadn't gone beyond the classroom or the safety team.

525
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:42,394
[SPEAKER_00]: No one else was aware of these instances, which is why I'm saying we really need to look at what's going on for the protocol and what we should do.

526
00:45:42,414 --> 00:45:43,114
[SPEAKER_17]: That will be dealt with.

527
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:44,175
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

528
00:45:44,355 --> 00:45:44,675
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

529
00:45:51,216 --> 00:45:57,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, tonight- To appear before us in the next meeting?

530
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:58,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

531
00:45:58,521 --> 00:46:02,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I would also like for him to have heads up on all the situations that Ms.

532
00:46:03,004 --> 00:46:10,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Rodriguez brought here, only because I don't want him to come here next week or two weeks, whatever, and say, gee, I'm not aware of it, I'll come back to you.

533
00:46:10,329 --> 00:46:12,970
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make it very fruitful.

534
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:13,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

535
00:46:15,352 --> 00:46:16,973
[SPEAKER_09]: No question in my mind they don't know about it.

536
00:46:18,179 --> 00:46:25,103
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, if I could, from the chair, I want to give some accolades out to Cache, who ran a fabulous event this past Saturday.

537
00:46:25,123 --> 00:46:26,744
[SPEAKER_17]: It was the Mystic River Celebration.

538
00:46:26,764 --> 00:46:28,966
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a family-friendly event.

539
00:46:29,046 --> 00:46:36,170
[SPEAKER_17]: Many of the parents and children I saw were there all afternoon with great music, great dance, great activities for the kids.

540
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:38,151
[SPEAKER_17]: So it was just a really beautiful event.

541
00:46:38,191 --> 00:46:44,095
[SPEAKER_17]: And I want to congratulate Laurel Siegel, Laura Beratin, the Medford Arts Council, Allie Fisk,

542
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:50,418
[SPEAKER_17]: and their major donor, Brookline Bank, for pulling off an amazing event that I hope everybody got to come to.

543
00:46:50,458 --> 00:46:52,940
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you didn't, make sure to put it on your calendar for next year.

544
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,221
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a fabulous day.

545
00:46:54,341 --> 00:46:56,902
[SPEAKER_17]: So kudos to Cachet for pulling that off.

546
00:46:58,423 --> 00:46:58,583
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

547
00:46:58,603 --> 00:46:59,384
[SPEAKER_17]: Vandercloot.

548
00:46:59,404 --> 00:47:11,611
[SPEAKER_01]: To mention that, I think that it's appropriate also to mention the wonderful celebration for the dedication of the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden and to thank everybody in your office who was responsible

549
00:47:12,804 --> 00:47:24,307
[SPEAKER_01]: to make it such a wonderful event, because it truly was great, and I know how much the people enjoyed it and appreciated it, and I felt very blessed to have been able to attend.

550
00:47:24,887 --> 00:47:25,967
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much, Paula.

551
00:47:26,167 --> 00:47:27,448
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a beautiful afternoon.

552
00:47:27,468 --> 00:47:41,251
[SPEAKER_17]: I think if we all heard one common theme, it was peace, and it was faith, and it was what gets you through the day, basically, and the things that these people endured is just horrendous, but there is a place now for people to reflect,

553
00:47:41,976 --> 00:47:44,819
[SPEAKER_17]: and meet and talk and look to the future.

554
00:47:44,919 --> 00:47:47,321
[SPEAKER_17]: So it was a very proud day for the city of Medford.

555
00:47:48,002 --> 00:47:53,247
[SPEAKER_17]: My staff did an amazing job, as did others in City Hall, DPW, the state.

556
00:47:53,327 --> 00:47:55,409
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, all hands were on deck for this event.

557
00:47:55,469 --> 00:47:57,831
[SPEAKER_17]: So it was quite a nice afternoon.

558
00:47:59,073 --> 00:47:59,333
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

559
00:48:04,465 --> 00:48:12,097
[SPEAKER_17]: And we have a special commendation for a lovely lady that is leaving our school district, so I'd like to ask Ms.

560
00:48:12,117 --> 00:48:13,540
[SPEAKER_17]: Padvilli to step forward.

561
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:42,546
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to say that we have had this woman in our school system for the last 35 years, but it's only been two years, three months, four days, and she has accomplished so much in such a little amount of time.

562
00:48:42,926 --> 00:48:44,447
[SPEAKER_17]: You're just an amazing woman.

563
00:48:44,908 --> 00:48:51,351
[SPEAKER_17]: You've brought some ingenious ideas to our school system, and you've certainly automated and made us a more productive system.

564
00:48:52,752 --> 00:48:55,234
[SPEAKER_17]: This doesn't even reflect how we all feel about you.

565
00:48:55,314 --> 00:48:56,174
[SPEAKER_17]: You know we adore you.

566
00:48:56,254 --> 00:48:57,455
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's congratulations.

567
00:48:57,475 --> 00:49:05,199
[SPEAKER_17]: The Metro Public Schools is proud to recognize Patricia Bailey for outstanding service as the Director of Administration and Finance, signed by all of us.

568
00:49:05,259 --> 00:49:07,780
[SPEAKER_17]: So we wish you the best in Minnesota?

569
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,921
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, Michigan!

570
00:49:11,055 --> 00:49:11,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Michigan.

571
00:49:11,676 --> 00:49:17,100
[SPEAKER_17]: And we know that you'll make another school system very proud.

572
00:49:19,721 --> 00:49:22,503
[SPEAKER_09]: So that she doesn't forget what's really important in life.

573
00:49:23,965 --> 00:49:26,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Here you go.

574
00:49:26,987 --> 00:49:30,449
[SPEAKER_09]: While you're watching those pitiful lions fight.

575
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay in touch.

576
00:49:33,652 --> 00:49:34,072
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

577
00:49:38,756 --> 00:49:39,897
[SPEAKER_17]: I know we've been trying.

578
00:49:40,117 --> 00:49:43,178
[SPEAKER_09]: We bought a bracelet so that she will find out where she is.

579
00:49:43,598 --> 00:49:45,399
[SPEAKER_17]: We've been trying really, really hard.

580
00:49:47,219 --> 00:49:50,561
[SPEAKER_17]: And just one other item, if you don't mind me taking it out of order.

581
00:49:52,221 --> 00:49:53,542
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll give it to you.

582
00:50:30,878 --> 00:50:33,481
[SPEAKER_17]: Would someone make a motion that we take item?

583
00:50:35,155 --> 00:50:36,256
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. Skerry.

584
00:50:36,636 --> 00:50:41,440
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion to suspend the rules to take paper number eight of the reports out of order.

585
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:43,961
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a report on Complete Streets.

586
00:50:44,722 --> 00:50:51,867
[SPEAKER_17]: I hope that the community is aware that the city of Metro was awarded $400,000 for Complete Streets projects within our community.

587
00:50:52,668 --> 00:51:03,816
[SPEAKER_17]: This was part of a community compact that we signed with the governor's office and the lieutenant governor, which allowed us to basically get $90,000 worth of grant money in order to do studies of our streets.

588
00:51:04,676 --> 00:51:16,282
[SPEAKER_17]: With that money, MAPC coordinated a team of traffic engineers and traffic advisors to come out and look at a lot of the issues that we are aware of and then to rank them based upon need.

589
00:51:17,122 --> 00:51:20,564
[SPEAKER_17]: Once we accomplished that, we had to put together a policy to submit to the state.

590
00:51:20,904 --> 00:51:24,786
[SPEAKER_17]: Once they approved, we were eligible for some extra points on our application.

591
00:51:25,206 --> 00:51:28,047
[SPEAKER_17]: We were awarded the full amount that you could for this process, which was $400,000.

592
00:51:29,698 --> 00:51:35,903
[SPEAKER_17]: The number one item on our list was the traffic walk in front of the Brooks School.

593
00:51:36,764 --> 00:51:42,989
[SPEAKER_17]: We realized that the width of that area is just a tremendous amount of space and it's a safety hazard.

594
00:51:43,429 --> 00:51:45,611
[SPEAKER_17]: And as recent as I think a week or so ago,

595
00:51:46,551 --> 00:51:50,194
[SPEAKER_17]: A child was grazed, but it could have been much worse.

596
00:51:50,354 --> 00:51:51,395
[SPEAKER_17]: It wasn't because of the width.

597
00:51:51,475 --> 00:51:52,676
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a glare issue.

598
00:51:53,137 --> 00:51:55,639
[SPEAKER_17]: But in any event, it's a very wide crosswalk.

599
00:51:56,299 --> 00:52:10,051
[SPEAKER_17]: So the people at the tool design, which was our traffic consultants, they went through and they looked at it and they made a host of recommendations for this project, including rapid flash beacons, which is basically if you were going to cross, you press the button

600
00:52:10,831 --> 00:52:21,216
[SPEAKER_17]: blinks go off on both sides, curb bump outs so that you're basically tightening the street, and a host of other signage and striping.

601
00:52:21,856 --> 00:52:29,379
[SPEAKER_17]: But in the interim, we're also going to be painting High Street because it is a very wide street going all the way down with cars being allowed to park in certain segments of it.

602
00:52:29,419 --> 00:52:36,782
[SPEAKER_17]: So we will be doing some immediate changes to the street to try and tighten it up a little bit and slow down the cars.

603
00:52:37,043 --> 00:52:38,003
[SPEAKER_17]: We know cars are an issue.

604
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:44,355
[SPEAKER_17]: The chief has guaranteed that he's going to have more enforcement on that street, and he will be addressing it.

605
00:52:44,696 --> 00:52:47,498
[SPEAKER_17]: But we had six items that were approved, one including Salem Street.

606
00:52:47,518 --> 00:52:50,721
[SPEAKER_17]: We're doing a traffic study in the Salem Street, Haines Square area.

607
00:52:51,362 --> 00:52:56,987
[SPEAKER_17]: Medford Square, we're tightening up the area in front of River Street.

608
00:52:57,428 --> 00:52:59,810
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to make that a tighter walkway as well.

609
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:02,672
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's a host of others in Southampton in front of Tufts Pool.

610
00:53:02,752 --> 00:53:05,874
[SPEAKER_17]: We know we have a very dangerous crossing section there as well.

611
00:53:06,514 --> 00:53:10,437
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you look up on the website, you can see the list of items that we're doing along with some analysis.

612
00:53:10,517 --> 00:53:12,578
[SPEAKER_17]: But we're just really proud to announce this.

613
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:19,583
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're also going to be looking at lowering the speed limits, which the state passed in August that the cities now have the authority to lower.

614
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:25,445
[SPEAKER_17]: the street mileage on roads before we couldn't touch state roads like Route 60, 16, 38.

615
00:53:26,547 --> 00:53:27,788
[SPEAKER_17]: And now they have passed that.

616
00:53:27,888 --> 00:53:28,609
[SPEAKER_17]: We are able to.

617
00:53:28,709 --> 00:53:30,230
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're very pleased about that.

618
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:32,793
[SPEAKER_17]: We've tried it in the past and they've come down and taken down our signs.

619
00:53:32,893 --> 00:53:36,697
[SPEAKER_17]: So we will be intensifying this process.

620
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:45,106
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm particularly happy to hear about the part which deals with the Brooks School.

621
00:53:45,466 --> 00:53:53,654
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a group of parents from the Brooks who have met with former Mayor Mike McGlynn, brought their concerns.

622
00:53:53,694 --> 00:53:58,619
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been an ongoing issue for some time and it's very good to see that there is a resolution

623
00:53:59,078 --> 00:54:00,939
[SPEAKER_17]: This intensifies this complete street.

624
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:04,581
[SPEAKER_17]: This funding source really does exemplify.

625
00:54:04,761 --> 00:54:05,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a timeline?

626
00:54:05,741 --> 00:54:08,143
[SPEAKER_17]: It has to be spent by June 30th.

627
00:54:08,323 --> 00:54:16,087
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have an engineer looking at the, when you do curb cuts, you have to have the proper radius and all of that.

628
00:54:16,147 --> 00:54:18,988
[SPEAKER_17]: So someone actually has to spec out the plans that have to go on the street.

629
00:54:19,048 --> 00:54:21,149
[SPEAKER_17]: So we'll be specing that out over the next month.

630
00:54:21,269 --> 00:54:22,150
[SPEAKER_17]: Money's in hand right now.

631
00:54:22,828 --> 00:54:27,329
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we'll be putting it out to bid to start as soon as winter's over, as soon as we're able to get in the ground.

632
00:54:27,469 --> 00:54:29,690
[SPEAKER_17]: And then it'll be done probably by April, May.

633
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:30,430
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.

634
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:31,590
[SPEAKER_17]: The long-term plan.

635
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:34,631
[SPEAKER_17]: The short-term striping, we're going to be getting on that very shortly.

636
00:54:35,051 --> 00:54:45,154
[SPEAKER_01]: And while we are under suspension, could I ask that we also address the addendum that we received this evening regarding the recommendation to accept a gift from Urban Sheds of Medford?

637
00:54:45,654 --> 00:54:46,334
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, certainly.

638
00:54:48,475 --> 00:54:49,255
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I'm sorry.

639
00:54:51,339 --> 00:54:51,979
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Benedetto.

640
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:54,961
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much, and I'm really glad that this is in place.

641
00:54:54,981 --> 00:55:10,290
[SPEAKER_16]: This is perfect timing, especially with the events that happened recently, and that we're going to put some corrections in place immediately and not wait for this to be completed.

642
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:12,091
[SPEAKER_16]: That was a concern from me.

643
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:20,496
[SPEAKER_16]: With this brought up a memory of an update, I need an update from the crossing guard on the Fellsway.

644
00:55:20,836 --> 00:55:23,758
[SPEAKER_16]: Did we ever figure that out with?

645
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:31,465
[SPEAKER_17]: We had a meeting Thursday with a lot of the team from City Hall, as well as some of the parents that were involved in the Brooke School.

646
00:55:32,065 --> 00:55:34,567
[SPEAKER_17]: And this issue was brought to our attention at that meeting.

647
00:55:34,587 --> 00:55:40,993
[SPEAKER_17]: And we also had Senator Jalen and Rep Garbally, who was going to speak to Rep Donato, it's his district.

648
00:55:41,393 --> 00:55:49,860
[SPEAKER_17]: And they were going to look into the DCR issues, because that's a DCR road, to see if they could, number one, get a crossing guard down at two locations on the Fellsway.

649
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:54,183
[SPEAKER_17]: So they were going to take that in their bailiwick, and they were going to address that.

650
00:55:54,443 --> 00:55:54,964
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, great.

651
00:55:55,024 --> 00:55:58,206
[SPEAKER_16]: Because we've been trying for that crossing guard for about a year now.

652
00:55:58,647 --> 00:56:00,288
[SPEAKER_16]: We've been asking about updates.

653
00:56:00,348 --> 00:56:02,750
[SPEAKER_16]: I know we've reached out to the DCR repeatedly.

654
00:56:03,225 --> 00:56:04,806
[SPEAKER_16]: and that we really weren't getting anywhere.

655
00:56:04,886 --> 00:56:08,449
[SPEAKER_16]: So before something happens there, I would like that addressed.

656
00:56:08,509 --> 00:56:14,653
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm glad that Rep Donato will be handling that because I think he'll do an excellent job and look forward.

657
00:56:15,514 --> 00:56:19,737
[SPEAKER_16]: Superintendent, could you please give us an update at our next meeting on that?

658
00:56:19,777 --> 00:56:21,238
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm making a motion to have a report.

659
00:56:23,438 --> 00:56:23,638
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

660
00:56:23,658 --> 00:56:33,664
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll make a motion to send to Rep Donato and Senator Jalen a request for a traffic guard at the crosswalk on the Fouse Way between Salem Street and Fulton Street.

661
00:56:35,085 --> 00:56:36,065
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe that's the correct?

662
00:56:36,646 --> 00:56:36,806
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

663
00:56:37,246 --> 00:56:39,507
[SPEAKER_09]: There have been several requests made.

664
00:56:39,567 --> 00:56:46,831
[SPEAKER_09]: This is not a new request and Representative Donato has run into a stone wall with DCR.

665
00:56:47,432 --> 00:56:49,873
[SPEAKER_09]: But if we get multiple

666
00:56:51,592 --> 00:56:54,613
[SPEAKER_09]: Reps requesting it, perhaps that will get a little bit more steam on it.

667
00:56:54,653 --> 00:56:57,693
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's been difficult because this is not a new request.

668
00:56:57,873 --> 00:56:59,074
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been making this request.

669
00:56:59,394 --> 00:56:59,734
[SPEAKER_09]: When St.

670
00:56:59,774 --> 00:57:03,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Francis closed, DCR determined it wasn't necessary.

671
00:57:03,735 --> 00:57:06,835
[SPEAKER_09]: But we think it's necessary, and we just have to keep banging away at it.

672
00:57:07,495 --> 00:57:09,536
[SPEAKER_09]: But that was part of the meeting the other day, so.

673
00:57:10,496 --> 00:57:10,916
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

674
00:57:10,976 --> 00:57:15,197
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to make that a form of a motion to our state delegation.

675
00:57:15,597 --> 00:57:17,157
[SPEAKER_17]: On that motion, all those in favor?

676
00:57:17,177 --> 00:57:17,518
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

677
00:57:17,698 --> 00:57:18,478
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

678
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:19,338
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion is passed.

679
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:21,620
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

680
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,081
[SPEAKER_17]: Kress, did you wish to speak?

681
00:57:23,301 --> 00:57:28,683
[SPEAKER_04]: I had written down the same exact question about the Fells Way because that was what we were talking about last school year.

682
00:57:29,183 --> 00:57:32,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I mean everything Erin mentioned was exactly what I had written down.

683
00:57:32,664 --> 00:57:36,785
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a great program and I'm so glad that we got that funding.

684
00:57:36,845 --> 00:57:40,507
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just terrific with all the crosswalks, so dangerous.

685
00:57:41,947 --> 00:57:48,750
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to know, Stephanie, do you know like in the square also where you cross over where Colleen Brighams is?

686
00:57:50,185 --> 00:57:52,547
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that's a really high traffic area also.

687
00:57:52,687 --> 00:57:56,409
[SPEAKER_04]: My mother actually got hit in that crosswalk a few years ago.

688
00:57:57,030 --> 00:58:03,735
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think there's a lot of traffic with people crossing over to go to Colleen's and over to the other side.

689
00:58:03,795 --> 00:58:06,356
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just seems like a really congested area.

690
00:58:06,417 --> 00:58:08,398
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted to just mention, I know it's not really

691
00:58:08,907 --> 00:58:11,948
[SPEAKER_04]: part of the school zone, but where the money was going to be funded.

692
00:58:11,968 --> 00:58:13,908
[SPEAKER_17]: Complete Streets isn't strictly a school zone area.

693
00:58:14,088 --> 00:58:14,748
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be anywhere.

694
00:58:14,768 --> 00:58:15,609
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted to mention that.

695
00:58:15,629 --> 00:58:20,310
[SPEAKER_17]: They went in and they evaluated the level of severity, and they came up with the list.

696
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:21,910
[SPEAKER_17]: It's professional, not the city.

697
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:23,350
[SPEAKER_17]: The professional engineers did.

698
00:58:23,811 --> 00:58:31,612
[SPEAKER_17]: So they've ranked them all, and the state basically took our first six plus a study, seven items, and that's what they funded.

699
00:58:31,772 --> 00:58:36,253
[SPEAKER_17]: So we'll be applying again for another grant, and we'll be going down that list and hitting more and more.

700
00:58:36,293 --> 00:58:37,934
[SPEAKER_17]: And then whatever we can accomplish on our own

701
00:58:39,072 --> 00:58:40,273
[SPEAKER_17]: striving to do that as well.

702
00:58:41,293 --> 00:58:45,635
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you know, has the traffic improved at the Brooks School?

703
00:58:46,456 --> 00:59:04,505
[SPEAKER_04]: I know they wanted to get police enforcement out there until something is in place, and I did talk to the crossing guard who does that section, and she said it's still really busy and people aren't stopping, or they're stopping, but then they're going.

704
00:59:04,952 --> 00:59:10,434
[SPEAKER_04]: and then they're stopping, you know, it's not like really, I don't know why, maybe because it's a busy section.

705
00:59:11,014 --> 00:59:16,516
[SPEAKER_17]: I just know whenever I go there and I use the crossing guard, the cars always stop.

706
00:59:16,556 --> 00:59:22,878
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know, we have a parent here in the audience that maybe she'd like to address, but I haven't seen that issue when the crossing guard is on premise.

707
00:59:22,998 --> 00:59:27,499
[SPEAKER_17]: The problem that I've heard is that when she's not there is when they have issues.

708
00:59:28,352 --> 00:59:31,596
[SPEAKER_17]: So the chief said he's going to do additional traffic enforcement.

709
00:59:31,616 --> 00:59:37,242
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to trim some trees as well so that people can see the sign that blasts what their speed limit is.

710
00:59:40,665 --> 00:59:47,789
[SPEAKER_17]: We think the issue is when we don't have a traffic guard.

711
00:59:48,509 --> 00:59:52,192
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, Elizabeth White, 288 High Street.

712
00:59:52,772 --> 01:00:03,158
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's especially bad when parents are leaving after school, if they're picking their kids up between the after school hours, 2.30 and 6, whenever they're getting their kids, and there have been incidents.

713
01:00:03,638 --> 01:00:05,740
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, no one's been hit, but it's just so wide.

714
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:11,844
[SPEAKER_13]: But typically, I mean, I think when Nicole is the crossing guard, when she's there, she does a phenomenal job.

715
01:00:12,224 --> 01:00:19,489
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've actually seen other people there who have replaced her, even police officers who don't do as good a job as she does.

716
01:00:19,629 --> 01:00:20,110
[SPEAKER_13]: She's excellent.

717
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:21,871
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

718
01:00:21,891 --> 01:00:22,832
[SPEAKER_17]: She'll be glad to hear that.

719
01:00:23,872 --> 01:00:24,353
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Ms.

720
01:00:24,373 --> 01:00:24,593
[SPEAKER_17]: Kreatz.

721
01:00:26,871 --> 01:00:37,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, echoing what has been previously said, but I was looking at the report and I just want to make sure that, I mean, first of all, I want to say, great.

722
01:00:38,323 --> 01:00:40,426
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the idea that we were able to get this funding.

723
01:00:41,066 --> 01:00:47,333
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that we are looking at the Roberts, I'm sorry, at the Brooks right now because especially the situation that occurred.

724
01:00:47,703 --> 01:00:51,084
[SPEAKER_03]: But my biggest fear is always I don't want to wait till a situation that occurs.

725
01:00:51,524 --> 01:01:05,688
[SPEAKER_03]: So I also want to make sure that we're looking at the high school on Winthrop Street, because even though we've been trying to put some signs and things up, again, there's a lot of trees that are, they're really low and you really can't see what you're putting on.

726
01:01:06,268 --> 01:01:09,109
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to make sure that we're also looking at Winthrop Street.

727
01:01:09,129 --> 01:01:12,830
[SPEAKER_17]: We can any time ask Forestry to turn some trees if they're sinking.

728
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:16,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and we want to make sure that we have the proper signage out there.

729
01:01:16,431 --> 01:01:17,351
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do that.

730
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:23,262
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion to receive and place on file this report, all those in favor?

731
01:01:23,783 --> 01:01:24,463
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

732
01:01:24,683 --> 01:01:25,464
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

733
01:01:26,985 --> 01:01:28,866
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion to revert to the regular order of business.

734
01:01:29,827 --> 01:01:30,567
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, no, not yet.

735
01:01:30,607 --> 01:01:30,867
[SPEAKER_17]: Hold it.

736
01:01:30,987 --> 01:01:31,868
[SPEAKER_17]: Hold it, Mr. Skerry.

737
01:01:32,208 --> 01:01:32,348
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

738
01:01:32,368 --> 01:01:33,289
[SPEAKER_17]: Vandekloot.

739
01:01:33,349 --> 01:01:38,773
[SPEAKER_01]: We received as an addendum in our packet a recommendation to accept gifts from Urban Sheds of Medford.

740
01:01:39,873 --> 01:01:42,255
[SPEAKER_01]: It asks that the Medford High School Garden Club

741
01:01:42,662 --> 01:01:47,124
[SPEAKER_01]: was asking permission to receive a donation of a garden shed from Urban Sheds of Medford.

742
01:01:48,424 --> 01:01:56,808
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to build, they've offered to build a custom four by six foot shed in the inner courtyard adjacent to the garden free of charge.

743
01:01:58,348 --> 01:02:07,892
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, it's signed by Rhetta Smith, the garden club supervisor, the biology teacher, and the Medford High School garden club members.

744
01:02:07,952 --> 01:02:11,734
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'd like to make a motion of approval that the garden,

745
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:18,004
[SPEAKER_01]: club be able to accept the gift of a shed from Urban Sheds, unless there's any concerns that I don't know about.

746
01:02:18,024 --> 01:02:19,665
[SPEAKER_17]: Does the school committee accept the gift?

747
01:02:20,805 --> 01:02:23,107
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Superintendent, does the school committee accept the gift?

748
01:02:23,127 --> 01:02:25,889
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a motion for approval, seconded by Mr. Skerry.

749
01:02:25,989 --> 01:02:26,449
[SPEAKER_17]: Roll call.

750
01:02:26,669 --> 01:02:27,370
[SPEAKER_17]: Roll call vote.

751
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:28,070
[SPEAKER_17]: It has to be, yes.

752
01:02:35,528 --> 01:02:36,329
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

753
01:02:36,850 --> 01:02:37,131
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

754
01:02:37,211 --> 01:02:38,654
[SPEAKER_17]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

755
01:02:38,674 --> 01:02:39,515
[SPEAKER_17]: The motion passes.

756
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:41,879
[SPEAKER_17]: I look for a one minute recess.

757
01:04:16,458 --> 01:04:20,205
[SPEAKER_16]: The next item on the agenda, reports from superintendent.

758
01:04:21,408 --> 01:04:26,237
[SPEAKER_16]: Recommendation to accept school supply backpacks from Aguero.

759
01:04:43,018 --> 01:04:53,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam Chairperson, we're going to call upon our assistant superintendent to deliver this report.

760
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:55,661
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's, I think it's my mic.

761
01:04:55,881 --> 01:04:56,981
[SPEAKER_04]: I think my mic is on.

762
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:05,443
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now everybody's mic is on.

763
01:05:06,663 --> 01:05:06,883
[SPEAKER_12]: We're on.

764
01:05:08,375 --> 01:05:35,681
[SPEAKER_12]: Medford Public Schools would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Sidney Wolk, founder of Agero, and the cross-country group, David Ferrick, CEO and president of Agero, Sandy Savage, the vice president of human resources, Sandy Reyes, human resource business partner, and all the members of the corporate giving committee for their generous donation of backpacks and other school supplies to our students.

765
01:05:36,521 --> 01:05:56,715
[SPEAKER_12]: Ajero donated more than 60 backpacks, three times what they gave us last year, filled to the brim with supplies that include educational games, composition notebooks, markers, rulers, pencils, glue sticks, binders, folders, lined paper, colored pencils, and highlighters.

766
01:05:57,615 --> 01:06:04,484
[SPEAKER_12]: These items have been distributed to our elementary schools and we had enough to distribute some of them to our middle schools as well.

767
01:06:05,065 --> 01:06:11,995
[SPEAKER_12]: In addition, pencils and spiral notebooks have been given to Medford High School and the Vocational High School.

768
01:06:13,242 --> 01:06:18,665
[SPEAKER_12]: Our principals have decided that the backpack should be disseminated to the most economically disadvantaged students.

769
01:06:19,185 --> 01:06:30,692
[SPEAKER_12]: And in fact, at our elementary schools, uh, the principals actually open and take all the supplies out and then the teachers can come and bring, bring them to their classrooms.

770
01:06:32,595 --> 01:06:38,738
[SPEAKER_12]: Principals and teachers and students and families were elated when they received their school supplies.

771
01:06:39,258 --> 01:06:47,703
[SPEAKER_12]: We are fortunate to have such generous community partners such as Ajero, who come to make such a difference in the lives of the children in our school district.

772
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:53,606
[SPEAKER_12]: I was hoping Mr. Sidney Wolk would be here tonight, but he is unavailable, and Ms.

773
01:06:53,626 --> 01:06:55,346
[SPEAKER_12]: Sandy Reyes is homesick.

774
01:06:55,947 --> 01:06:58,128
[SPEAKER_12]: Otherwise, we would have thanked them publicly for their gifts.

775
01:07:01,162 --> 01:07:13,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Madam Chair, could we please send a letter of thanks to them an appreciation from the school committee members?

776
01:07:13,712 --> 01:07:22,239
[SPEAKER_16]: Next item on the agenda report school screening brief intervention and referral to treatment.

777
01:07:28,633 --> 01:07:32,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam Chairperson, Tony Vento, our supervisor of health services is here.

778
01:07:33,418 --> 01:07:40,525
[SPEAKER_09]: We brought this to your attention last year when we got involved with the opiate intervention activities.

779
01:07:40,605 --> 01:07:46,210
[SPEAKER_09]: And Tony's going to bring you up to date on SBIRT, which is the acronym for this long title.

780
01:07:46,891 --> 01:07:50,294
[SPEAKER_09]: And let you know what we're doing and how it's going at this point in time.

781
01:07:51,775 --> 01:07:52,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

782
01:07:53,895 --> 01:08:03,301
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope everybody received one of the booklets that our team put together that really explains what SBIRT is and what the process for implementation will be.

783
01:08:04,162 --> 01:08:08,425
[SPEAKER_05]: This year in our high school and next year we'll expand to the middle schools.

784
01:08:09,365 --> 01:08:18,652
[SPEAKER_05]: So in January, Governor Baker signed an act relative to preventing adolescent substance abuse by expanding SBIRT.

785
01:08:19,352 --> 01:08:22,694
[SPEAKER_05]: And it mandates the use of a verbal screening tool for

786
01:08:24,168 --> 01:08:31,331
[SPEAKER_05]: adolescence in the school setting and starts with grade nine this school year and expands to grade seven next school year.

787
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:53,160
[SPEAKER_05]: And the act also provided funding to public school districts and Medford was fortunate to receive almost $15,000 that provided training for the high school nurses, the adjustment Councilors and guidance Councilors, and also permitted us to buy some resources that we would be able to use.

788
01:08:55,377 --> 01:08:57,499
[SPEAKER_05]: So SBIRT is a verbal screening tool.

789
01:08:57,859 --> 01:09:04,544
[SPEAKER_05]: It's evidence-based, it's used with adolescents, and it's administered during a private one-to-one conversation.

790
01:09:05,124 --> 01:09:19,314
[SPEAKER_05]: It consists of a few questions, and the goal is to promote prevention and identify early those students whose patterns of drug or alcohol use are presenting, putting their health at risk.

791
01:09:20,155 --> 01:09:24,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Use of the tool allows the screener to determine a level of risk.

792
01:09:25,157 --> 01:09:35,222
[SPEAKER_05]: For students who have a very low level of risk, the screener will support and encourage their positive, healthy decision making and lifestyle.

793
01:09:36,462 --> 01:09:46,287
[SPEAKER_05]: For students who screen higher level of risk, the screener will either provide a brief intervention or the highest level would provide referral to treatment.

794
01:09:46,827 --> 01:09:48,888
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a tiered level of approach.

795
01:09:51,790 --> 01:09:56,412
[SPEAKER_05]: The screening entails students meeting with a trained screener.

796
01:09:56,833 --> 01:09:57,913
[SPEAKER_05]: They meet one to one.

797
01:09:57,953 --> 01:10:02,796
[SPEAKER_05]: We are taking them out of either health ed or physical education classes.

798
01:10:03,476 --> 01:10:20,245
[SPEAKER_05]: And the screener will go through the six questions and then make a decision on whether it's just that we're saying, great, you're doing a wonderful job, you're making good choices, or probing a little bit further with the students.

799
01:10:21,581 --> 01:10:27,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Students and parents have the option of opting out by submitting a letter.

800
01:10:27,665 --> 01:10:36,590
[SPEAKER_05]: And we will be notifying parents during the fall that we will be starting these screenings.

801
01:10:37,371 --> 01:10:39,392
[SPEAKER_05]: That letter is included in the booklet.

802
01:10:40,873 --> 01:10:43,074
[SPEAKER_05]: All the interviews are confidential.

803
01:10:43,554 --> 01:10:49,218
[SPEAKER_05]: No results will be placed in any student records and

804
01:10:50,178 --> 01:10:54,800
[SPEAKER_05]: permission to disclose the information can only be granted by the student.

805
01:10:55,140 --> 01:11:06,524
[SPEAKER_05]: So students will be informed that if their health is at risk, if we are really concerned, then we will reach out for referral to treatment or we would reach out to parents.

806
01:11:06,564 --> 01:11:10,165
[SPEAKER_05]: So that will be made known to the student at the beginning of the screening.

807
01:11:11,525 --> 01:11:15,847
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's no disciplinary action associated with any results of the screening.

808
01:11:16,127 --> 01:11:18,668
[SPEAKER_05]: The goal is really identification and

809
01:11:19,512 --> 01:11:20,353
[SPEAKER_05]: harm reduction.

810
01:11:22,775 --> 01:11:23,775
[SPEAKER_05]: So where are we now?

811
01:11:24,736 --> 01:11:26,598
[SPEAKER_05]: The staff has been trained.

812
01:11:26,718 --> 01:11:29,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Last spring, the staff at the high school was trained.

813
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:36,525
[SPEAKER_05]: We convened a small team that worked together to pull together the resources in that booklet.

814
01:11:37,866 --> 01:11:48,474
[SPEAKER_05]: We are looking at this fall, we'll be setting up the schedules for how to pull students out of class, and we expect to begin the screening in mid-January.

815
01:11:52,572 --> 01:11:54,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, does anybody have any questions?

816
01:11:59,494 --> 01:12:01,855
[SPEAKER_01]: So I read through the material and I just wanted to be clear.

817
01:12:02,475 --> 01:12:11,998
[SPEAKER_01]: So if a student does reveal information which is alarming, they will be told that what they're saying is not confidential.

818
01:12:12,879 --> 01:12:14,919
[SPEAKER_05]: It depends on the level of harm risk.

819
01:12:18,106 --> 01:12:22,189
[SPEAKER_05]: At the highest level, yes, the student would be told, I'm concerned about you.

820
01:12:22,249 --> 01:12:26,451
[SPEAKER_05]: You're putting yourself or others at danger, depending on the answers on the questionnaire.

821
01:12:27,872 --> 01:12:30,253
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to refer you on for further treatment.

822
01:12:30,594 --> 01:12:36,937
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel it would be beneficial to inform your parents, because we will be an alliance to making sure that you get that treatment.

823
01:12:37,938 --> 01:12:44,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Students do have the option of refusing, and that's all part of the process of

824
01:12:46,933 --> 01:12:54,358
[SPEAKER_05]: coming to terms with your degree of substance abuse and your readiness for treatment.

825
01:12:57,579 --> 01:13:00,841
[SPEAKER_05]: But that all follows the models of the SBIRT program.

826
01:13:01,762 --> 01:13:09,527
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I was thinking in particular about one of the questions was about getting into, have you ever driven with anybody who's under the influence?

827
01:13:09,707 --> 01:13:11,088
[SPEAKER_01]: And if a student says yes,

828
01:13:12,147 --> 01:13:16,329
[SPEAKER_05]: And that brings a whole different level to that.

829
01:13:17,370 --> 01:13:22,312
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think there would be further investigation and the team would have to decide where you go with that.

830
01:13:22,372 --> 01:13:25,533
[SPEAKER_05]: It may be referring to Department of Children and Families.

831
01:13:26,534 --> 01:13:28,235
[SPEAKER_05]: It may be a conversation with the parent.

832
01:13:28,275 --> 01:13:30,556
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it will lead to different levels.

833
01:13:30,876 --> 01:13:34,698
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be very interested in hearing how this all works out and what the response is.

834
01:13:35,198 --> 01:13:35,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

835
01:13:35,698 --> 01:13:39,540
[SPEAKER_05]: From the experience that I've heard about in other districts that are using it.

836
01:13:40,534 --> 01:13:47,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Natick is using the model, Gloucester, North Andover, Bill Ricka.

837
01:13:48,078 --> 01:13:54,081
[SPEAKER_05]: They have found very low numbers of students that need referral on for high level treatment.

838
01:13:54,422 --> 01:14:05,808
[SPEAKER_05]: If we get them early, seventh to ninth grade, we do really more education and prevention than we do identification of significant illness.

839
01:14:06,802 --> 01:14:10,943
[SPEAKER_05]: building good, positive, healthy decision-making.

840
01:14:12,704 --> 01:14:17,285
[SPEAKER_16]: I have a few questions from the podium.

841
01:14:17,825 --> 01:14:25,968
[SPEAKER_16]: My first is, are the children told that the outcome may not be confidential before they begin?

842
01:14:26,048 --> 01:14:26,528
[SPEAKER_16]: They will be.

843
01:14:31,237 --> 01:14:34,080
[SPEAKER_16]: Are we sending the opt-out form to parents?

844
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:37,323
[SPEAKER_16]: Are we sending them a form if you don't want your child to?

845
01:14:37,443 --> 01:14:43,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we have a letter that gives them instructions if they would like to opt out, how they go about doing that.

846
01:14:43,908 --> 01:14:47,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, it's not like a cut off on the bottom that they could just send back?

847
01:14:47,792 --> 01:14:47,972
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.

848
01:14:48,032 --> 01:14:48,773
[SPEAKER_05]: They email us.

849
01:14:49,233 --> 01:14:50,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

850
01:14:50,214 --> 01:14:54,397
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when we set up the schedules, then we'll take that into account.

851
01:14:54,437 --> 01:14:57,280
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll remove those children whose parents have opted out.

852
01:14:57,872 --> 01:15:00,633
[SPEAKER_16]: or a phone number for parents that don't have easy access.

853
01:15:00,873 --> 01:15:02,013
[SPEAKER_05]: That should be in there as well.

854
01:15:02,353 --> 01:15:02,673
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

855
01:15:03,173 --> 01:15:06,474
[SPEAKER_16]: And then my last question is about staffing.

856
01:15:06,994 --> 01:15:17,476
[SPEAKER_16]: So our nursing department is really going to be taking care of this, and I know our nurses work extremely hard already, and this is a new initiative for them to undertake.

857
01:15:18,156 --> 01:15:20,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's doing their job while they're doing this?

858
01:15:20,156 --> 01:15:23,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we will be tag teaming nurses and Councilors.

859
01:15:23,897 --> 01:15:25,577
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we set up the schedule,

860
01:15:26,515 --> 01:15:33,341
[SPEAKER_05]: We look to set up two nurses and two Councilors pulling students out of the classes.

861
01:15:34,262 --> 01:15:43,449
[SPEAKER_05]: That leaves, at the high school, one nurse in the high school office, along with me, unless I become one of the school nurses.

862
01:15:43,469 --> 01:15:45,791
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we will be adequately covered.

863
01:15:47,372 --> 01:15:50,315
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have considered that, and the same with the Councilors.

864
01:15:50,795 --> 01:15:54,999
[SPEAKER_05]: If we have a plan set up ahead of time, they can adjust some of their schedules so

865
01:15:56,087 --> 01:15:57,268
[SPEAKER_05]: their freedom to do that.

866
01:15:58,009 --> 01:16:03,434
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, and if not, is there budgetary funds allotted with this to get a sub-nurse in?

867
01:16:03,634 --> 01:16:04,255
[SPEAKER_05]: There is not.

868
01:16:04,555 --> 01:16:06,977
[SPEAKER_05]: The funds were specifically for training.

869
01:16:07,958 --> 01:16:09,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, all right.

870
01:16:09,319 --> 01:16:15,525
[SPEAKER_05]: So we will be looking to do this without the use of substitutes if possible.

871
01:16:15,605 --> 01:16:19,228
[SPEAKER_05]: It will be all about very succinct planning.

872
01:16:19,845 --> 01:16:23,167
[SPEAKER_16]: So my request is that you track that and how many.

873
01:16:23,968 --> 01:16:24,589
[SPEAKER_16]: Absolutely.

874
01:16:25,049 --> 01:16:30,433
[SPEAKER_16]: How much coverage one nurse is taking on and the increase in incidents.

875
01:16:30,513 --> 01:16:35,917
[SPEAKER_16]: So we make sure that we're covered well because we have a lot of students with a lot of different needs.

876
01:16:36,017 --> 01:16:36,697
[SPEAKER_16]: Absolutely.

877
01:16:37,038 --> 01:16:40,480
[SPEAKER_16]: So I want to make sure that all students are safe while we're planning to do this.

878
01:16:40,961 --> 01:16:41,681
[SPEAKER_16]: Any other questions?

879
01:16:41,961 --> 01:16:42,562
[SPEAKER_16]: Mrs. Cugno.

880
01:16:43,112 --> 01:16:43,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

881
01:16:43,832 --> 01:17:01,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I guess the thing is that when you said that parents are going to be asked if their children want to opt out or not, and then you also mentioned that if the student decides to do this, they will be informed that depending on the level, some of the information will not be confidential.

882
01:17:01,964 --> 01:17:02,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

883
01:17:02,465 --> 01:17:09,149
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess in between that, is there something, is there a form that they're going to sign saying that you definitely inform them?

884
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:11,891
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that, that, um,

885
01:17:12,785 --> 01:17:15,927
[SPEAKER_05]: That is not, we don't have that looked into it.

886
01:17:16,447 --> 01:17:27,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Because my concern is that if we say it verbally, if something comes out that the child doesn't want really to be exposed, they could turn around and say that they were never told.

887
01:17:28,513 --> 01:17:35,956
[SPEAKER_03]: My other concern is also if the child is 18 years old and older or if the child is 18 and younger.

888
01:17:36,317 --> 01:17:39,158
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's all students have the ability to opt out.

889
01:17:39,892 --> 01:17:42,373
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but I'm talking about if there was a form.

890
01:17:42,433 --> 01:17:43,394
[SPEAKER_03]: All a form, right.

891
01:17:43,454 --> 01:17:51,258
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's some type of form that they have to sign, releasing the fact that they know the outcome, if it's going to be higher, it's not going to be confidential.

892
01:17:51,838 --> 01:17:57,561
[SPEAKER_03]: If the student is 17 years old and they sign the form, then the parents need to sign that form.

893
01:17:58,822 --> 01:18:05,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, the way the state has set this up, students older than 14 can give consent or opt out.

894
01:18:09,133 --> 01:18:16,599
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that little piece of confidentiality, because they could at that moment say, sure, I'll give you, you know, you ask me and I'll do it.

895
01:18:16,639 --> 01:18:30,069
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just in case they don't like the, I don't want to say reaction or the restriction from it, I don't want us to be liable saying it's a he said, she said situation.

896
01:18:30,229 --> 01:18:30,750
[SPEAKER_05]: We can do that.

897
01:18:30,770 --> 01:18:38,796
[SPEAKER_05]: We can put together a student form that if a student says, no, I don't want to do this, we can ask them to sign it.

898
01:18:41,763 --> 01:18:45,104
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to accept the paper and put it on file.

899
01:18:45,245 --> 01:18:45,925
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion so moved.

900
01:18:45,945 --> 01:18:51,467
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for all your work, Tony.

901
01:18:51,487 --> 01:18:52,027
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

902
01:18:52,428 --> 01:18:53,968
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for all the work.

903
01:18:57,490 --> 01:19:01,291
[SPEAKER_16]: Report on district priority educational costs, SY 2016-2017.

904
01:19:01,331 --> 01:19:09,215
[SPEAKER_09]: So at this time, we'll call upon our deputy superintendent to present this report.

905
01:19:12,385 --> 01:19:12,845
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

906
01:19:13,506 --> 01:19:17,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Every year we set educational goals, priority goals.

907
01:19:17,788 --> 01:19:21,471
[SPEAKER_11]: I know there are a lot of different categories of goals for school system.

908
01:19:21,511 --> 01:19:24,372
[SPEAKER_11]: These really deal with the educational elements.

909
01:19:24,412 --> 01:19:30,696
[SPEAKER_11]: And the reason why we get this out really early is because it's tied into the teacher evaluation system.

910
01:19:31,637 --> 01:19:39,822
[SPEAKER_11]: Every teacher starting right now is formulating his or her own educational goals, which is part of the requirement.

911
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:49,445
[SPEAKER_11]: for their evaluation, they're supposed to be establishing one professional growth goal and one student performance goal.

912
01:19:49,805 --> 01:19:53,887
[SPEAKER_11]: And these are in the form of SMART goals so that they're measurable.

913
01:19:53,967 --> 01:19:56,768
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, they've been doing this now for a few years.

914
01:19:58,009 --> 01:20:07,814
[SPEAKER_11]: So each year, what we do is we take the goals we've had the previous year and we take a look at how well we've accomplished those goals.

915
01:20:08,234 --> 01:20:09,815
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Riccadeli is here tonight.

916
01:20:10,708 --> 01:20:13,529
[SPEAKER_11]: She and I kind of worked on this report collaboratively.

917
01:20:14,129 --> 01:20:23,913
[SPEAKER_11]: She took the goals from last year and just took a look and went to different people responsible for different areas to see how well the goals were met.

918
01:20:23,933 --> 01:20:30,916
[SPEAKER_11]: I think in most cases, you will see from what she reported out that we did meet the goals.

919
01:20:30,956 --> 01:20:37,398
[SPEAKER_11]: We have, again, the district priority goals and then within each district priority goal, there are a number of SMART goals.

920
01:20:38,370 --> 01:20:47,893
[SPEAKER_11]: And then with that, we met again with the administrators, got their input as we began to update the goals for this year.

921
01:20:48,173 --> 01:20:55,576
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, I'm just going to call your attention to just a few of the things that we updated.

922
01:20:55,596 --> 01:20:57,416
[SPEAKER_11]: One second.

923
01:20:57,436 --> 01:21:03,098
[SPEAKER_11]: So, with regard to

924
01:21:07,415 --> 01:21:17,759
[SPEAKER_11]: District Priority Goal 1 under B, we added another item to the technology piece, and that was informational literacy.

925
01:21:18,199 --> 01:21:22,881
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's a different bullet if you were to compare the previous year's goals to these new goals.

926
01:21:24,141 --> 01:21:32,444
[SPEAKER_11]: The district SMART goals for District Priority Goal 1 under 1 that have to do with professional development.

927
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:42,345
[SPEAKER_11]: A, B, and C, special education strategies, working effectively with at risk students and social emotional learning.

928
01:21:42,825 --> 01:21:49,429
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are the main areas that our new professional development committee identified as being important.

929
01:21:49,489 --> 01:21:59,315
[SPEAKER_11]: So we felt that we should incorporate what that committee did in terms of making those focal points for professional development.

930
01:21:59,355 --> 01:22:02,637
[SPEAKER_11]: We also added under district priority goal two,

931
01:22:03,878 --> 01:22:10,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Rather than talk about the negative things, suspensions, we wanted to focus on positive.

932
01:22:11,485 --> 01:22:25,156
[SPEAKER_11]: So under District SMART Goals 3, under Goal 2, the district will design and offer alternative educational opportunities for students providing for credit recovery and positive behavioral supports.

933
01:22:25,616 --> 01:22:30,760
[SPEAKER_11]: So that language was made to be a little bit more positive.

934
01:22:31,501 --> 01:22:32,702
[SPEAKER_11]: We added a fourth.

935
01:22:33,335 --> 01:22:40,039
[SPEAKER_11]: item to that particular goal because we know this is one that's been very important this past year.

936
01:22:40,119 --> 01:22:43,861
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to make sure that we focus a lot of attention on it.

937
01:22:44,401 --> 01:22:55,427
[SPEAKER_11]: And that fourth one is the district will continue to promote programs and initiatives that seek to educate students on issues related to substance abuse.

938
01:22:55,787 --> 01:23:00,270
[SPEAKER_11]: So we wanted to make sure that that was clearly delineated as a separate entity.

939
01:23:02,347 --> 01:23:03,728
[SPEAKER_11]: District priority goal three.

940
01:23:04,289 --> 01:23:10,074
[SPEAKER_11]: In the past couple of years, we focused on English and mathematics, because those were the newest frameworks.

941
01:23:10,594 --> 01:23:18,080
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, we were aligning our curriculum, we were purchasing our materials to reflect those changes and those frameworks.

942
01:23:18,741 --> 01:23:20,402
[SPEAKER_11]: We feel we've made a lot of progress.

943
01:23:20,523 --> 01:23:23,585
[SPEAKER_11]: As you know, the committee has supported materials at the elementary level.

944
01:23:24,426 --> 01:23:28,129
[SPEAKER_11]: The directors have done a lot of work on working with the standards,

945
01:23:29,708 --> 01:23:33,489
[SPEAKER_11]: standards for each grade level are taught and that they are supported.

946
01:23:34,309 --> 01:23:39,110
[SPEAKER_11]: This year we have a new framework to be concerned about and that is the science frameworks.

947
01:23:39,570 --> 01:23:54,512
[SPEAKER_11]: They were just adopted last spring and again our focus this year under District Priority Goal 3, which deals with curriculum, is to focus on these new frameworks for science and engineering.

948
01:23:55,312 --> 01:23:59,053
[SPEAKER_11]: But that doesn't mean we're going to forget about English and math because again we're still working on

949
01:23:59,705 --> 01:24:05,208
[SPEAKER_11]: different units of instruction, but again, these were the newest ones that we need to pay attention to.

950
01:24:06,568 --> 01:24:15,853
[SPEAKER_11]: We will continue to support our curriculum with materials, and we come to the committee every year asking for different materials to support the curriculum.

951
01:24:15,873 --> 01:24:26,778
[SPEAKER_11]: And we are still updating the curriculum areas that have no recent, or actually their frameworks are quite old, and what we do is we look to other sources.

952
01:24:26,818 --> 01:24:27,578
[SPEAKER_11]: So for example,

953
01:24:28,086 --> 01:24:32,909
[SPEAKER_11]: The frameworks for health education, the last ones were written in 1999.

954
01:24:33,510 --> 01:24:45,978
[SPEAKER_11]: There are a lot of health issues that are post-1999, so we look to our health supervisor to make sure that what's being taught in classrooms is reflective of the health needs of youngsters in 2016.

955
01:24:47,599 --> 01:24:50,821
[SPEAKER_11]: We look to national standards, for example, to help us out.

956
01:24:51,281 --> 01:24:56,985
[SPEAKER_11]: We have the Michigan model, as you know, the new curriculum for health, which focuses on

957
01:24:57,488 --> 01:24:58,708
[SPEAKER_11]: a lot of these new topics.

958
01:24:59,228 --> 01:25:00,789
[SPEAKER_11]: The same is true for foreign language.

959
01:25:00,829 --> 01:25:03,729
[SPEAKER_11]: Those frameworks, the last iteration of those was 1999.

960
01:25:03,929 --> 01:25:06,130
[SPEAKER_11]: They haven't updated them.

961
01:25:06,370 --> 01:25:08,950
[SPEAKER_11]: They haven't updated the fine arts.

962
01:25:09,470 --> 01:25:15,331
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, we are attentive to those simply because the state doesn't choose to update them doesn't mean the district doesn't.

963
01:25:15,371 --> 01:25:24,533
[SPEAKER_11]: So those directors are at work looking at seeing what's happened up to date and making sure that those items are incorporated in our own curriculum areas.

964
01:25:25,822 --> 01:25:35,104
[SPEAKER_11]: As we move along, District Priority Goal 4, we've changed the language to reflect the new upcoming test, which is MCAS 2.0.

965
01:25:35,644 --> 01:25:43,546
[SPEAKER_11]: And we anticipate that that will be the test that youngsters are being assessed with this coming spring.

966
01:25:44,106 --> 01:25:53,128
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, we took out the old language of the old MCAS and the park, and we know this will be the only test that will be mandated by the state.

967
01:25:54,613 --> 01:26:04,038
[SPEAKER_11]: The whole language on district determined measures, DDMs, which were assessments that we were supposed to be developing.

968
01:26:04,098 --> 01:26:10,401
[SPEAKER_11]: We did develop them, and teachers were supposed to be using them as part of their own evaluation.

969
01:26:10,821 --> 01:26:14,023
[SPEAKER_11]: The state has kind of gone backward a little bit on that.

970
01:26:14,123 --> 01:26:20,506
[SPEAKER_11]: And even though they are not quite sure that we will be using those for teacher evaluation,

971
01:26:22,768 --> 01:26:28,010
[SPEAKER_11]: common assessments that are standard for different courses, that's a good idea.

972
01:26:28,110 --> 01:26:32,612
[SPEAKER_11]: So we renamed the DDM's common assessments.

973
01:26:33,233 --> 01:26:38,255
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so again, we're still working on them and just changing a little bit of the language.

974
01:26:39,656 --> 01:26:47,119
[SPEAKER_11]: And moving ahead, district priority goal five under district SMART goal number three.

975
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,721
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, the positive behavior

976
01:26:52,148 --> 01:26:55,591
[SPEAKER_11]: that we want to emphasize is reflected in that goal as well.

977
01:26:56,352 --> 01:27:20,492
[SPEAKER_11]: District priority goal number six, again, we put in language that, under goal one, that is reflective of what the professional development committee suggested we focus our areas on, and that would be, again, special education strategies, working effectively with at-risk students, and social and emotional learning.

978
01:27:20,943 --> 01:27:22,764
[SPEAKER_11]: So we incorporated that language.

979
01:27:23,844 --> 01:27:35,809
[SPEAKER_11]: And the last district goal seven, we re-emphasized the increase in online communication.

980
01:27:35,829 --> 01:27:43,812
[SPEAKER_11]: This is under collaboration between the school, family, and community will increase by so many percentages during the school year.

981
01:27:44,313 --> 01:27:49,395
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, because we have the new school brains and in the teacher's contract, they agreed to

982
01:27:50,586 --> 01:27:53,627
[SPEAKER_11]: Be using that for parent communication, we're getting that up and running.

983
01:27:54,327 --> 01:27:57,587
[SPEAKER_11]: My next report is to report out a little bit on school brains and our progress.

984
01:27:58,068 --> 01:28:00,908
[SPEAKER_11]: But again, increase in the online communication.

985
01:28:01,188 --> 01:28:07,589
[SPEAKER_11]: That language wasn't reflected in the previous year's goals, but we felt it was important to highlight this year.

986
01:28:08,070 --> 01:28:15,051
[SPEAKER_11]: So what you have in your packet is just last year's goals, how well we did meeting those, which overall I think was great.

987
01:28:15,091 --> 01:28:17,371
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess Bernadette wants to address those, she can.

988
01:28:17,892 --> 01:28:18,992
[SPEAKER_11]: And then moving forward,

989
01:28:20,238 --> 01:28:24,979
[SPEAKER_11]: presenting this to the teachers, these goals will go out to the administrators.

990
01:28:25,039 --> 01:28:34,101
[SPEAKER_11]: They can give them to the teachers, and then the teachers can start to formulate their own professional goals and student goals for their own evaluation.

991
01:28:34,141 --> 01:28:41,503
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's kind of the process, and we, again, had to get this out very quickly this month because we have a timeline in the contract.

992
01:28:41,963 --> 01:28:48,065
[SPEAKER_11]: Teachers have to do this by a certain date, this by a certain date, and they need to get their plans and their goals in.

993
01:28:48,636 --> 01:28:50,758
[SPEAKER_11]: within the next couple of weeks I believe is the deadline.

994
01:28:51,458 --> 01:28:54,240
[SPEAKER_11]: So any questions on that or anything you'd like Bernadette to address?

995
01:28:54,581 --> 01:28:54,781
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

996
01:28:54,841 --> 01:28:55,401
[SPEAKER_11]: Van der Kloot.

997
01:28:55,882 --> 01:28:59,124
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say thank you for all the work that this entails.

998
01:28:59,244 --> 01:29:10,333
[SPEAKER_01]: I went through it and saw how much work because it's not only articulating them, it's also making sure that we're planning all of the appropriate activities that go along with them.

999
01:29:11,374 --> 01:29:15,357
[SPEAKER_01]: Does this need a motion of approval to approve the goals?

1000
01:29:17,361 --> 01:29:26,284
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm guessing yes, so I'll make the motion to approve the goals set forth, the district priority educational goals for school year 2016-2017.

1001
01:29:26,324 --> 01:29:27,764
[SPEAKER_01]: Second.

1002
01:29:28,965 --> 01:29:29,905
[SPEAKER_16]: Any other questions?

1003
01:29:30,765 --> 01:29:32,446
[SPEAKER_16]: I have a few questions, if you don't mind.

1004
01:29:32,746 --> 01:29:38,468
[SPEAKER_16]: I compared the goals of what you met, what your goals were for last year and what this year's goals were.

1005
01:29:39,528 --> 01:29:43,549
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm very happy to say you met a tremendous amount of the goals that you set forth.

1006
01:29:43,949 --> 01:29:45,630
[SPEAKER_16]: There is a few areas that

1007
01:29:46,453 --> 01:29:54,756
[SPEAKER_16]: You either didn't meet them as of yet, or you re, you alternated them with other things.

1008
01:29:54,936 --> 01:29:56,696
[SPEAKER_16]: And if something isn't working, it's great.

1009
01:29:56,836 --> 01:30:02,698
[SPEAKER_16]: I was very happy to see that you took that initiative and moved them.

1010
01:30:03,458 --> 01:30:12,061
[SPEAKER_16]: There was one on SMART goal, district priority goal two from last year, number three.

1011
01:30:12,081 --> 01:30:14,842
[SPEAKER_16]: No, not number three, sorry.

1012
01:30:19,107 --> 01:30:22,310
[SPEAKER_16]: Number two, alternative direction for the goal.

1013
01:30:23,571 --> 01:30:33,078
[SPEAKER_16]: You have the minimum of 10% of educators in each school work with central administration in planning and preparing professional development programs for mass social and emotional curriculum.

1014
01:30:33,679 --> 01:30:35,260
[SPEAKER_16]: And you went the alternative direction.

1015
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:40,364
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't see that in the next, this year's goals.

1016
01:30:40,745 --> 01:30:41,786
[SPEAKER_16]: Did I just miss that?

1017
01:30:43,336 --> 01:30:45,958
[SPEAKER_15]: I will address that.

1018
01:30:46,398 --> 01:30:52,562
[SPEAKER_15]: So the alternative route was the direction, we took that direction from what was in the new contract.

1019
01:30:52,602 --> 01:31:02,327
[SPEAKER_15]: So prior to the contract being finalized, we thought we would go with the members from each school, and then we changed it.

1020
01:31:02,888 --> 01:31:08,151
[SPEAKER_15]: So moving forward, I'm going to move forward to goal number two in the new goals.

1021
01:31:09,011 --> 01:31:10,572
[SPEAKER_15]: Perhaps we just implied this.

1022
01:31:16,312 --> 01:31:16,732
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

1023
01:31:17,352 --> 01:31:18,153
[SPEAKER_15]: We did not.

1024
01:31:18,433 --> 01:31:21,734
[SPEAKER_15]: We did not put it in a goal, but that team is functioning.

1025
01:31:22,515 --> 01:31:25,756
[SPEAKER_15]: The team is comprised of six teachers and six administrators.

1026
01:31:26,116 --> 01:31:28,017
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm one of the administrators on that group.

1027
01:31:28,818 --> 01:31:31,779
[SPEAKER_15]: The team is up and running, and we do have a plan.

1028
01:31:32,579 --> 01:31:35,661
[SPEAKER_15]: We've actually met a lot, but we did not.

1029
01:31:35,821 --> 01:31:38,462
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you think that's necessary to be added at that point?

1030
01:31:41,363 --> 01:31:44,745
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we referenced the Professional Development Committee, and it is in the contract.

1031
01:31:45,165 --> 01:31:53,426
[SPEAKER_11]: And as Bernadette said, prior to that being an entity in the contract, we had the language about having participation.

1032
01:31:53,887 --> 01:31:59,228
[SPEAKER_11]: But now it's written in the contract and it's kind of like what we did before is kind of null and void.

1033
01:31:59,588 --> 01:32:04,208
[SPEAKER_11]: Because the contract kind of supersedes what was formally in that language.

1034
01:32:05,009 --> 01:32:09,469
[SPEAKER_11]: We could put in again, I think we did reference the professional development committee.

1035
01:32:09,569 --> 01:32:11,730
[SPEAKER_11]: People are pretty much aware of it.

1036
01:32:11,770 --> 01:32:12,910
[SPEAKER_11]: There are teachers serving.

1037
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:19,543
[SPEAKER_11]: We're actively on that, we're planning our November 8th professional development day with a lot of teacher involvement.

1038
01:32:19,983 --> 01:32:27,406
[SPEAKER_11]: Quite honestly, having a committee is nice, but it adds another layer of work because you have another group that you have to work with.

1039
01:32:28,126 --> 01:32:32,168
[SPEAKER_11]: We're meeting on Thursday, all the administrators and teacher facilitators.

1040
01:32:32,228 --> 01:32:34,029
[SPEAKER_11]: We have quite a group going on.

1041
01:32:34,129 --> 01:32:39,651
[SPEAKER_11]: So the professional development committee has kind of replaced anything else that we had been doing to

1042
01:32:40,359 --> 01:32:43,122
[SPEAKER_11]: solicit teacher involvement in professional development.

1043
01:32:43,442 --> 01:32:46,565
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, that totally equals that.

1044
01:32:48,026 --> 01:33:01,839
[SPEAKER_16]: So on the next page, District Priority Goal 4, Section 3, it's stated by the end of 15-16, the district will have fully developed two common assessments per client and

1045
01:33:05,129 --> 01:33:10,274
[SPEAKER_16]: And it says approach the goal for how we've met.

1046
01:33:10,494 --> 01:33:14,919
[SPEAKER_16]: Common assessments have been developing in most of the areas, the grade level areas.

1047
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:21,186
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're in the process of finalizing assessments for hospital grades.

1048
01:33:22,047 --> 01:33:25,571
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just want to know if those assessments will

1049
01:33:26,050 --> 01:33:32,432
[SPEAKER_16]: judge the programs that we purchased, like the journeys and the math program?

1050
01:33:33,772 --> 01:33:37,954
[SPEAKER_16]: Will it evaluate how far we've come because we purchased them?

1051
01:33:38,014 --> 01:33:39,854
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'd like to see some of that data.

1052
01:33:40,174 --> 01:33:44,476
[SPEAKER_15]: So the intent of the common assessments is to show student growth.

1053
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:48,337
[SPEAKER_15]: So certainly those results for student growth will be available.

1054
01:33:48,737 --> 01:33:50,998
[SPEAKER_15]: The process by which we're going to go through is

1055
01:33:51,858 --> 01:33:58,022
[SPEAKER_15]: is kind of gray right now because we're not sure what the state is going to require in terms of the DDM and its implementation.

1056
01:33:59,863 --> 01:34:08,108
[SPEAKER_15]: So, for example, in any grade that has MCAS, that needs to be used as one of the measures of student impact.

1057
01:34:11,230 --> 01:34:12,110
[SPEAKER_15]: It is possible.

1058
01:34:12,130 --> 01:34:15,012
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm trying to remember some of the assessments.

1059
01:34:15,909 --> 01:34:19,251
[SPEAKER_15]: There are a couple of assessments that are program-based.

1060
01:34:19,291 --> 01:34:20,152
[SPEAKER_15]: They come from Journey.

1061
01:34:20,192 --> 01:34:21,172
[SPEAKER_15]: They come from Envisions.

1062
01:34:21,713 --> 01:34:27,136
[SPEAKER_15]: The intent was not to measure the effectiveness of the program, but rather the effect on student growth.

1063
01:34:27,736 --> 01:34:29,658
[SPEAKER_15]: So I will tell you that that is evolving.

1064
01:34:30,358 --> 01:34:36,982
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, we feel like we're being pulled in different directions with what the state is requiring of the implementation of the DDMs.

1065
01:34:37,402 --> 01:34:39,884
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess that's the closest I can get to an answer to you.

1066
01:34:42,399 --> 01:34:46,000
[SPEAKER_15]: I know it takes about three years, and I know our ELA program that we bought is a little bit more than three years now.

1067
01:34:46,020 --> 01:34:48,581
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would like to know, as a committee member,

1068
01:35:01,422 --> 01:35:06,205
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, the progress and growth we've made because of that purchase and how it's worked out.

1069
01:35:06,325 --> 01:35:06,705
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all.

1070
01:35:06,805 --> 01:35:07,886
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's different from this?

1071
01:35:08,526 --> 01:35:12,948
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I think that such an evaluation of the program needs to occur.

1072
01:35:13,008 --> 01:35:17,551
[SPEAKER_15]: The intent of the common assessments is not to measure the program.

1073
01:35:18,231 --> 01:35:25,035
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think your suggestion, as I'm taking the suggestion, a need that we have is to measure the program is understood.

1074
01:35:25,055 --> 01:35:30,098
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'd like to make a motion at this time that through the superintendent we have a report of

1075
01:35:30,807 --> 01:35:44,113
[SPEAKER_16]: these programs and how well our children, how we're performing either way, with the value of those programs and how it's helped our children throughout that process.

1076
01:35:44,233 --> 01:35:45,094
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what I mean?

1077
01:35:45,114 --> 01:35:50,756
[SPEAKER_11]: If I could just add, the intent of the programs are to better support the curriculum.

1078
01:35:51,197 --> 01:35:54,838
[SPEAKER_11]: Where you're going to see the results would be in the state assessments.

1079
01:35:55,519 --> 01:35:55,879
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1080
01:35:55,899 --> 01:36:00,301
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, now again, within each program there are a lot of assessments that are built in.

1081
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:02,721
[SPEAKER_11]: along the way that teachers are using.

1082
01:36:03,362 --> 01:36:07,905
[SPEAKER_11]: But, I mean, the reason why we put new programs in is to support the curriculum.

1083
01:36:07,945 --> 01:36:09,786
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's where you're going to see the results.

1084
01:36:10,226 --> 01:36:15,450
[SPEAKER_11]: The DDMs, or common assessments, or whatever they're going to be called next week, are a different entity.

1085
01:36:15,750 --> 01:36:15,970
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

1086
01:36:16,310 --> 01:36:24,136
[SPEAKER_16]: So we will get that when we get our results, which are due, which were released at 5 o'clock.

1087
01:36:24,156 --> 01:36:25,677
[SPEAKER_11]: Which I'm going to talk about a little later on.

1088
01:36:26,097 --> 01:36:26,377
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

1089
01:36:26,537 --> 01:36:30,380
[SPEAKER_16]: So moving forward to next year's goals.

1090
01:36:31,422 --> 01:36:32,042
[SPEAKER_16]: I had a few.

1091
01:36:34,624 --> 01:36:37,666
[SPEAKER_16]: So at least you know when you do a report that I actually read it.

1092
01:36:38,067 --> 01:36:39,628
[SPEAKER_16]: I do.

1093
01:36:40,248 --> 01:36:41,669
[SPEAKER_16]: I know we all do.

1094
01:36:42,970 --> 01:36:45,352
[SPEAKER_16]: District four priority goal.

1095
01:36:45,632 --> 01:36:57,020
[SPEAKER_16]: I just thought that there could be another goal on the district's mock goals to increase our citywide level

1096
01:36:58,757 --> 01:37:08,040
[SPEAKER_16]: which I'm hoping we have good news this evening about anyway, in rating, to move to make all schools a level one.

1097
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:10,100
[SPEAKER_16]: Could that be added there?

1098
01:37:11,401 --> 01:37:14,422
[SPEAKER_16]: Like a goal for our community.

1099
01:37:14,682 --> 01:37:16,682
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just thought that that was the right place for that.

1100
01:37:23,204 --> 01:37:25,985
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, remember, the intent of these goals are

1101
01:37:26,539 --> 01:37:29,701
[SPEAKER_11]: to guide teachers in formulating their own goals.

1102
01:37:29,761 --> 01:37:39,265
[SPEAKER_11]: So the only way a teacher could really use that is the teacher would say that he or she is working towards a level one priority.

1103
01:37:40,986 --> 01:37:41,526
[SPEAKER_11]: Too broad?

1104
01:37:46,389 --> 01:37:48,210
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we see in the school

1105
01:37:49,145 --> 01:37:56,847
[SPEAKER_11]: That we want to support the curriculum, we want to make sure that we get continued improvement academically.

1106
01:37:58,248 --> 01:38:02,649
[SPEAKER_11]: Accountability is not necessarily always tied to academics.

1107
01:38:03,169 --> 01:38:06,770
[SPEAKER_11]: As we're going to learn tonight, there are other factors that go into accountability.

1108
01:38:07,170 --> 01:38:14,452
[SPEAKER_11]: So to say as an educational goal that someone is going to work towards making level one, I don't know that one individual person can do that.

1109
01:38:14,872 --> 01:38:17,673
[SPEAKER_11]: And so to link this in and have teachers pull out from it.

1110
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:19,520
[SPEAKER_11]: I think would be a little bit of a stretch.

1111
01:38:19,721 --> 01:38:25,462
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that we all are committed to doing better, whether it's moving from level three to level two to level one.

1112
01:38:25,522 --> 01:38:30,984
[SPEAKER_11]: Level one is obviously the gold standard, that we all would like to be up there.

1113
01:38:31,984 --> 01:38:37,026
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's more than just academic to get there.

1114
01:38:37,406 --> 01:38:43,248
[SPEAKER_16]: Just on the next goal, priority goal five, item three.

1115
01:38:44,775 --> 01:38:48,819
[SPEAKER_16]: There is not a percentage listed as there was in the previous year.

1116
01:38:49,339 --> 01:39:01,948
[SPEAKER_16]: So by June 2017, each school will implement a positive behavior intervention plan to promote learning and respectful interactions as evidenced by a reduction in student suspensions.

1117
01:39:02,489 --> 01:39:04,891
[SPEAKER_16]: Last year's goal had a percentage of 20%.

1118
01:39:06,812 --> 01:39:12,937
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd like to have a goal for people to hit, like a number, so it's quantifiable.

1119
01:39:13,554 --> 01:39:13,774
[SPEAKER_16]: Right?

1120
01:39:14,854 --> 01:39:16,955
[SPEAKER_11]: We start out with SMART goals.

1121
01:39:16,975 --> 01:39:23,557
[SPEAKER_11]: The very meaning of a SMART goal was measurable and numbers were obviously an important requirement.

1122
01:39:24,158 --> 01:39:26,058
[SPEAKER_11]: The state has kind of gotten away from that.

1123
01:39:27,139 --> 01:39:38,983
[SPEAKER_11]: The teacher's union is not too happy with having a teacher quantify something within his or her own goals.

1124
01:39:39,403 --> 01:39:41,244
[SPEAKER_11]: So we kind of didn't put that in there.

1125
01:39:41,264 --> 01:39:42,184
[SPEAKER_11]: We could go back.

1126
01:39:42,926 --> 01:39:44,487
[SPEAKER_11]: and add in a certain percentage.

1127
01:39:45,969 --> 01:39:48,451
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure if that's.

1128
01:39:48,471 --> 01:39:49,712
[SPEAKER_09]: So let me jump in on that one.

1129
01:39:50,312 --> 01:39:51,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Every school has got a different reality.

1130
01:39:52,594 --> 01:39:57,178
[SPEAKER_09]: You would expect more suspensions at the high school and the middle schools than you would typically at the elementary schools.

1131
01:39:57,858 --> 01:39:59,760
[SPEAKER_09]: So it can't really be system wide.

1132
01:40:00,580 --> 01:40:05,084
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really got to be looked at in terms of the specific school.

1133
01:40:05,204 --> 01:40:09,708
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the specific teachers are different than the specific school.

1134
01:40:09,788 --> 01:40:12,490
[SPEAKER_09]: So teachers don't suspend youngsters.

1135
01:40:13,483 --> 01:40:14,663
[SPEAKER_09]: And these are teacher goals.

1136
01:40:14,683 --> 01:40:16,224
[SPEAKER_09]: These are evaluation of teachers.

1137
01:40:16,724 --> 01:40:23,326
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think you're, by putting percentages, we're giving them an unrealistic role to play because they don't really do that.

1138
01:40:23,986 --> 01:40:27,967
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really done through the, through the office in conjunction with them.

1139
01:40:28,007 --> 01:40:29,368
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't have total control of that.

1140
01:40:30,148 --> 01:40:40,931
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think what you're going to see from us coming up next after this is system wide goals would have nothing to do with specifically the teacher goals, but rather what the school system is trying to do.

1141
01:40:41,490 --> 01:40:45,992
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you might find that as a more realistic percentage.

1142
01:40:47,873 --> 01:40:48,173
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1143
01:40:49,033 --> 01:40:55,956
[SPEAKER_16]: I just saw that in the previous year, and I was just curious why we weren't... More of a refinement.

1144
01:40:56,156 --> 01:40:59,977
[SPEAKER_11]: We changed most of the language of that entire one, too.

1145
01:41:00,037 --> 01:41:06,980
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, you know, working with Kathleen and Daglia, we've tried to talk more about positive behavior intervention supports.

1146
01:41:07,558 --> 01:41:15,162
[SPEAKER_11]: versus looking at the negative suspension, what can we do in a positive way that results in reduced suspension.

1147
01:41:15,282 --> 01:41:19,945
[SPEAKER_11]: So we kind of made that goal more holistic and more positive in nature too.

1148
01:41:20,145 --> 01:41:23,667
[SPEAKER_11]: That's we kind of changed the whole nature of that one.

1149
01:41:24,988 --> 01:41:29,250
[SPEAKER_16]: And my last one is district priority six.

1150
01:41:30,231 --> 01:41:37,095
[SPEAKER_16]: Number two, educators deemed unsatisfactory are needing improvement in standards one and or two.

1151
01:41:38,084 --> 01:41:43,008
[SPEAKER_16]: on their formative or summative evaluation will participate in professional development offerings.

1152
01:41:44,289 --> 01:41:46,471
[SPEAKER_16]: Contractually, is that possible?

1153
01:41:46,531 --> 01:41:48,393
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, can we require that?

1154
01:41:48,513 --> 01:41:56,019
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I read from previous, the explanation from previous year that you couldn't do that.

1155
01:41:56,799 --> 01:41:57,420
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we can.

1156
01:41:57,440 --> 01:42:05,907
[SPEAKER_11]: What we did with this goal, too, is that we looked at last year's and we said, gee, the language was only for educators deemed needing improvement.

1157
01:42:06,570 --> 01:42:08,331
[SPEAKER_11]: But they were the ones that are unsatisfactory.

1158
01:42:08,351 --> 01:42:10,712
[SPEAKER_11]: So we really need to expand to that to include them.

1159
01:42:11,172 --> 01:42:18,496
[SPEAKER_11]: So when an educator is in that category, they're usually put on a plan that they do by contract have to follow.

1160
01:42:18,936 --> 01:42:26,700
[SPEAKER_11]: And that plan would include going to other classes and watching behavior be modeled.

1161
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:30,282
[SPEAKER_11]: So yes, you can enforce it if they're on a plan that calls for that.

1162
01:42:31,122 --> 01:42:32,323
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I just add something to that?

1163
01:42:34,876 --> 01:42:43,661
[SPEAKER_15]: The reason why we approached that goal last year, we could not enforce having a teacher who was having trouble in standards one, standards two.

1164
01:42:43,681 --> 01:42:47,983
[SPEAKER_15]: We could not require them to go in another teacher's classroom, a veteran teacher who could model that.

1165
01:42:48,423 --> 01:42:55,887
[SPEAKER_15]: We also could not require that model teacher to make a novice teacher go in.

1166
01:42:56,888 --> 01:43:02,373
[SPEAKER_15]: So, that is what was not contractually, we couldn't contractually require that.

1167
01:43:03,053 --> 01:43:05,815
[SPEAKER_15]: So, for next year's goal, we've broadened it.

1168
01:43:05,935 --> 01:43:10,659
[SPEAKER_15]: So, it includes the observation of model practice, but it also goes beyond that.

1169
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,642
[SPEAKER_15]: It extends into other PD offerings.

1170
01:43:14,242 --> 01:43:16,004
[SPEAKER_15]: So, we can require

1171
01:43:16,672 --> 01:43:31,540
[SPEAKER_15]: people to participate in other PD in best practices, but what we couldn't do, again, is to have them sit in another teacher's classroom, and then even more importantly, have the veteran teacher have another teacher sit in their classroom.

1172
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:41,446
[SPEAKER_15]: We can suggest it, and I will tell you that most people do it, but I think we crossed the line if we're going to require that.

1173
01:43:41,986 --> 01:43:42,206
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1174
01:43:42,506 --> 01:43:43,707
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for the explanations.

1175
01:43:44,607 --> 01:43:46,087
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have to read the whole thing.

1176
01:43:46,667 --> 01:43:48,348
[SPEAKER_16]: I can just kind of summarize

1177
01:44:12,023 --> 01:44:15,164
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, as you know, we're transitioning to school brains.

1178
01:44:16,065 --> 01:44:17,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything new takes time.

1179
01:44:18,366 --> 01:44:20,827
[SPEAKER_11]: And we really want to support our teachers.

1180
01:44:20,887 --> 01:44:23,888
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a very good relationship with the union.

1181
01:44:23,928 --> 01:44:25,308
[SPEAKER_11]: We meet on a monthly basis.

1182
01:44:25,348 --> 01:44:27,129
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a joint labor management committee.

1183
01:44:27,889 --> 01:44:33,732
[SPEAKER_11]: There are several of us sit on that, along with the president of the union and several members of the executive board.

1184
01:44:34,072 --> 01:44:35,713
[SPEAKER_11]: And we work out problems.

1185
01:44:35,933 --> 01:44:38,894
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of the things that came up is that teachers

1186
01:44:39,498 --> 01:44:44,099
[SPEAKER_11]: Although they felt on the first day of school, we gave them training, we gave them training actually in the spring.

1187
01:44:44,700 --> 01:44:47,741
[SPEAKER_11]: But the first day of school, they had their own data, which was really important.

1188
01:44:48,061 --> 01:44:50,381
[SPEAKER_11]: And they began to be able to really use the system.

1189
01:44:50,882 --> 01:44:52,322
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're able to take attendance.

1190
01:44:52,382 --> 01:44:53,582
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything went really well with that.

1191
01:44:53,602 --> 01:44:54,863
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was the most important thing.

1192
01:44:55,283 --> 01:45:00,204
[SPEAKER_11]: School brains, what we have to think about is rolling it out in tiers.

1193
01:45:00,765 --> 01:45:04,666
[SPEAKER_11]: And so the first thing was very important for teachers the first day of school to be able to take attendance.

1194
01:45:05,166 --> 01:45:08,047
[SPEAKER_11]: And they were all able to do that, because we had that training.

1195
01:45:08,469 --> 01:45:10,590
[SPEAKER_11]: before the students came in that first day.

1196
01:45:11,370 --> 01:45:21,214
[SPEAKER_11]: We heard from the union that teachers at the middle and high school level who used grade book were a little less comfortable with that particular aspect of school brains.

1197
01:45:21,254 --> 01:45:22,894
[SPEAKER_11]: And they were looking for more training.

1198
01:45:23,455 --> 01:45:25,855
[SPEAKER_11]: Now last year what we did is we rolled this out.

1199
01:45:25,895 --> 01:45:34,519
[SPEAKER_11]: We decided that one of the best ways to support teachers was to have individual teachers in each building be the support assistants.

1200
01:45:34,599 --> 01:45:36,619
[SPEAKER_11]: So we actually gave them a stipend.

1201
01:45:37,080 --> 01:45:38,020
[SPEAKER_11]: We trained them.

1202
01:45:38,611 --> 01:45:42,553
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're the individuals that would be the first line of support in a building.

1203
01:45:43,374 --> 01:45:45,655
[SPEAKER_11]: Those people too felt they needed more support.

1204
01:45:46,075 --> 01:45:54,140
[SPEAKER_11]: So what we did, we met with the school brains representatives earlier this month, and we worked out a training session.

1205
01:45:54,640 --> 01:46:02,645
[SPEAKER_11]: So what's going to happen Wednesday afternoon is that we are going to have a training session for the building trainers and

1206
01:46:03,322 --> 01:46:09,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Many of our administrators, because we obviously know they have to support this too, on the use of grade book.

1207
01:46:09,504 --> 01:46:12,285
[SPEAKER_11]: And the school brains representatives will be there as well.

1208
01:46:12,825 --> 01:46:19,567
[SPEAKER_11]: That's an early release day for middle and high school, so we're going to have the training during that time.

1209
01:46:20,168 --> 01:46:25,049
[SPEAKER_11]: So now those individuals, hopefully on Wednesday, will be very confident in the use of grade book.

1210
01:46:25,850 --> 01:46:33,032
[SPEAKER_11]: And on October 19th, which is a mandated early release day, as you know with the new contract,

1211
01:46:33,603 --> 01:46:39,285
[SPEAKER_11]: We gained back some of the early release days as mandated days for professional development.

1212
01:46:39,785 --> 01:46:41,726
[SPEAKER_11]: October 19 is one of those.

1213
01:46:42,306 --> 01:46:47,628
[SPEAKER_11]: And what we're having is a school-based, again, middle and high school, because elementary aren't using gradebook.

1214
01:46:48,229 --> 01:47:02,674
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to have the trainers, the school brains people, we're going to have the administrators who have been trained in the buildings with the teachers, and we're going to retrain them on gradebook so that they lead that session

1215
01:47:03,158 --> 01:47:04,799
[SPEAKER_11]: confident to be able to use that.

1216
01:47:05,219 --> 01:47:08,640
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, as we roll this out, we know that there are going to be little snags.

1217
01:47:09,300 --> 01:47:14,782
[SPEAKER_11]: We kind of are dealing with them as they come along and working out ways to get around them.

1218
01:47:15,183 --> 01:47:19,484
[SPEAKER_11]: Paul DeLevis stepped up, put a big part of, taking a big role with this.

1219
01:47:19,544 --> 01:47:22,065
[SPEAKER_11]: He is helping us to organize this training.

1220
01:47:22,105 --> 01:47:25,566
[SPEAKER_11]: He's actually going to help deliver the training on Wednesday.

1221
01:47:26,027 --> 01:47:29,328
[SPEAKER_11]: So we feel that with that training on October 19th,

1222
01:47:30,382 --> 01:47:37,216
[SPEAKER_11]: will be able to get by that segment of school brains and move on to the next phase of the training, whatever that brings.

1223
01:47:37,457 --> 01:47:38,679
[SPEAKER_11]: So, any questions on that?

1224
01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:47,487
[SPEAKER_03]: I know with any software program, especially when it rolls out, there's always going to be glitches.

1225
01:47:47,827 --> 01:47:53,552
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm happy to hear that you have a lot of this in the planning session of it.

1226
01:47:54,052 --> 01:48:04,801
[SPEAKER_03]: What I have heard is, though, I know that what teachers put into the system and what secretaries are putting into the system and what certain administrators are putting into the system is all different.

1227
01:48:05,341 --> 01:48:20,369
[SPEAKER_03]: So even though they have building trainers that they could go to sometimes, especially when it gets really busy, we really can't pull certain teachers out that have, let's say, learned the program to go and help someone at that moment.

1228
01:48:20,509 --> 01:48:28,234
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that I've heard a lot of Mr. DeLaver and actually Mr. Tootin have been helping out tremendously.

1229
01:48:28,814 --> 01:48:31,916
[SPEAKER_03]: But one question that did come up, speaking to a few people,

1230
01:48:32,872 --> 01:48:43,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it possible, maybe, if there's some type of hotline or something that I know myself, where I am, we're rolling out a totally different program, so we're piloting it.

1231
01:48:43,518 --> 01:48:48,900
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess the question is, is there a hotline that you could actually be doing something?

1232
01:48:48,941 --> 01:48:55,424
[SPEAKER_03]: And at that moment, if you have that question, you could actually call someone and say, could you help me through this?

1233
01:48:55,544 --> 01:49:01,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Because sometimes it's difficult, though, to go and grab someone in the building, and you're at a standstill.

1234
01:49:01,729 --> 01:49:03,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you can't get to the next step.

1235
01:49:03,670 --> 01:49:10,872
[SPEAKER_11]: The individuals who are primarily in charge of the school brains are Jean Irwin, Curtis Tootin's assisting her with that.

1236
01:49:11,272 --> 01:49:12,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. DeLave has stepped up.

1237
01:49:12,793 --> 01:49:16,294
[SPEAKER_11]: He's really good with technology, and he understands the system very well.

1238
01:49:17,074 --> 01:49:27,438
[SPEAKER_11]: So if a building trainer was unavailable or unable to answer a question, the next line of communication would be to Jean Irwin or to Curtis Tootin.

1239
01:49:27,478 --> 01:49:28,038
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're there.

1240
01:49:28,058 --> 01:49:31,639
[SPEAKER_11]: The hotline, the school brains people, quite honestly, have been very responsive.

1241
01:49:32,046 --> 01:49:36,787
[SPEAKER_11]: Anytime they've had questions, they're right there because they're local people.

1242
01:49:37,608 --> 01:49:40,048
[SPEAKER_11]: The other thing, too, is that there's lots of tutorials.

1243
01:49:40,509 --> 01:49:43,690
[SPEAKER_11]: School Brains doesn't just do these live trainings and that's it.

1244
01:49:45,030 --> 01:49:49,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Teachers can review trainings, but they've got to access them.

1245
01:49:49,111 --> 01:49:50,392
[SPEAKER_11]: They're up there, they're available.

1246
01:49:50,752 --> 01:49:57,894
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are some of the topics we identified as issues with the School Brains representatives who came out and met us a couple of weeks ago.

1247
01:49:58,601 --> 01:50:09,725
[SPEAKER_11]: There are different layers of support, so answers should be able to come either from the building person, and I understand they may not always be available, but through Jean, Curtis, and the School Brains people.

1248
01:50:10,145 --> 01:50:17,508
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's this other program that you're saying that you could actually go into the School Brains system and actually look up the question that you might be having.

1249
01:50:17,528 --> 01:50:22,789
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, there are tutorials, so that there'd be a way a person, let's say the person has a training on gradebook.

1250
01:50:22,829 --> 01:50:27,271
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that sometimes, you know, you see something, you might be

1251
01:50:27,792 --> 01:50:30,313
[SPEAKER_11]: paying attention sometimes, but you maybe missed something.

1252
01:50:31,054 --> 01:50:34,215
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a place you can go online and get that instruction, review it.

1253
01:50:34,556 --> 01:50:38,838
[SPEAKER_11]: So there are ways that you just don't have to make sure you get everything in one session.

1254
01:50:39,378 --> 01:50:40,579
[SPEAKER_11]: You can review it online.

1255
01:50:42,480 --> 01:50:44,981
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question.

1256
01:50:45,622 --> 01:50:56,568
[SPEAKER_04]: I was at the curriculum night last week, and Dr. Riccio and Dr. Perla mentioned that they're going to be giving the parents their IDs and

1257
01:50:57,745 --> 01:51:01,026
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I guess passwords, the same night as the open house.

1258
01:51:01,687 --> 01:51:18,113
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of parents, you know, the night of the curriculum night mentioned that they wanted to have, you know, the school brains maybe on a different night, because there would be too much going on the same night as the open house, and it can be a little busy.

1259
01:51:18,613 --> 01:51:21,514
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted to, you know, mention that.

1260
01:51:22,094 --> 01:51:26,556
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's gonna be plans to have maybe a couple different sessions for parents,

1261
01:51:27,060 --> 01:51:35,343
[SPEAKER_04]: who might need help or have questions when it's rolled out to the parents, because I don't think it's rolled out for parents right now.

1262
01:51:35,723 --> 01:51:36,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that right?

1263
01:51:36,443 --> 01:51:39,024
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's another segment of it.

1264
01:51:39,124 --> 01:51:45,666
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that we have a meeting with our administrators, our regular meetings next Tuesday.

1265
01:51:46,667 --> 01:51:56,170
[SPEAKER_11]: I think each principal will develop his or her own schedule for that, but we will address it with the group and make sure that parents are supported

1266
01:51:56,658 --> 01:51:59,601
[SPEAKER_11]: by having the time and the meeting time at school to do that.

1267
01:52:00,062 --> 01:52:05,648
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we need to have Gene and Curtis and even a school brains person to be there, we'll arrange for that.

1268
01:52:07,482 --> 01:52:08,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thanks.

1269
01:52:08,243 --> 01:52:11,605
[SPEAKER_04]: I just didn't know if there'd be enough time for everybody to do the open house.

1270
01:52:11,625 --> 01:52:13,626
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not aware of the schedule, quite honestly.

1271
01:52:13,646 --> 01:52:14,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, yeah.

1272
01:52:15,568 --> 01:52:17,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we'll look forward to hearing about it, thanks.

1273
01:52:17,769 --> 01:52:22,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, I did forget about Jean Irwin, so I don't want you thinking that I didn't hear good things about her.

1274
01:52:22,533 --> 01:52:24,915
[SPEAKER_03]: I did know that there were the three of them, I just forgot about her.

1275
01:52:25,195 --> 01:52:25,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1276
01:52:28,697 --> 01:52:33,000
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion on the floor to accept, report accepted and placed on file.

1277
01:52:33,020 --> 01:52:34,061
[SPEAKER_16]: So moved.

1278
01:52:39,675 --> 01:52:41,956
[SPEAKER_16]: Everybody who agrees say aye.

1279
01:52:42,317 --> 01:52:42,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1280
01:52:43,357 --> 01:52:44,318
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1281
01:52:44,458 --> 01:52:46,179
[SPEAKER_16]: Report on Minuteman project.

1282
01:52:48,620 --> 01:52:52,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam Chairperson, members of the committee, just an update on what's going on in Minuteman.

1283
01:52:53,723 --> 01:52:58,205
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a district-wide vote among the Minuteman communities.

1284
01:52:58,265 --> 01:53:00,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Sixteen communities voted on September 20th.

1285
01:53:03,570 --> 01:53:07,271
[SPEAKER_09]: 10% of the population in those 16 communities came out to vote.

1286
01:53:07,311 --> 01:53:10,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Some communities only had 2% and some communities are withdrawing.

1287
01:53:10,712 --> 01:53:13,153
[SPEAKER_09]: There were 16 communities in Minuteman.

1288
01:53:14,113 --> 01:53:21,075
[SPEAKER_09]: It's down to 10 now and by the end of this year and then Belmont looks like it will withdraw so it'll bring it down to 9.

1289
01:53:23,316 --> 01:53:27,217
[SPEAKER_09]: This gives you an idea of what's going on but they will get to build their building

1290
01:53:27,727 --> 01:53:31,989
[SPEAKER_09]: But they'll build it for a number that I don't believe they're going to fulfill.

1291
01:53:32,709 --> 01:53:41,133
[SPEAKER_09]: The one thing I want to bring to your attention is that our population is decreasing at Minutemen, and I think within two years we'll have no one there.

1292
01:53:41,953 --> 01:53:53,959
[SPEAKER_09]: But should we have someone there, one of the provisions of the new regulations called for a capital fee, which we feel is an unfunded mandate, and we will contest with many of the communities that are on this back sheet.

1293
01:53:55,079 --> 01:54:00,504
[SPEAKER_09]: But the commissioner has put it out and it gives you an idea of how many communities are involved.

1294
01:54:00,524 --> 01:54:06,528
[SPEAKER_09]: There's like 34 outside of the district communities, most of whom will object to that fee.

1295
01:54:07,229 --> 01:54:09,871
[SPEAKER_09]: We think that they've underestimated the actual cost.

1296
01:54:10,011 --> 01:54:15,415
[SPEAKER_09]: We think that Minuteman could cost a place like Arlington, Newham, $30,000 to $40,000 per student.

1297
01:54:16,516 --> 01:54:19,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Going forward, I think it's absurd, but it is what it is.

1298
01:54:19,899 --> 01:54:22,001
[SPEAKER_09]: And we think we'll be out of it, but I want to keep you

1299
01:54:22,821 --> 01:54:44,274
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want you to know that we will, with other communities that are out of district, be initiating appropriate legal action through the Division of Local Mandates and then, if necessary, through the courts to avoid any kind of possibility that a capital fee could actually come home to roost at some point should an individual

1300
01:54:44,983 --> 01:54:46,704
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we don't believe that's appropriate.

1301
01:54:47,444 --> 01:54:48,784
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have equity in the project.

1302
01:54:49,164 --> 01:54:50,865
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't believe the number is appropriate.

1303
01:54:51,325 --> 01:54:53,326
[SPEAKER_09]: And we believe that it's an overbuilt school.

1304
01:54:53,786 --> 01:54:56,527
[SPEAKER_09]: But nevertheless, this is what in place to keep you posted.

1305
01:54:57,067 --> 01:54:59,468
[SPEAKER_09]: We think our vocational school is doing extremely well.

1306
01:54:59,968 --> 01:55:10,872
[SPEAKER_09]: And we think that in a couple of years, we won't have anyone going anywhere outside of our own school, except for possibly an agricultural school, which is beyond us unless you're prepared to buy a cow and a horse.

1307
01:55:11,813 --> 01:55:12,653
[SPEAKER_09]: If you are, let me know.

1308
01:55:13,877 --> 01:55:15,958
[SPEAKER_09]: We can look at that, but I don't think that's a good idea.

1309
01:55:15,998 --> 01:55:16,078
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay?

1310
01:55:18,339 --> 01:55:18,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Any questions?

1311
01:55:18,719 --> 01:55:19,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Report placed on file.

1312
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:24,502
[SPEAKER_16]: Report accepted and placed on file.

1313
01:55:24,662 --> 01:55:26,083
[SPEAKER_16]: All those that approve, say aye.

1314
01:55:26,103 --> 01:55:26,703
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1315
01:55:26,943 --> 01:55:27,803
[SPEAKER_16]: All those against?

1316
01:55:28,564 --> 01:55:29,324
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to delete.

1317
01:55:30,385 --> 01:55:35,107
[SPEAKER_16]: Next item, financial records, FY16, current year FY17.

1318
01:55:35,267 --> 01:55:42,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam Chairperson, making her final appearance before the Methodist School Committee.

1319
01:55:47,129 --> 01:55:47,630
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

1320
01:55:49,053 --> 01:55:51,999
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll start with FY16's wrap-up year-end summary.

1321
01:55:52,019 --> 01:55:55,186
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll find attached the financial report

1322
01:55:56,293 --> 01:56:02,516
[SPEAKER_14]: the final summary for the GL for the period of July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016.

1323
01:56:03,417 --> 01:56:10,121
[SPEAKER_14]: We completed the fiscal year as planned and in the year carrying $100,145 in encumbrances.

1324
01:56:10,761 --> 01:56:13,843
[SPEAKER_14]: These are expenses for which we did not have an invoice at closing.

1325
01:56:14,303 --> 01:56:17,185
[SPEAKER_14]: However, the expenses are attributable to the FY 16 year.

1326
01:56:18,781 --> 01:56:21,804
[SPEAKER_14]: Utility usage reports are attached, as you can see.

1327
01:56:22,444 --> 01:56:36,177
[SPEAKER_14]: We did end the year at about 4% over last year in electricity cost, and we did end the year under on the natural gas as we planned by almost 24%, which was indicative of the nice, warm winter we had.

1328
01:56:37,077 --> 01:56:38,218
[SPEAKER_14]: Can't guarantee that this year.

1329
01:56:40,496 --> 01:56:50,699
[SPEAKER_14]: The budget includes a city appropriation of $52,933,000, and 1.7 planned revenue was expended as follows, $52,933,000 general fund expenditures plus 1.5 for planned FY16 general fund expenditures, as well as $238,000 offset entry to school revolving accounts.

1330
01:56:50,719 --> 01:56:53,781
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll also find attached to your reports the year to year comparison budget versus actuals.

1331
01:57:12,038 --> 01:57:13,158
[SPEAKER_14]: Any questions on FY16?

1332
01:57:13,419 --> 01:57:15,839
[SPEAKER_14]: Any questions?

1333
01:57:16,480 --> 01:57:18,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have to give any money back to the city?

1334
01:57:18,561 --> 01:57:18,741
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

1335
01:57:20,821 --> 01:57:23,462
[SPEAKER_16]: I did have one quick question, or one quick note.

1336
01:57:23,723 --> 01:57:36,768
[SPEAKER_16]: I noticed at the end of the fiscal year 2016 that there were three areas in the budget that were more than 10% over their initial budget plan.

1337
01:57:36,888 --> 01:57:40,309
[SPEAKER_16]: And those areas were the high school, the middle school, and security.

1338
01:57:40,907 --> 01:57:46,408
[SPEAKER_16]: My request is that we keep an eye on these for this year and make sure that they stay within their budget parameters.

1339
01:57:47,068 --> 01:57:48,368
[SPEAKER_16]: Over to the superintendent.

1340
01:57:49,008 --> 01:58:01,151
[SPEAKER_09]: So one of the things you need to remember is that in this report, the way it's set up, the distribution of undistributed due to contract negotiations was moved after the fact.

1341
01:58:01,771 --> 01:58:04,451
[SPEAKER_09]: So that when that gets moved, they're not over the top.

1342
01:58:04,471 --> 01:58:08,472
[SPEAKER_09]: They just simply reflect that contract negotiations took place.

1343
01:58:09,110 --> 01:58:11,631
[SPEAKER_09]: and that those contributions went over there.

1344
01:58:12,151 --> 01:58:13,452
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's just the way it is.

1345
01:58:13,772 --> 01:58:21,555
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the way we report it so you see it in totality in the raw score rather than move the money around and then to just balance it out.

1346
01:58:22,235 --> 01:58:23,575
[SPEAKER_09]: So we just show it to you the way it is.

1347
01:58:23,635 --> 01:58:29,858
[SPEAKER_09]: But in a non-negotiated year, in a year where we're not negotiating a contract, those numbers have already been worked in.

1348
01:58:30,358 --> 01:58:34,640
[SPEAKER_09]: So you won't see that this year, but you might see it in another negotiated year.

1349
01:58:37,561 --> 01:58:39,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Set the report, place on file, Madam Chairman.

1350
01:58:40,162 --> 01:58:42,263
[SPEAKER_16]: Those who accept say aye.

1351
01:58:42,563 --> 01:58:42,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1352
01:58:43,104 --> 01:58:44,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Could I just ask one question?

1353
01:58:44,824 --> 01:58:45,345
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1354
01:58:45,365 --> 01:58:47,045
[SPEAKER_04]: I almost missed it.

1355
01:58:47,066 --> 01:58:47,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1356
01:58:48,206 --> 01:58:49,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Pat, I want to thank you for the report.

1357
01:58:50,027 --> 01:58:56,550
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just wanted to ask just a couple of questions for the upcoming school year, you know, in terms of the transportation.

1358
01:58:56,570 --> 01:59:07,175
[SPEAKER_04]: I know last year there was a planned field trip between the elementary school and the high school, and I almost missed the opportunity

1359
01:59:07,632 --> 01:59:11,695
[SPEAKER_04]: to ask for the funding, so I wanted to mention it now.

1360
01:59:11,715 --> 01:59:17,760
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's a good time, but I wanted to mention that I did talk to Ms.

1361
01:59:17,800 --> 01:59:25,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Lasky, and she was interested in doing another field trip between the elementary school and the vocational school, like the biotech.

1362
01:59:25,605 --> 01:59:27,887
[SPEAKER_04]: She's going to be having another aquaponics.

1363
01:59:29,570 --> 01:59:39,978
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to mention, I don't know if it's something that I should put on the agenda, because it would be something that we would be doing in the spring, you know, once they're all set with their program.

1364
01:59:40,439 --> 01:59:47,565
[SPEAKER_09]: So that would be more appropriate for the current fiscal year, as opposed to the one that we just passed, because that year's over.

1365
01:59:47,585 --> 01:59:52,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Now we're looking at this year's report to date, and if you want to make a recommendation.

1366
01:59:53,252 --> 01:59:55,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so that's what I'll probably do.

1367
01:59:55,413 --> 01:59:56,753
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll just accept 2016.

1368
01:59:56,793 --> 01:59:57,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.

1369
01:59:57,974 --> 02:00:12,558
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor of accepting the recommendation in our file, we can move on to the next agenda item, which is the current year 2017, and we'll start with Mrs. Kreatz's request.

1370
02:00:13,719 --> 02:00:23,102
[SPEAKER_04]: I also wanted to mention that I wanted to make sure that it was extended to all the elementary schools who wanted to plan a field trip,

1371
02:00:23,867 --> 02:00:38,010
[SPEAKER_04]: The ideal grade seemed to be like the fourth grade or fifth grade level, because they could understand and they were doing the science program very similar to the vocational biotech and engineering.

1372
02:00:38,731 --> 02:00:40,971
[SPEAKER_04]: And they also went for a walk in the fells.

1373
02:00:41,271 --> 02:00:44,792
[SPEAKER_04]: So they were old enough to understand in the same type of science program.

1374
02:00:45,772 --> 02:00:48,513
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to make that mention.

1375
02:00:48,533 --> 02:00:52,714
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't heard from other elementary schools, but I think it was a great, great

1376
02:00:53,470 --> 02:00:54,811
[SPEAKER_04]: day and it was just wonderful.

1377
02:00:54,911 --> 02:00:59,133
[SPEAKER_04]: I loved it and, you know, I don't want to forget and miss the opportunity so I wanted to mention it.

1378
02:01:01,394 --> 02:01:02,155
[SPEAKER_04]: And, yep.

1379
02:01:02,795 --> 02:01:04,176
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Superintendent, would you like to?

1380
02:01:04,196 --> 02:01:06,877
[SPEAKER_09]: So why don't we take that under advisement and see how we can do it, okay?

1381
02:01:06,917 --> 02:01:07,737
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll get right back to you.

1382
02:01:07,998 --> 02:01:08,518
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, thank you.

1383
02:01:08,558 --> 02:01:22,065
[SPEAKER_16]: A motion on the floor to have the superintendent provide a report to the committee as to whether or not we can provide the elementary school children transportation for a field trip to our high school building.

1384
02:01:24,913 --> 02:01:26,234
[SPEAKER_16]: by Mrs. Kreatz, anyone?

1385
02:01:26,474 --> 02:01:26,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

1386
02:01:27,335 --> 02:01:29,236
[SPEAKER_16]: Second by Mr. Skerry.

1387
02:01:29,316 --> 02:01:30,297
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to approve?

1388
02:01:30,317 --> 02:01:31,477
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1389
02:01:31,758 --> 02:01:31,898
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1390
02:01:32,118 --> 02:01:33,939
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1391
02:01:34,559 --> 02:01:35,340
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion approved.

1392
02:01:35,360 --> 02:01:36,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

1393
02:01:37,041 --> 02:01:39,162
[SPEAKER_04]: I have one more question that's different.

1394
02:01:39,823 --> 02:01:44,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it has to do with the, and I know Pat, you helped answer the question.

1395
02:01:44,286 --> 02:01:47,128
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to do with the MBTA, the S pass.

1396
02:01:47,828 --> 02:01:50,510
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, I didn't know if there was,

1397
02:01:51,567 --> 02:02:02,493
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, if, you know, do, do we previously, you know, provide the middle schools with the S pass, like the MBTA S pass for students, um, at the discounted rate?

1398
02:02:02,953 --> 02:02:12,138
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I reached out to my niece who was, you know, when she was at Arlington, um, in her middle school, she got the, you know, the, the discounted student pass.

1399
02:02:12,158 --> 02:02:15,500
[SPEAKER_04]: So I didn't know it was something that, you know, we did or we didn't do.

1400
02:02:15,600 --> 02:02:19,302
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe some people are using it, you know, in addition to the high school.

1401
02:02:19,582 --> 02:02:21,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I knew we had the parent who was,

1402
02:02:21,687 --> 02:02:24,929
[SPEAKER_04]: asking, you know, if we did provide those passes.

1403
02:02:25,310 --> 02:02:32,075
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just didn't know where that stood and if it was something that we were going to explore, you know, getting those S passes for the students.

1404
02:02:32,715 --> 02:02:45,204
[SPEAKER_04]: I did, you know, check around with the MBTA and it is something that would have to go through the school system, not necessarily the MBTA, but it would be something that would be managed between the school system.

1405
02:02:45,800 --> 02:02:47,802
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, to get those passes.

1406
02:02:48,082 --> 02:03:02,656
[SPEAKER_04]: So I didn't know if it was something that we were going to pursue or maybe do like a survey to find out how many middle school parents would be interested in getting the pass, you know, to see if it was worthwhile to put forward for the next school year.

1407
02:03:02,676 --> 02:03:05,238
[SPEAKER_16]: We have received emails.

1408
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:09,703
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, and as I responded to both of your, all of your emails, I had several people.

1409
02:03:09,723 --> 02:03:10,764
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, yeah, go ahead.

1410
02:03:10,784 --> 02:03:18,310
[SPEAKER_14]: We sell between 300 and 400 bus passes a month for the high school students to transport outside of the Heights area.

1411
02:03:18,330 --> 02:03:22,974
[SPEAKER_14]: And we charge $30 a month for those passes, of which we do not see any money.

1412
02:03:23,474 --> 02:03:24,155
[SPEAKER_14]: We keep nothing.

1413
02:03:24,588 --> 02:03:25,908
[SPEAKER_14]: It all goes back to MBTA.

1414
02:03:26,529 --> 02:03:30,230
[SPEAKER_14]: A few years ago, we did do the middle school passes is my understanding.

1415
02:03:30,850 --> 02:03:32,930
[SPEAKER_14]: We are taking it under consideration.

1416
02:03:33,491 --> 02:03:34,591
[SPEAKER_14]: The need is very small.

1417
02:03:34,951 --> 02:03:38,952
[SPEAKER_14]: I've literally had a handful of people ask for them only in the last two weeks.

1418
02:03:38,972 --> 02:03:43,273
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're looking into whether or not we can do that and what it requires from us.

1419
02:03:43,713 --> 02:03:46,514
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't have specialized MBTA equipment.

1420
02:03:46,954 --> 02:03:49,335
[SPEAKER_14]: We do it all through our own computers and internet.

1421
02:03:49,899 --> 02:03:53,480
[SPEAKER_14]: So it can be a little cumbersome because we're not using a Charlie card machine.

1422
02:03:54,260 --> 02:03:58,682
[SPEAKER_14]: So we are looking into it and we should be able to get back to you in the next few days with a decision.

1423
02:03:58,962 --> 02:03:59,322
[SPEAKER_16]: Perfect.

1424
02:03:59,362 --> 02:03:59,842
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1425
02:04:00,762 --> 02:04:03,123
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's a motion on the floor placed by Ms.

1426
02:04:03,223 --> 02:04:14,026
[SPEAKER_16]: Kreatz for a report from the superintendent as to a follow up as to whether we can provide S passes to our middle school and any students attending method public schools.

1427
02:04:14,747 --> 02:04:15,527
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor.

1428
02:04:15,827 --> 02:04:15,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1429
02:04:16,742 --> 02:04:17,802
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had a question about it.

1430
02:04:18,183 --> 02:04:18,463
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1431
02:04:19,103 --> 02:04:22,665
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question was, I guess I didn't really understand one thing about the yes pass.

1432
02:04:23,125 --> 02:04:34,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the kids, um, can they get the physical pass and loaded at an MBTA station or do they, do we have to, do they have to bring us the money to load?

1433
02:04:35,491 --> 02:04:38,272
[SPEAKER_14]: No, but they do have to be tracked and monitored by us.

1434
02:04:39,052 --> 02:04:40,753
[SPEAKER_14]: So if they come and check out a card

1435
02:04:41,403 --> 02:04:47,969
[SPEAKER_14]: And if they lose the card, we are the person responsible for reactivating a new card and putting a stop on the old card.

1436
02:04:48,329 --> 02:04:55,935
[SPEAKER_14]: So if the card has any money at all left on it, and they come in and say it's lost, then we have to do the actual tracking, stopping, reinitiating.

1437
02:04:56,256 --> 02:04:57,597
[SPEAKER_14]: So it is a cumbersome task.

1438
02:04:58,157 --> 02:04:58,958
[SPEAKER_14]: And I have to tell you,

1439
02:04:59,382 --> 02:05:01,323
[SPEAKER_14]: that our ratio of lost cards is quite high.

1440
02:05:03,525 --> 02:05:04,426
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the population.

1441
02:05:06,127 --> 02:05:06,387
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

1442
02:05:06,908 --> 02:05:11,431
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's a motion on the board, seconded by Mr. Skerry.

1443
02:05:11,571 --> 02:05:12,832
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor, say aye.

1444
02:05:13,172 --> 02:05:13,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1445
02:05:14,073 --> 02:05:14,733
[SPEAKER_16]: All those against?

1446
02:05:15,354 --> 02:05:16,255
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion passes.

1447
02:05:17,856 --> 02:05:20,077
[SPEAKER_16]: Current fiscal year 2017 report.

1448
02:05:21,358 --> 02:05:24,160
[SPEAKER_14]: Attached, you'll find the summary financial report as of September 21.

[SPEAKER_14]: 10-month biweekly employees have received two checks since August 29.

1450
02:05:29,473 --> 02:05:40,181
[SPEAKER_14]: While our 12-month employees have received six paychecks since July 1, most hiring has been completed and new employees have finalized paperwork with the requisite Cori check and request for fingerprinting.

1451
02:05:41,061 --> 02:05:48,046
[SPEAKER_14]: Homeless, currently NPS provides educational programming to 18 homeless students, of which nine require transport.

1452
02:05:48,547 --> 02:05:51,229
[SPEAKER_14]: All students requiring transport have these services in place.

1453
02:05:52,827 --> 02:06:00,354
[SPEAKER_14]: Online payments, the district continues the online payment system and this year has added the after school group to the FACS online payment system.

1454
02:06:01,055 --> 02:06:06,420
[SPEAKER_14]: FACS provides families with the ease of their annual tuition divided by 10 equal monthly payments.

1455
02:06:07,321 --> 02:06:11,485
[SPEAKER_14]: E-Community and MCC product handles fee-based programming online payments.

1456
02:06:12,626 --> 02:06:13,527
[SPEAKER_14]: Special education.

1457

[SPEAKER_14]: Contracts and purchase orders are in process for all approved programming.

1458
02:06:18,156 --> 02:06:26,899
[SPEAKER_14]: FY 17 budget is initially established as $1.2 million general fund, $1 million IDEA grant funding, and the balanced circuit breaker.

1459
02:06:27,519 --> 02:06:32,161
[SPEAKER_14]: Additional encumbrance details provided at the close of the first quarter, which is right around the corner.

1460
02:06:33,481 --> 02:06:36,422
[SPEAKER_14]: Telephones, the VoIP system is established for the district.

1461
02:06:36,742 --> 02:06:41,044
[SPEAKER_14]: Internal changes due to room moves and name changes are handled internally.

1462
02:06:41,464 --> 02:06:43,365
[SPEAKER_14]: And to date, all changes have been completed.

1463
02:06:44,843 --> 02:06:45,683
[SPEAKER_14]: Transportation.

1464
02:06:46,284 --> 02:06:48,944
[SPEAKER_14]: MPS utilizes 18 buses running 2 a.m.

1465

[SPEAKER_14]: routes and 2 p.m.

1469
02:06:59,208 --> 02:07:01,309
[SPEAKER_14]: Routes have been reviewed for use and overcrowding.

1470
02:07:01,329 --> 02:07:02,889
[SPEAKER_14]: We have made a few adjustments.

1471
02:07:03,730 --> 02:07:09,712
[SPEAKER_14]: MPS, K-8 Buildings, and Eastern Bus Company are in the process of completing a manual student count.

1472
02:07:10,232 --> 02:07:13,233
[SPEAKER_14]: That information will be used to update our Transfinder system

1473
02:07:13,717 --> 02:07:17,018
[SPEAKER_14]: and provide us with the emergency list that we are really looking forward to.

1474
02:07:17,038 --> 02:07:27,703
[SPEAKER_14]: I would also like to add that in response to the mayor's earlier report on the updated crossings, we added a stop to the route where the Brooks route goes by a high in Alston.

1475
02:07:28,643 --> 02:07:31,544
[SPEAKER_14]: And we've made it so it's all right side pickup along that stretch.

1476
02:07:31,785 --> 02:07:32,465
[SPEAKER_14]: That's great.

1477
02:07:33,700 --> 02:07:38,364
[SPEAKER_14]: Utilities, the initial three months of the FY17 budget year have been uneventful for utilities.

[SPEAKER_14]: As in the past, all buildings within the district will be monitored and updates provided on a quarterly basis.

1482
02:08:00,950 --> 02:08:03,785
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like to thank all of you for the opportunity to serve Medford.

1483
02:08:05,277 --> 02:08:05,617
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1484
02:08:05,757 --> 02:08:06,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Pat.

1485
02:08:06,877 --> 02:08:07,217
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1486
02:08:07,597 --> 02:08:08,258
[SPEAKER_16]: Any questions?

1487
02:08:08,658 --> 02:08:09,538
[SPEAKER_01]: Motion of approval.

1488
02:08:10,058 --> 02:08:10,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Second.

1489
02:08:10,778 --> 02:08:12,938
[SPEAKER_16]: I do have one question, one comment.

1490
02:08:13,359 --> 02:08:18,720
[SPEAKER_16]: Homeless transportation increased $50,000 in our budget for this year.

1491
02:08:18,880 --> 02:08:22,480
[SPEAKER_16]: It's telling of the times that our families are going through.

1492
02:08:22,500 --> 02:08:27,341
[SPEAKER_16]: I did speak with Representative Christine Barber about this yesterday.

1493
02:08:27,901 --> 02:08:31,622
[SPEAKER_16]: There was an amendment in the state budget to set up a committee

1494
02:08:32,362 --> 02:08:41,928
[SPEAKER_16]: to track transportation and how we're paying for it as a commonwealth, and I am hoping to be placed onto that committee.

1495
02:08:41,948 --> 02:08:43,349
[SPEAKER_16]: It hasn't been decided as of yet.

1496
02:08:44,910 --> 02:09:01,480
[SPEAKER_16]: It's an increase in costs, and we have more and more homeless children in our districts, and I know how difficult it is to get rides for all of our children, and I want to personally thank you for the work that you've done to make sure all our students have a ride to school, and all the effort that you've put in

1497
02:09:02,792 --> 02:09:08,177
[SPEAKER_16]: In transportation, especially, because I know it's not generally something you would assume is your job.

1498
02:09:08,857 --> 02:09:18,226
[SPEAKER_16]: And thank you for all your years of service and all the tremendous change you made in automating our school district and making things more easily understandable.

1499
02:09:18,787 --> 02:09:27,015
[SPEAKER_16]: And specifically, personally, teaching me how to read some of these papers and things, so I don't follow the superintendent oh so much.

1500
02:09:28,132 --> 02:09:30,353
[SPEAKER_09]: So, that's my only- You actually taught her how to read this stuff?

1501
02:09:31,034 --> 02:09:33,175
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1502
02:09:33,195 --> 02:09:34,736
[SPEAKER_16]: Damn.

1503
02:09:34,776 --> 02:09:38,158
[SPEAKER_16]: So, now I figured out a few of my questions before I come here.

1504
02:09:38,178 --> 02:09:42,821
[SPEAKER_16]: So, there's a little less stickies, but that's my only comment on tonight.

1505
02:09:42,901 --> 02:09:46,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Christine, don't make that mistake again.

1506
02:09:46,423 --> 02:09:47,223
[SPEAKER_16]: And thank you again.

1507
02:09:47,243 --> 02:09:47,924
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Pat.

1508
02:09:47,944 --> 02:09:48,384
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Pat.

1509
02:09:48,644 --> 02:09:54,548
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion is on the floor to accept and place the file on, to accept and place the file.

1510
02:09:55,507 --> 02:09:56,608
[SPEAKER_16]: And all in favor?

1511
02:09:56,948 --> 02:09:57,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

1512
02:09:57,428 --> 02:09:57,949
[SPEAKER_16]: All against?

1513
02:09:59,710 --> 02:10:00,450
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion passed.

1514
02:10:02,591 --> 02:10:04,032
[SPEAKER_16]: Negotiations and legal.

1515
02:10:04,252 --> 02:10:05,193
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, no, I'm jumping.

1516
02:10:05,553 --> 02:10:11,777
[SPEAKER_16]: Report on 2016 MCAS Park test results and school accountability ratings.

1517
02:10:11,797 --> 02:10:14,719
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to call on our deputy superintendent to deliver this report.

1518
02:10:17,520 --> 02:10:18,181
[SPEAKER_11]: Good or bad?

1519
02:10:19,842 --> 02:10:21,262
[SPEAKER_11]: Hot off the presses, OK?

1520
02:10:21,323 --> 02:10:23,764
[SPEAKER_11]: We just, you don't have these, so don't look for these in your package yet.

1521
02:10:35,609 --> 02:10:42,015
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I think good is the overall word as we start to analyze all of this.

1522
02:10:42,795 --> 02:10:49,361
[SPEAKER_11]: The information you have we couldn't give to you earlier because actually we just received it Thursday.

1523
02:10:49,861 --> 02:10:51,823
[SPEAKER_11]: We had access to our scores.

1524
02:10:53,506 --> 02:10:59,970
[SPEAKER_11]: on Thursday, and again, we started to analyze things as quickly as we could get things prepared.

1525
02:11:00,610 --> 02:11:06,994
[SPEAKER_11]: All of this was embargoed until 5 o'clock this afternoon, so this is why we can share it openly with you right now.

1526
02:11:07,814 --> 02:11:14,698
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the first of what we anticipate to be several reports that we are going to give to the committee.

1527
02:11:14,898 --> 02:11:22,263
[SPEAKER_11]: As you know, there are a lot of different layers of analysis dealing with the state testing, so we will, again, present

1528
02:11:23,190 --> 02:11:32,612
[SPEAKER_11]: What we have in terms of preliminary information in this report that we prepared for you with Carolyn Joy, Nicole Chiesa, and Rocco Sieri.

1529
02:11:34,252 --> 02:11:44,974
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, as you probably know, MCAS this past year was administered to just 10th graders in Medford in English and mathematics.

1530
02:11:45,774 --> 02:11:49,094
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was the test, the only option for science.

1531
02:11:50,035 --> 02:11:52,795
[SPEAKER_11]: The science MCAS exam is very different.

1532
02:11:53,245 --> 02:11:54,586
[SPEAKER_11]: than the English and Mathematics.

1533
02:11:55,066 --> 02:11:58,229
[SPEAKER_11]: The English and Mathematics MCAS is administered in grade 10.

1534
02:11:58,930 --> 02:12:07,957
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of a test that's a cumulative test of what students have learned through the years up through grade 10, where the science high school test is different.

1535
02:12:08,477 --> 02:12:15,683
[SPEAKER_11]: The science high school test a youngster takes after they complete a specific science course.

1536
02:12:16,304 --> 02:12:22,869
[SPEAKER_11]: So what we try to encourage is that our ninth graders, most of whom take introductory physics,

1537
02:12:23,497 --> 02:12:26,918
[SPEAKER_11]: take the science MCAS introductory physics.

1538
02:12:27,458 --> 02:12:38,100
[SPEAKER_11]: However, if a student doesn't take that, they could take the biology when they take the biology course, or they can take chemistry when they take the chemistry course.

1539
02:12:38,140 --> 02:12:44,001
[SPEAKER_11]: So science MCAS is a little bit different, and it's been that way since its inception.

1540
02:12:45,061 --> 02:12:52,263
[SPEAKER_11]: As you also know, we opted last year, we had a choice for the rest of the school district whether to take MCAS

1541
02:12:52,893 --> 02:12:53,873
[SPEAKER_11]: or to take PARCC.

1542
02:12:54,573 --> 02:12:56,214
[SPEAKER_11]: And we decided to take PARCC.

1543
02:12:57,154 --> 02:13:04,195
[SPEAKER_11]: We realized that the new MCAS 2.0 was coming quickly and that the old MCAS was not going to resemble that.

1544
02:13:04,395 --> 02:13:07,116
[SPEAKER_11]: And the new test was going to be more PARCC-like.

1545
02:13:07,656 --> 02:13:14,857
[SPEAKER_11]: So we opted in grades three through eight in English and mathematics to have our youngsters be taking the PARCC exam.

1546
02:13:16,238 --> 02:13:20,259
[SPEAKER_11]: So what we have tonight are really two different reports.

1547
02:13:20,739 --> 02:13:22,539
[SPEAKER_11]: One of them deals with accountability.

1548
02:13:23,434 --> 02:13:29,256
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, school and district accountability, and that, again, was embargoed until this afternoon.

1549
02:13:30,377 --> 02:13:35,919
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're happy to report that we have moved up from a level three to a level two.

1550
02:13:36,559 --> 02:13:45,663
[SPEAKER_11]: As you know, last year we had one school that was at level three, and because it takes just one, the entire district was into level three.

1551
02:13:45,723 --> 02:13:48,844
[SPEAKER_11]: That school has moved out of level three into level two.

1552
02:13:48,884 --> 02:13:50,085
[SPEAKER_11]: We're quite happy to report.

1553
02:13:50,647 --> 02:13:52,208
[SPEAKER_11]: And the district is now level two.

1554
02:13:52,248 --> 02:13:56,251
[SPEAKER_11]: We'd like to be in level one, but again, we'll work towards that this coming year.

1555
02:13:59,774 --> 02:14:01,135
[SPEAKER_11]: So, let's see.

1556
02:14:01,175 --> 02:14:01,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Accountability.

1557
02:14:01,955 --> 02:14:03,076
[SPEAKER_11]: How do they determine it?

1558
02:14:03,096 --> 02:14:05,378
[SPEAKER_11]: There are really two factors and it's very complex.

1559
02:14:06,298 --> 02:14:10,561
[SPEAKER_11]: One of them is obviously student performance on the exams.

1560
02:14:11,142 --> 02:14:15,685
[SPEAKER_11]: They give scores depending upon how students rate on the exams.

1561
02:14:16,365 --> 02:14:21,066
[SPEAKER_11]: However, there's a second part of accountability rating, and that is your participation.

1562
02:14:21,506 --> 02:14:23,246
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is where it gets a little bit tricky.

1563
02:14:23,886 --> 02:14:35,549
[SPEAKER_11]: Because what they look for is a certain level of participation for the aggregate in the school, that's all the students, and then each subgroup that's reported out.

1564
02:14:36,349 --> 02:14:43,450
[SPEAKER_11]: Every year, they report out, they lower the number of students required to report out a subgroup.

1565
02:14:44,026 --> 02:14:53,234
[SPEAKER_11]: It used to be 40, so in other words, you would not get a report on, let's say, special education unless you had 40 kids in the school.

1566
02:14:53,874 --> 02:14:56,957
[SPEAKER_11]: They gradually over the years lowered it, so now it's 20.

1567
02:14:57,337 --> 02:14:59,459
[SPEAKER_11]: So the threshold for reporting out is now 20.

1568
02:15:00,440 --> 02:15:01,961
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's what we're getting reports on.

1569
02:15:01,981 --> 02:15:09,087
[SPEAKER_11]: So you get more and more subgroups reported out because more and more kids are making up 20 kids within that group.

1570
02:15:09,885 --> 02:15:17,570
[SPEAKER_11]: So what happens with participation is that is factored into the whole accountability.

1571
02:15:18,971 --> 02:15:25,535
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, we basically have done well again with this meeting level two.

1572
02:15:25,995 --> 02:15:29,237
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted to share with you, we just got this just as we left this evening.

1573
02:15:29,978 --> 02:15:34,341
[SPEAKER_11]: We were able to get the comparative accountability ratings of some of the districts.

1574
02:15:34,721 --> 02:15:39,584
[SPEAKER_11]: We thought we'd like to share that with you, because you might be interested in seeing how some of our

1575
02:15:40,054 --> 02:15:40,414
[SPEAKER_11]: neighbors.

1576
02:15:40,594 --> 02:15:50,262
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1577
02:15:50,282 --> 02:15:58,129
[SPEAKER_11]: You can see once you get the sheet that, um, we're actually compared to neighbors doing quite well.

1578
02:15:58,149 --> 02:16:07,216
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, Arlington, you see most of the accountability ratings are to, uh, Belmont is a one, but you have Arlington,

1579
02:16:07,932 --> 02:16:22,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Burlington, Lexington, Linfield, Melrose, North Reading, Stoneham, Wakefield are all level two.

1580
02:16:22,759 --> 02:16:27,661
[SPEAKER_11]: You will also see that other districts nearby, Somerville's a level three.

1581
02:16:28,822 --> 02:16:30,543
[SPEAKER_11]: Malden's a level three.

1582
02:16:30,563 --> 02:16:34,024
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so those are a little bit lower than we are.

1583
02:16:34,945 --> 02:16:37,206
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, many communities that are, you know,

1584
02:16:38,030 --> 02:16:43,131
[SPEAKER_11]: demographically don't have the challenges that we have, are at level two.

1585
02:16:43,652 --> 02:16:48,153
[SPEAKER_11]: So we feel that we're a pretty good company being able to hold to that level.

1586
02:16:48,593 --> 02:16:49,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information, Madam Chairman?

1587
02:16:50,814 --> 02:16:52,234
[SPEAKER_16]: Point of information, Mr. Skerry?

1588
02:16:52,254 --> 02:16:57,595
[SPEAKER_07]: If Salem's rated four, are they a prospect for receivership?

1589
02:16:58,436 --> 02:17:01,256
[SPEAKER_11]: Salem actually moved from four to three.

1590
02:17:02,517 --> 02:17:03,737
[SPEAKER_11]: So what you have here is 2015 and then 2016.

1591
02:17:03,797 --> 02:17:04,737
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can see the movement.

1592
02:17:07,688 --> 02:17:16,976
[SPEAKER_11]: So Salem actually kind of get itself out from under that four level, because they were under scrutiny as a level four, but now they have progressed to level three.

1593
02:17:17,596 --> 02:17:17,997
[SPEAKER_07]: All right?

1594
02:17:18,217 --> 02:17:23,921
[SPEAKER_07]: See, the mall hasn't made any changes, but the state pumps all kinds of money in there and nothing's happened.

1595
02:17:24,842 --> 02:17:25,663
[SPEAKER_11]: What does that tell you?

1596
02:17:27,925 --> 02:17:34,250
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to work with the students that you have, and I know that,

1597
02:17:34,956 --> 02:17:37,877
[SPEAKER_11]: Every teacher in Malden probably works very, very hard with students.

1598
02:17:38,397 --> 02:17:51,260
[SPEAKER_11]: When you have ELL students, and I'm going to share with you what happened at the high school because it kind of highlights some of the problems that we have with this whole system, is that a place like Malden has a lot of ELL students.

1599
02:17:51,380 --> 02:18:00,702
[SPEAKER_11]: And those students are required to take the science test, they're required to take the math test, if they arrive the day before the test is administered.

1600
02:18:01,365 --> 02:18:06,506
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, the only opt out they have is English, and that's only for one year.

1601
02:18:07,126 --> 02:18:12,047
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's really, I mean, is it fair to these students for them to take this test?

1602
02:18:12,127 --> 02:18:12,347
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1603
02:18:13,087 --> 02:18:14,087
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they required to?

1604
02:18:14,147 --> 02:18:14,407
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1605
02:18:14,987 --> 02:18:16,147
[SPEAKER_11]: And therein lies the problem.

1606
02:18:16,188 --> 02:18:24,009
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think what you're seeing in other communities, it's not that they're not spending their money wisely, or they're not following the curriculum, or their teachers aren't doing their jobs.

1607
02:18:24,289 --> 02:18:30,930
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they all are doing that, but the students that they're working with, sometimes the rules around who has to take the exam are not fair.

1608
02:18:31,650 --> 02:18:32,671
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think we're seeing this.

1609
02:18:32,711 --> 02:18:38,234
[SPEAKER_11]: So just to kind of share with you what happened at the high school, because high school is level two and it was level one.

1610
02:18:38,274 --> 02:18:39,335
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's a concern for us.

1611
02:18:39,715 --> 02:18:41,176
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's nothing to do with academics.

1612
02:18:41,556 --> 02:18:45,659
[SPEAKER_11]: Because as we look at the scores of the MCAS scores, the high school did quite well.

1613
02:18:46,159 --> 02:18:51,603
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, in many cases, we moved a lot of kids into advanced from actually the lower levels.

1614
02:18:52,643 --> 02:18:55,205
[SPEAKER_11]: What happened is the participation rate.

1615
02:18:55,605 --> 02:19:00,288
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was only for one subgroup, okay, was the Latin Hispanic subgroup.

1616
02:19:01,398 --> 02:19:05,139
[SPEAKER_11]: And there were only 30, what, 32 kids in that subgroup.

1617
02:19:05,999 --> 02:19:08,159
[SPEAKER_11]: And it had to do with the science test.

1618
02:19:09,199 --> 02:19:17,981
[SPEAKER_11]: And what happened is because the smaller the sample you have of students, the more the statistics are going to be skewed by one or two students.

1619
02:19:18,701 --> 02:19:22,562
[SPEAKER_11]: So we had three, four students who did not take that test.

1620
02:19:22,602 --> 02:19:29,263
[SPEAKER_11]: And the reason they didn't take it is because they were ELL students and you can't take the science test

1621
02:19:29,827 --> 02:19:33,129
[SPEAKER_11]: unless you've taken the rigorous appropriate science course.

1622
02:19:33,669 --> 02:19:38,953
[SPEAKER_11]: These ELL students, no way could they take introductory physics or biology the first year in this country.

1623
02:19:39,473 --> 02:19:47,958
[SPEAKER_11]: So what we designed was a course called general science to give them science, but to build them up slowly so they could take the more rigorous courses.

1624
02:19:48,498 --> 02:19:50,620
[SPEAKER_11]: There is no general science MCAS.

1625
02:19:51,120 --> 02:19:57,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Those students couldn't take the test even if they wanted to, okay, because they didn't take the appropriate course.

1626
02:19:57,424 --> 02:19:59,025
[SPEAKER_11]: So what happened is that we

1627
02:19:59,699 --> 02:20:12,689
[SPEAKER_11]: To be level one, you have to have participation rate of 95%, which means that we have 32 kids, 30 kids would have had to take that test to get to the participation of 95%.

1628
02:20:12,729 --> 02:20:18,554
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, we didn't have the kids taking the test, and that's what happened.

1629
02:20:18,594 --> 02:20:24,639
[SPEAKER_11]: So we don't want to have the misconception that the high school academically declined, it did not.

1630
02:20:24,679 --> 02:20:27,421
[SPEAKER_11]: It actually, in many cases, made improvements.

1631
02:20:28,185 --> 02:20:30,306
[SPEAKER_11]: This participation rate is very tricky.

1632
02:20:30,667 --> 02:20:34,189
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a subgroup, by the way, that was not reported out to us last year.

1633
02:20:34,789 --> 02:20:38,812
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is a subgroup that tends to contain a lot of ELL students.

1634
02:20:39,472 --> 02:20:45,876
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, having no knowledge that this was a problem area, again, we need to pay attention.

1635
02:20:45,896 --> 02:20:57,183
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to, as silly as it sounds, if we're going to try to reach for the goal, the level one, we have to put kids in courses,

1636
02:20:57,915 --> 02:21:05,040
[SPEAKER_11]: ELL kids in rigorous science courses, which I don't think is the right thing to do, and if we want them to take the exam.

1637
02:21:05,220 --> 02:21:06,180
[SPEAKER_11]: Otherwise, they can't take it.

1638
02:21:06,821 --> 02:21:07,421
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a catch-22.

1639
02:21:07,561 --> 02:21:11,944
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a terrible situation that I don't know how we can work around.

1640
02:21:11,964 --> 02:21:13,725
[SPEAKER_11]: They're talking about changing accountability.

1641
02:21:14,185 --> 02:21:17,127
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's hope they change it in that direction, because it's not fair to those kids.

1642
02:21:17,167 --> 02:21:20,149
[SPEAKER_09]: So you might want to know that Boston Latin is level two.

1643
02:21:21,330 --> 02:21:22,050
[SPEAKER_09]: It gives you an idea.

1644
02:21:22,851 --> 02:21:24,172
[SPEAKER_09]: It isn't an academic issue.

1645
02:21:24,512 --> 02:21:25,252
[SPEAKER_11]: Participation.

1646
02:21:25,272 --> 02:21:26,513
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a participation issue.

1647
02:21:27,193 --> 02:21:33,637
[SPEAKER_09]: And we see it in Andover High School and a lot of other places that you would consider to be immune to this.

1648
02:21:33,997 --> 02:21:34,358
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not.

1649
02:21:35,458 --> 02:21:37,620
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a whole discussion that has to happen.

1650
02:21:38,460 --> 02:21:43,103
[SPEAKER_09]: You may remember when AYP, annual adequate yearly progress, was the benchmark.

1651
02:21:44,104 --> 02:21:45,805
[SPEAKER_09]: And everyone was going to be proficient by 2014.

1652
02:21:46,305 --> 02:21:52,349
[SPEAKER_09]: At some point around 2012, 80% of the schools couldn't make it.

1653
02:21:52,829 --> 02:21:53,870
[SPEAKER_09]: So they had to scratch it.

1654
02:21:55,131 --> 02:21:56,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it was an unrealistic target.

1655
02:21:57,848 --> 02:22:09,491
[SPEAKER_09]: As long as you're going to set up some of these, these parameters that don't work for certain youngsters, you're going to have difficulty making it on the participation level or on the achievement level as well.

1656
02:22:09,971 --> 02:22:11,792
[SPEAKER_09]: But this is what we're facing.

1657
02:22:11,852 --> 02:22:14,812
[SPEAKER_09]: So there'll be some discussions at the state level about this.

1658
02:22:15,173 --> 02:22:19,454
[SPEAKER_09]: The new federal act ESSA gives the states more flexibility.

1659
02:22:19,494 --> 02:22:20,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see what they do with it.

1660
02:22:21,234 --> 02:22:24,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see what kind of discussion they have on that level.

1661
02:22:25,112 --> 02:22:31,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Because obviously if they don't have a discussion, you're going to see the same phenomenon as you saw with AYP.

1662
02:22:31,636 --> 02:22:33,717
[SPEAKER_09]: There's going to be more and more districts that drop down.

1663
02:22:34,677 --> 02:22:36,578
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's not going to fly.

1664
02:22:37,899 --> 02:22:46,844
[SPEAKER_11]: So I guess that comes down to as a district, do you make an ELL kid suffer through a year of coursework that they can't understand at all?

1665
02:22:46,864 --> 02:22:52,327
[SPEAKER_11]: Or do you put them in a more reasonable course where they can really learn something, but then we run into this problem.

1666
02:22:53,077 --> 02:22:57,278
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the catch 22 that we're dealing with, but again, we are level two.

1667
02:22:57,659 --> 02:23:01,140
[SPEAKER_11]: We'd like to be level one, but I think we've made progress on that.

1668
02:23:02,400 --> 02:23:04,561
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, you have what our neighbors have done as well.

1669
02:23:04,961 --> 02:23:17,285
[SPEAKER_11]: The state assessment, the only comparisons we really can make right now would be with the MCAS, because we don't have data from PARC from last year to compare with the results last year.

1670
02:23:17,865 --> 02:23:20,126
[SPEAKER_11]: So what the directors did is they prepared.

1671
02:23:20,714 --> 02:23:23,936
[SPEAKER_11]: Summaries, they did the highlights of the MCAS for grade 10.

1672
02:23:24,777 --> 02:23:30,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Because the science is grade 5, 8, and high school, Mr. Cieri did all three grade levels.

1673
02:23:30,942 --> 02:23:34,304
[SPEAKER_11]: You can kind of read over the highlights, look at the data.

1674
02:23:34,624 --> 02:23:35,825
[SPEAKER_11]: We have the data for you.

1675
02:23:36,406 --> 02:23:40,509
[SPEAKER_11]: The park, because it's so new, we're still in the process of examining it.

1676
02:23:40,549 --> 02:23:44,391
[SPEAKER_11]: We have numbers, but we're still trying to put some meaning to the numbers.

1677
02:23:45,112 --> 02:23:49,155
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the things that you should know is that park is scored very differently.

1678
02:23:49,707 --> 02:23:58,393
[SPEAKER_11]: than MCAS, where MCAS has the four categories, advanced, proficient, needs improvement, and warning, or unsatisfactory.

1679
02:23:59,254 --> 02:24:04,097
[SPEAKER_11]: The park is judged on a five point scale.

1680
02:24:04,697 --> 02:24:15,865
[SPEAKER_11]: And so the designations are that somebody has exceeded expectations, met expectations, approximated expectations, partially met, and so on.

1681
02:24:15,945 --> 02:24:18,727
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a very, and we don't quite understand

1682
02:24:19,625 --> 02:24:20,665
[SPEAKER_11]: all of the meaning behind that.

1683
02:24:20,685 --> 02:24:22,026
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what we're looking at next.

1684
02:24:22,146 --> 02:24:31,669
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, we were told that there's not going to be a state report in terms of how the students did statewide, because some of the students still took MCAS.

1685
02:24:32,169 --> 02:24:38,251
[SPEAKER_11]: So to do a comparison with state park results would leave out a lot of districts.

1686
02:24:38,691 --> 02:24:43,752
[SPEAKER_11]: So we've been told, although I'm not sure that could change, that the state's not going to give us a comparison figure.

1687
02:24:44,112 --> 02:24:46,233
[SPEAKER_11]: So we may not even be able to say Medford did

1688
02:24:47,071 --> 02:24:54,554
[SPEAKER_11]: So much better or so much worse in each category than the state, because we don't have that data right now, and we've been told we're not going to get it.

1689
02:24:54,614 --> 02:24:55,894
[SPEAKER_11]: But we will be looking at that.

1690
02:24:56,454 --> 02:25:03,397
[SPEAKER_11]: The student reports, all of them, MCAS and PARC, will be arriving at our doorsteps on the next couple of days.

1691
02:25:03,937 --> 02:25:07,538
[SPEAKER_11]: Our plan is to get the results out to parents by the end of the week.

1692
02:25:08,119 --> 02:25:09,139
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's kind of our plan.

1693
02:25:13,477 --> 02:25:22,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Have educators and teachers indicated to the Department of Education, if the kids are having a problem with science, why can't they take it in their native language?

1694
02:25:22,541 --> 02:25:25,822
[SPEAKER_06]: It might give them a leg up so that they can further progress.

1695
02:25:27,583 --> 02:25:30,444
[SPEAKER_11]: They used to have MCAS when it all started.

1696
02:25:30,545 --> 02:25:32,685
[SPEAKER_11]: They used to have a Spanish version of it.

1697
02:25:33,186 --> 02:25:34,046
[SPEAKER_11]: They did away with it.

1698
02:25:34,226 --> 02:25:35,327
[SPEAKER_11]: This is for English and math.

1699
02:25:36,287 --> 02:25:42,890
[SPEAKER_11]: The thinking with ELL is that these students have to be fully immersed in

1700
02:25:43,630 --> 02:25:45,091
[SPEAKER_11]: the language as soon as possible.

1701
02:25:45,111 --> 02:25:54,055
[SPEAKER_11]: The testing though is, it's just bothersome because it's just like, you know, someone giving us a test in Arabic and we've only been here for, you know.

1702
02:25:54,115 --> 02:25:59,697
[SPEAKER_06]: I think from the state's point of view it would be advantageous if they know there's a certain test that the kids can't pass.

1703
02:26:00,278 --> 02:26:04,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not, you know, make it a little easier for them and then they can pick up speed along the way.

1704
02:26:06,100 --> 02:26:09,582
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a discussion between the House and the Senate.

1705
02:26:09,602 --> 02:26:10,002
[SPEAKER_09]: They're both

1706
02:26:10,616 --> 02:26:14,057
[SPEAKER_09]: have different viewpoints on the bilingual or ELL laws.

1707
02:26:16,177 --> 02:26:19,098
[SPEAKER_09]: The Senate would like to change what the UNS amendment did.

1708
02:26:19,178 --> 02:26:26,780
[SPEAKER_09]: The House is still moving around on it a little bit, and they haven't been able to reach any kind of consensus.

1709
02:26:27,600 --> 02:26:29,961
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a lot of ferment around this stuff right now.

1710
02:26:30,781 --> 02:26:37,883
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing I think that becomes obvious to us is that these tests

1711
02:26:38,575 --> 02:26:47,257
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, last year they try to use something called the equity percentile to try to find some sort of crossover between MCAS and park.

1712
02:26:48,657 --> 02:26:55,518
[SPEAKER_09]: We think it was a very full attempt to try and compare two very different tests and notice the state isn't going to do it this year.

1713
02:26:56,078 --> 02:26:56,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1714
02:26:56,578 --> 02:27:05,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously somebody came to the same conclusion, even though, you know, last year we said to them, we don't think this works.

1715
02:27:06,120 --> 02:27:06,640
[SPEAKER_09]: And, um,

1716
02:27:07,704 --> 02:27:11,326
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they came to the conclusion that since they couldn't really compare all the districts.

1717
02:27:11,706 --> 02:27:17,590
[SPEAKER_09]: And we think, to some degree, that impacted our scores last year and impacted our rating last year.

1718
02:27:18,090 --> 02:27:21,592
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just our thinking about it, but I can't prove it, so be it.

1719
02:27:22,507 --> 02:27:22,747
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

1720
02:27:22,767 --> 02:27:23,147
[SPEAKER_16]: Vanderhoof.

1721
02:27:23,508 --> 02:27:48,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Madam Chair, since the results were just released this afternoon and school committee members have only received the preliminary report, I think that with the information that was provided so far by the deputy superintendent, that at this point it seems like it would be appropriate for us to move this to a subcommittee meeting when the rest of the analysis has been done.

1722
02:27:49,300 --> 02:27:57,888
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd make a motion to move it to the curriculum subcommittee meeting Could I second by oh, could I just ask a question before we do that?

1723
02:27:58,489 --> 02:28:15,644
[SPEAKER_04]: I I had a question I was waiting to ask so I wanted to know because I know the results are coming out this week and So that the parents or you know, the students who are 10th graders who are now juniors in you know, they're gonna get their results and

1724
02:28:16,095 --> 02:28:19,937
[SPEAKER_04]: they need to know if they have to take the retest as soon as possible.

1725
02:28:19,957 --> 02:28:20,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1726
02:28:21,077 --> 02:28:27,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, how quickly is that information going to be made available to those parents and the students?

1727
02:28:27,920 --> 02:28:35,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, cause I know that there was prep work that was done, MCAS prep that's done and you know, what are the plans for that?

1728
02:28:35,964 --> 02:28:45,488
[SPEAKER_04]: And are those students, if they have to take the retest where the MCAS 2.0 isn't going to be out till next spring,

1729
02:28:46,440 --> 02:28:52,702
[SPEAKER_04]: the students have to take the retest coming up this November, because that's, I don't know the exact date, but it's November.

1730
02:28:52,722 --> 02:28:53,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1731
02:28:53,343 --> 02:28:55,784
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, what are the plans?

1732
02:28:55,824 --> 02:29:01,106
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, my son's a junior and, you know, this is, you know, the big, you know, grade we're waiting for.

1733
02:29:01,546 --> 02:29:03,407
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know there's a lot of other parents out there.

1734
02:29:03,867 --> 02:29:11,030
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, you know, a lot of anxiety around that, you know, scoring and, you know, and where it's the new tests, you know.

1735
02:29:11,850 --> 02:29:12,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1736
02:29:12,717 --> 02:29:20,521
[SPEAKER_11]: The retest, first of all, would be the old MCAS test, because the MCAS 2.0 is still in the developmental phases.

1737
02:29:20,681 --> 02:29:21,842
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so that's not ready.

1738
02:29:22,482 --> 02:29:26,324
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they're very ambitious to think they're going to have it ready for the spring, but they're telling us they are.

1739
02:29:27,125 --> 02:29:28,806
[SPEAKER_11]: The results will go home to parents.

1740
02:29:28,846 --> 02:29:36,590
[SPEAKER_11]: As soon as we get those in tomorrow or the next day is when we've been told by the state, we'll get the principals to pick them up.

1741
02:29:37,390 --> 02:29:38,431
[SPEAKER_11]: Labels are made.

1742
02:29:38,751 --> 02:29:42,013
[SPEAKER_11]: Our goal is to ship them out by, if we get them on time this week.

1743
02:29:42,593 --> 02:29:46,917
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to ship them out by Friday to everyone, so people will know by next week.

1744
02:29:47,597 --> 02:29:54,023
[SPEAKER_11]: In terms of the plans to do the retest, again, this is just the high school level, obviously.

1745
02:29:54,603 --> 02:29:56,805
[SPEAKER_11]: As you know, we don't have our academic support money.

1746
02:29:56,925 --> 02:29:57,906
[SPEAKER_11]: They did away with the grant.

1747
02:29:58,287 --> 02:30:04,672
[SPEAKER_11]: And the academic support grant used to support the MCAS prep, both for the 10th grade test and for the retest.

1748
02:30:05,092 --> 02:30:09,096
[SPEAKER_11]: But I know that Mr. Blau and Dr. Perrella and Dr. Riccio are looking for ways.

1749
02:30:09,788 --> 02:30:19,295
[SPEAKER_11]: to get those kids, whether we have to put some of the district money into this to get some tutors, we try to get those kids ready for that, retest as soon as possible.

1750
02:30:19,315 --> 02:30:35,547
[SPEAKER_11]: So they'll have a good month to be able to prep, and I know the high school's already trying to be creative in finding ways we can use, find money to make sure these kids, because the MCAS academic support money was really very helpful.

1751
02:30:36,448 --> 02:30:36,828
[SPEAKER_11]: It's gone.

1752
02:30:37,922 --> 02:30:41,483
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a concern, because that was a great program.

1753
02:30:41,523 --> 02:30:46,784
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like a six-week program for the students who needed help with either math or the English.

1754
02:30:46,864 --> 02:31:01,427
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know if I can make a motion that we can make some budget money available for those students to get the prep and the assistance they need to help them so they can graduate.

1755
02:31:01,447 --> 02:31:06,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this is a big deal, and students need the assistance.

1756
02:31:07,794 --> 02:31:09,534
[SPEAKER_04]: some of them struggle with testing.

1757
02:31:10,695 --> 02:31:22,817
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the strategies I know, you know, that the students learned was, you know, helpful and the repetition, you know, and where there was a break over the summer and, you know, things are, you know, getting back into the swing of things.

1758
02:31:24,358 --> 02:31:28,679
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think it's definitely something that we need to make a priority for the students.

1759
02:31:29,859 --> 02:31:33,340
[SPEAKER_11]: I will be with the highest, as soon as we get the scores in and we see where we stand

1760
02:31:34,107 --> 02:31:35,948
[SPEAKER_11]: the number of kids who have to take the retest.

1761
02:31:35,988 --> 02:31:38,790
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe we don't have anybody, maybe they all passed, which would be very nice.

1762
02:31:39,290 --> 02:31:43,453
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'll meet with the high school staff next week and we'll work something out.

1763
02:31:43,493 --> 02:31:50,417
[SPEAKER_11]: There's usually not a huge number of kids, so we'll find something that works because we want them to get diplomas.

1764
02:31:50,437 --> 02:31:53,258
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1765
02:31:53,458 --> 02:31:55,620
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's currently two motions on the floor.

1766
02:31:55,640 --> 02:32:00,923
[SPEAKER_16]: The first motion is to conduct an academic committee subcommittee meeting.

1767
02:32:02,165 --> 02:32:08,026
[SPEAKER_16]: where we can go over all testing results that were recently released.

1768
02:32:08,106 --> 02:32:09,047
[SPEAKER_16]: Curriculum subcommittee.

1769
02:32:09,347 --> 02:32:12,867
[SPEAKER_16]: Curriculum subcommittee, sorry.

1770
02:32:12,967 --> 02:32:13,867
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1771
02:32:16,728 --> 02:32:16,908
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1772
02:32:16,928 --> 02:32:29,371
[SPEAKER_16]: And we have a second motion by Mrs. Brents for the superintendent to provide us a cost report of implementing a six-week MCAS prep program so that way in

1773
02:32:31,531 --> 02:32:36,654
[SPEAKER_16]: as quickly as possible so we can help all of our high school students.

1774
02:32:36,694 --> 02:32:38,795
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll assess how many students are involved.

1775
02:32:38,955 --> 02:32:39,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1776
02:32:39,095 --> 02:32:39,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1777
02:32:39,275 --> 02:32:39,335
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

1778
02:32:39,355 --> 02:32:40,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we'll have to find out.

1779
02:32:40,836 --> 02:32:48,020

1780
02:32:48,040 --> 02:32:50,121
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll get to that as soon as we get the results.

[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1782
02:32:50,581 --> 02:32:51,922

[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1795
02:33:11,280 --> 02:33:11,920
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

02:33:12,781 --> 02:33:13,481
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion carries.

1797
02:33:13,501 --> 02:33:20,285
[SPEAKER_16]: Our next item is negotiations on legal matters.

1798
02:33:20,305 --> 02:33:21,385
[SPEAKER_16]: There are none.

1799
02:33:22,686 --> 02:33:23,587
[SPEAKER_16]: Old business.

1800
02:33:24,087 --> 02:33:28,229
[SPEAKER_16]: We have selection of delegates for the MASC fall conference.

1801
02:33:28,829 --> 02:33:29,910
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Superintendent?

1802
02:33:30,800 --> 02:33:35,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Just up to you to decide who you want to be the delegate and the alternate to the conference at this point in time.

1803
02:33:35,941 --> 02:33:38,362
[SPEAKER_09]: We put it off from last meeting, so we're on tonight.

1804
02:33:38,882 --> 02:33:39,702
[SPEAKER_16]: Mrs. Van der Kloot.

1805
02:33:39,722 --> 02:33:45,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam Chairman, I nominate Mrs. Van der Kloot to be the alternate.

1806
02:33:45,584 --> 02:33:46,704
[SPEAKER_16]: Mrs. Van der Kloot.

1807
02:33:47,164 --> 02:33:56,546
[SPEAKER_01]: I accept the nomination, and after discussion with Mr. Scurry, where he assures me he will attend the meeting, I nominate Mr. Scurry to be the delegate to the MAFC full conference.

1808
02:33:56,946 --> 02:33:58,167
[SPEAKER_16]: We have two nominations.

1809
02:33:58,187 --> 02:33:58,927
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we have a second?

1810
02:34:00,173 --> 02:34:01,174
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we need a second on that?

1811
02:34:02,095 --> 02:34:02,836

02:34:03,016 --> 02:34:03,436

1821
02:34:13,966 --> 02:34:14,807

[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1823
02:34:17,510 --> 02:34:20,052
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Benedetto?

1824
02:34:20,192 --> 02:34:20,472
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1825
02:34:20,552 --> 02:34:21,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Mrs. Kreatz?

1826
02:34:21,654 --> 02:34:21,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1827
02:34:22,194 --> 02:34:22,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Mrs. Stone?

1828
02:34:22,895 --> 02:34:23,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1829
02:34:23,175 --> 02:34:23,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Skerry?

1830
02:34:23,695 --> 02:34:23,896
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1831
02:34:24,176 --> 02:34:24,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

1832
02:34:24,336 --> 02:34:24,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Van der Kloot?

1833
02:34:24,957 --> 02:34:25,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1834
02:34:25,819 --> 02:34:36,766
[SPEAKER_16]: So also on this report, we have a report from the superintendent on the cost involved in attending.

1835
02:34:38,767 --> 02:34:39,768
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Superintendent?

1836
02:34:41,109 --> 02:34:43,690
[SPEAKER_09]: So we gave you a report on the cost.

1837
02:34:43,730 --> 02:34:45,191
[SPEAKER_09]: They're actually spelled out for you.

1838
02:34:45,372 --> 02:34:53,657
[SPEAKER_09]: And if someone wanted to only go for one or two days, MASC indicated that we could talk to them about it, depending on what their numbers look like.

1839
02:34:54,662 --> 02:34:59,964
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to say that I'm really happy that both of my colleagues are going to be able to get there for the vote.

1840
02:34:59,984 --> 02:35:02,425
[SPEAKER_09]: That's an important and very important piece of this conference.

1841
02:35:02,505 --> 02:35:05,986
[SPEAKER_09]: It gives us some room at the table, which is nice for our opinions to be heard.

1842
02:35:23,563 --> 02:35:32,307
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to commit to the whole four days because I am actually working right now on trying to get unpaid leave to get down there, but my cost will be less.

1843
02:35:32,888 --> 02:35:36,730
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe Paulette's cost will be less because we're both lifetime members.

1844
02:35:37,370 --> 02:35:40,652
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will inform the superintendent of the days that I'll be going.

1845
02:35:42,032 --> 02:35:42,893
[SPEAKER_16]: Any other questions?

1846
02:35:44,133 --> 02:35:50,657
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd like to make a motion at this time that the superintendent report back to the school committee the total cost of all expenses.

1847
02:35:51,575 --> 02:35:53,196
[SPEAKER_16]: with attending this conference.

1848
02:35:54,918 --> 02:35:55,638
[SPEAKER_16]: I need a second.

1849
02:35:57,040 --> 02:35:57,520
[SPEAKER_16]: I second.

1850
02:35:58,381 --> 02:35:59,241
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion carried.

1851
02:35:59,421 --> 02:36:00,482
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor, aye?

1852
02:36:00,963 --> 02:36:01,203
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1853
02:36:01,363 --> 02:36:02,764
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

1854
02:36:03,385 --> 02:36:05,466
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion accepted.

1855
02:36:05,607 --> 02:36:08,449
[SPEAKER_16]: Item approved to be placed on file.

1856
02:36:09,970 --> 02:36:10,811

1857
02:36:11,091 --> 02:36:11,752
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1858
02:36:12,412 --> 02:36:13,333
[SPEAKER_16]: That's accepted.

1859
02:36:13,873 --> 02:36:14,774
[SPEAKER_16]: Communications?

1860
02:36:17,596 --> 02:36:19,018
[SPEAKER_16]: None.

1861
02:36:19,298 --> 02:36:20,459
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, there is one.

1862
02:36:22,689 --> 02:36:26,732
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to ask Mr. Skerry to read tonight's motion.

1863
02:36:27,753 --> 02:36:28,454
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Skerry.

1864
02:36:38,803 --> 02:36:45,348
[SPEAKER_06]: That the admitted school committee extend its condolences to the family of Frank Andre, who passed away this week.

1865
02:36:46,509 --> 02:36:47,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Frank's daughter,

1866
02:36:47,522 --> 02:36:49,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Kara is a teacher in the special ed department.

1867
02:36:49,884 --> 02:36:52,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Frank was very active in civic affairs in the community.

1868
02:36:53,426 --> 02:36:57,009
[SPEAKER_06]: He had two great passions, horse racing and youth baseball.

1869
02:36:57,089 --> 02:36:59,891
[SPEAKER_06]: He was a little league coach in North Medford for many years.

1870
02:37:01,232 --> 02:37:04,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Later years, he lived across the street from the park on Fulton Street.

1871
02:37:05,515 --> 02:37:10,279
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was a 24-7 watchman and always had plenty of advice for the youngsters.

1872
02:37:11,328 --> 02:37:12,809
[SPEAKER_06]: I consider Frank a good friend.

1873
02:37:12,869 --> 02:37:18,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Frank would always call me and let me know what we're doing right here, what we're doing wrong, and how things should change.

1874
02:37:19,292 --> 02:37:24,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Frank was also a candidate for this austere body in 1951 when my dad was serving.

1875
02:37:26,036 --> 02:37:26,957
[SPEAKER_06]: He'll be sorely missed.

1876
02:37:27,477 --> 02:37:32,820
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, our condolences go out to the Andre family, and I ask that we observe a moment of silence for Frank.

1877
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:34,781
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor, please.

1878
02:37:46,015 --> 02:37:47,578
[SPEAKER_16]: Condolences sent to the family.

1879
02:37:48,180 --> 02:37:49,222
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. Skerry.

1880
02:37:50,765 --> 02:37:52,809
[SPEAKER_16]: That concludes our business for this evening.

1881
02:37:52,829 --> 02:37:55,735
[SPEAKER_16]: Meeting has been adjourned.

1882
02:37:56,357 --> 02:37:57,239
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to adjourn.
