    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=110.383s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=111.924s">Again,</a>  this is, um, this is another, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=116.394s">another</a>  process where you see the CCSR program assisting young people with innovative ideas that give back to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=126.384s">We</a>  had two fifth graders that saw the need after witnessing the holdup of <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=137.154s">one</a>  of the mail carriers on TV, and I believe they took it upon themselves, both Savannah and Adam, two Brooks students, to find a way to assist our mail carriers for their safety and providing them with whistles for, and this is so, it sounds so simple, but it's the minds of great, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=163.427s">two</a>  great individuals that were raised the right way, that saw a need and they stepped up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=168.952s">In</a>  typical Medford fashion, this is what makes Medford Medford, that we have young people seeing the need for something, reaching out to their school and the CCSR to really put something together. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=185.967s">And</a>  we should all celebrate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=188.809s">I'd</a>  make the motion that we invite them to our next meeting and hopefully give them a citation and really applaud their effort for what they've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=199.799s">So</a>  thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=201.84s">I'm</a>  sure you have much to say as well.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=204.803s">Yes,</a>  I mean, I think you have said most of it, but you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=209.051s">A,</a>  our postal workers are doing incredibly important work that I know lately under incredibly difficult circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=216.755s">So</a>  I'm grateful that young people in the city are taking up the mantle of trying to provide some community service. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=225.079s">And</a>  our CCSR across every school in the district does amazing work. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=228.921s">So</a>  I want to thank all the students and the educators who make it happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=234.023s">I</a>  do want to go to Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=237.298s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears, and thank you to both you and Councilor Scarpelli for putting this on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=243.64s">I</a>  think these items on tonight's agenda really show the great work that's happening in our public school system right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=252.642s">This</a>  item in particular, I think, really exemplifies the proactive spirit and the innovative spirit that we see from so many of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=261.844s">And</a>  I think it really goes, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=266.091s">it's,</a>  I think it should be noticed, right, that these are our young folks, our young students at the Brooks Elementary School, which kind of like shows us that no matter what age you are, Medford students are stepping up and stepping up to meet the demands of the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=284.284s">I</a>  think it's also really important to <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=287.429s">celebrate</a>  the CCSR, such a wonderful organization that we have in our schools that allow our young folks to get stuff like this done and to get experience about how to make change and to respond so quickly to events in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=303.064s">So</a>  really, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=304.986s">You</a>  know, I want to heap praise on the educators as well, who've spent so much time organizing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=309.327s">I</a>  know it's a lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=310.888s">And</a>  having been involved in the organization itself, I know it takes a lot of work from both the students and the teachers to really carry through and execute a project like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=322.17s">So</a>  really proud of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=324.691s">And</a>  I think there's so much more that we can look forward to for the CCSR and our students and all of our students in general.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=350.192s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=351.492s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=351.593s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=351.673s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=351.773s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=352.033s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=352.393s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=363.49s">Yes,</a>  70 affirmative, none negative, the motion passes. <a href="../resolutions/24-086.pdf"><font color="green">24-086</font></a> by myself and Councilor Scarpelli, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we congratulate former Councilor Rick Caraviello on the honour of being named 2024 Citizen of the Year by the Medford Chamber of Commerce, and we thank Rick for his decades of service to the city of Medford and his residence.
 <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=381.294s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=382.114s">Thank</a>  you, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=383.634s">This</a>  is an amazing resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=386.595s">I</a>  thought that, you know, if you all leadership, and we brought it up, I just thought that <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=392.29s">a</a>  resolution for a great person, even before Rick Caraviello put his name out there to run for mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=399.936s">Rick,</a>  as a Medford Mustang and a committed member of this community, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=411.533s">with</a>  no fanfare. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=412.513s">And</a>  I think no one really would have known what Rick has done if he didn't run for mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=416.515s">And</a>  they use it as platforms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=417.855s">And</a>  I know Rick, he was very taken back. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=420.956s">He</a>  didn't want to talk about the things he did, because Rick Caraviello was the person that did everything when nobody was looking. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=429.171s">and</a>  he didn't want anybody to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=431.412s">So</a>  that's what's amazing about the person. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=433.953s">And</a>  being named the citizen of the year, I think is an amazing award for an amazing person. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=441.036s">So</a>  the fact that if I had the opportunity to go to the banquet, listen to him speak, and you see the names on that list of the former, the former, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=454.861s">you</a>  know, honorees of that award, and you see the greatness. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=458.644s">And</a>  when I say the greatness, it's just people giving back. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=463.667s">It's</a>  just people loving Medford, and people giving back to the community, and especially those people that give back when no one's looking. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=470.972s">I</a>  know we have a few people here, I think Rick Orlando's here, one person is a former award winner. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=477.716s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=480.117s">This</a>  is, this is for someone I'm glad Zach brought this up that I'd like Rick to come out and I think we should really honor him, even if I know he's going to be a little bit quicker. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=490.666s">He</a>  had knee replacement, so he'll get to the, he'll get to the podium a little quicker, but, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=496.554s">You</a>  know, I'm honored to call him my friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=498.516s">I'm</a>  honored that I got to serve with him on this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=501.458s">And</a>  I'm honored that I got to watch him help so many and teach me that selflessness to just give back when no one's watching and see the impacts it made in people's lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=514.426s">I</a>  know that he read a few stories that people wanted to read because of his award. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=520.751s">And</a>  you realize the impact that <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=523.223s">that</a>  he never intended to make and how moving it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=527.646s">So</a>  to my friend, congratulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=530.548s">And</a>  again, I would love to invite him, Council President, to our next meeting and him and his lovely wife, Carol, because I know that if it wasn't for Carol, he wouldn't be able to do all those selfless things that he's done for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=546.778s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=548.158s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=549.119s">Any</a>  further comments from members of the Council on this paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=551.38s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=553.151s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=554.171s">I</a>  thank you very much and Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=558.473s">Former</a>  Councilor Caraviello was clearly a man for whom, you know, showing up for his community and doing right by other people was simply a way of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=565.955s">It</a>  was simply his instinct, you know, regardless of, you know, politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=572.397s">And</a>  I know people put a lot of that, you know, especially onto this council and these chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=576.018s">But</a>  from knowing Rick for a couple of years, you know, I think anybody who meets him knows him. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=581.363s">you</a>  know, you see his heart on his sleeve. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=582.925s">And</a>  I think it's just wonderful to see that recognized in the community, you know, the spirit of service by which he's truly lived his entire life in many roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=591.693s">I'm</a>  glad to see him acknowledged. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=593.455s">And</a>  I will say I miss seeing him every Tuesday and Wednesday in the chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=597.439s">So</a>  congratulations.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=600.162s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=601.363s">Councilor</a>  Tsengeed.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=602.739s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=603.7s">I'd</a>  like to ditto everything that's been said so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=607.142s">I</a>  miss seeing him in the chambers as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=610.484s">I</a>  think it really, I mean, I think all community members can really see how much Rick. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=618.086s">former</a>  councilor is given to our community, both in his capacity as a city councilor, but also just as a private citizen in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=626.198s">His</a>  leadership really speaks volumes, especially when you look at the effects of his leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=631.866s">When</a>  you look at the people that he's helped. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=634.549s">For</a>  me, Rick means a lot to me, because he was such a mentor to me in the council chambers and in getting involved in Medford politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=644.502s">He</a>  really, I think, showed me what leadership looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=652.072s">saying</a>  words, he showed me the actions, and he showed me how you build those connections, how you get to know folks who live at home and all the business owners, and how you listen to them more empathetically. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=665.796s">And</a>  really, I think that spirit is something that's so important to the jobs that we do as city councillors.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=676.818s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=678.539s">I'll</a>  just say that I echo my fellow Councilors' comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=682.901s">Serving</a>  with Rick for my first two terms on the Council, some of them with Rick in leadership, through the pandemic, it was a powerful time, an interesting time, and we sometimes agreed, sometimes disagreed, but always got along before and after meetings, agreed to disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=703.144s">definitely</a>  work together behind the scenes on several projects, just trying to, you know, go at things from our perspectives and try to advance different proposals, work with different property owners and people who wanted to bring development to our community and try to <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=718.354s">I</a>  encourage that in different ways and I know that that was a big passion of Rick's and he is someone who I hope will continue to do that advocacy as a private citizen. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=728.64s">I</a>  also just have spoken to so many people involved with our new Metro Public Library. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=733.502s">who</a>  are very grateful to former Councilor Caraviello for his work to bring that library to our community, work with the Library Foundation, along with many others. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=744.309s">And</a>  he really was a leader of that, and we have now a beautiful public library, and at a very reasonable cost to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=755.556s">So</a>  it was a great accomplishment, and I know that he's very proud of it, and we're all very grateful to him for his work. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=762.426s">Any</a>  further comment on the resolution? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=767.907s">Seeing</a>  none, on the motion by myself and Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=773.969s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=813.985s">Thank</a>  you so much President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=816.788s">As</a>  many of us know, Medford is home to one of our state's strongest music and arts programs in our public school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=824.878s">Thanks</a>  to the leadership of many teachers, one of whom <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=829.503s">I</a>  know very personally, Miss Sophia Chang, she has developed this program at the middle school and high school levels of a string ensemble and the string orchestra program where students are really learning top level skills in arts and in strings playing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=849.773s">I've</a>  had the opportunity to listen to high school players from around the state, working with a lot of them, teaching them, playing with them, and truly Medford has something very, very special. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=865.645s">I'm</a>  so, so happy that our orchestras won awards at the MICA Festival, which is a festival I played in a long, long time ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=874.992s">And</a>  it's a very difficult stage to perform on. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=877.894s">You're</a>  performing in front of a crowd of judges, a crowd of music professionals who are all very well renowned in their fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=885.56s">And</a>  to be able to overcome those nerves, and not only just overcome those nerves, but to win gold and silver medals with a very strict scoring system, I think speaks really highly to the level of our students to compete and to perform on such a really high level. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=903.332s">I</a>  wanted to amend this resolution to invite the students into our next regular meeting on May 14th to receive citations and to invite them for a short performance for the City Council if the Council will indulge the orchestra.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1130.302s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1131.003s">So</a>  at the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee, we first discussed the first April newsletter of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1138.529s">So</a>  I sent copies around of that or drafts around that to all of my fellow council members and flagged down potential edits to those, as well as a schedule that Councilors would go by month to month to draft the newsletter prior to submitting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1157.165s">to</a>  the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1157.966s">Most</a>  of the committee session was dedicated to editing the newsletter, so it was a bit of a bit of a Word document session as I took in edits and suggestions in real time and tried to correct my own draft language there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1176.158s">Following</a>  that, there was a <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1178.98s">motion</a>  to send the newsletter to regular session, but that motion didn't receive a second, so we decided to, so we ended up voting on a motion to approve the newsletter entirely and send it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1196.249s">So</a>  it was, so the first draft of it is currently on the Medford City Council page. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1201.671s">We're</a>  currently discussing <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1203.416s">methods</a>  of circulating that around the community with the communications director and the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1209.123s">Additionally,</a>  we voted to establish listening sessions, ended up voting to establish the subcommittee consisting of myself, Councilor Callahan and Councilor Tseng to <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1221.149s">organize</a>  those in order to establish monthly listening sessions in which a few City Council members would meet up with the community of seniors, the community of tough students, veterans, as well as the five community liaisons in Medford in order to have City Council do active outreach to different members of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1251.489s">And,</a>  yeah, that was pretty much all we discussed.</p>

</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1304.67s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1305.73s">We</a>  had the pleasure of having Commissioner Tim McGibbon as well as our engineer Owen Wartella there to discuss our roads and sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1314.094s">There</a>  had been a pavement assessment done in 2021, and we got to see the pavement assessment that was just done recently as an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1323.718s">We,</a>  there were, you know, essentially they talked us through how the roads have, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1332.657s">basically</a>  what they have been doing with the roads, which includes coordinating with the utilities when they need to do repairs on the road, making sure that utilities are, in fact, doing all the road repair that they are supposed to be doing, as well as getting all the different kinds of funding that they possibly can. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1352.01s">We</a>  are, in fact, repairing roads at approximately... There were five different strategies that were recommended, and we are repairing the roads <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1361.797s">better</a>  than the middle strategy, but not as well as the top strategy because we do not have the funding to do that level of repair to the roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1372.861s">So</a>  if there is going to be an improvement in the roads in Medford, it does look like funding will have to increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1382.865s">It</a>  just comes straight out of both of those pavement assessments. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1386.176s">And</a>  that was what we discussed in, oh, they also have, they bought the equipment to do a hot tub crew, to have an internal crew doing road repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1397.604s">They</a>  just need to have to access the funding to be able to staff that, which we think will be less expensive than, for certain levels of repair will be less expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1409.651s">So</a>  that's the update for that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1410.834s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1411.094s">I</a>  think just to add to that there was a response to your question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1415.46s">What</a>  would it cost him and Tim McGibbon set up 400,000 to 700,000 depending on the scale of the staffing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1421.767s">And</a>  that would move us from having a crew out two to three times a month to two to three times a week.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1426.946s">So</a>  I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1427.726s">I</a>  believe that if I can, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1429.947s">I</a>  apologize, because I couldn't get on. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1433.388s">I</a>  was listening and I couldn't get on to the last second and I apologize for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1437.449s">But</a>  I know that engineer Olin said that we're looking at substantial figures, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1443.891s">What,</a>  $6 million a year to catch up?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1447.633s">Five</a>  years, 6 million? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1448.833s">The</a>  middle path that Councilor Callahan was mentioning was 3.5 million a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1453.754s">And</a>  that's basically, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1455.595s">the</a>  line was going down ever so slightly on the condition of the roads for 6 million a year we had an increase in conditions and he said that we were between those two numbers right now and he's now working for the first time in the city to estimate <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1471.195s">When</a>  utilities repair the roads, what's the dollar value of that relative? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1474.517s">And</a>  then you could add up Chapter 90 bond money. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1477.218s">That's</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1478.079s">That's</a>  good to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1479.28s">So</a>  we're somewhere in between those two. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1482.061s">If</a>  I can, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1483.042s">Yes,</a>  Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1484.382s">If</a>  I can, I didn't realize.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1487.124s">Could</a>  we just have a 24.015 and 24.073? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1487.904s">I</a>  won't be supporting that paper, so I apologize.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1974.292s">Well,</a>  it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1976.909s">very</a>  much community driven, so we've never stayed open, nor do I think we will ever be open until 1 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1984.531s">in</a>  Medford, there just isn't a calling for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1988.912s">It's</a>  generally when it's a private reservation, it's often people from City Hall that request for the anniversary, retirement, birthday party, and they wanna come in from 10 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2002.355s">And</a>  everyone says they're gonna stay until one, but they're generally home by, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2006.294s">by</a>  midnight if ever, if we were to have a party like that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2009.855s">Earlier</a>  than a council meeting.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2011.755s">Yeah,</a>  so we're a family, we're basically a family restaurant and we're trying to answer the calling of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2021.117s">And</a>  at best in the summertime, we maybe go an extra half an hour on our patio than we do in the wintertime. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2028.179s">But</a>  I mean, it's even fewer hours when there's snow on the ground.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2032.708s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2033.228s">That's</a>  just how the community kind of breathes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2035.409s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2035.929s">Hey,</a>  you know, we'll see what we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2038.19s">These</a>  are the businesses we want to keep it met. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2039.95s">Oh,</a>  of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2040.93s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2041.29s">We'll</a>  see what we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2041.891s">Maybe</a>  we can get some of that to meet.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2043.651s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2240.263s">Do</a>  we have a petitioner from Pinky's Pizza? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2242.085s">You</a>  can come to the podium and we will hear from you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2247.99s">I</a>  am waiting for, just for clarification, I am waiting for the building department <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2254.378s">I</a>  tried to call today just to get an update with any reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2258.699s">So</a>  I'm probably going to ask the table this, or extend it to our next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2265.04s">But</a>  I did have questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2266.08s">I</a>  know that when we've had concerns of neighbors, I think that we see you've done everything that you need to do, and we want to support you in any way we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2279.623s">But</a>  you're going from one extreme to the next, and being to the point that <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2284.484s">it's</a>  in a residential neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2286.245s">And</a>  the biggest fear, we've received multiple emails with residents that love you guys, that think that you're great, hardworking people, but at the same time, it really affects their quality of life with not people that you have control of, it's with your customers or with the shared drivers that come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2304.793s">parking</a>  in front of people's homes, engines revving, music on, they run in and grab an order. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2309.595s">So</a>  they find it that it's gonna be a huge disservice for that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2312.796s">So</a>  I would tend to just offer that the timing to two o'clock in the morning, I wouldn't personally as one Councilor, especially in a residential area, I wouldn't really support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2329.643s">I</a>  think it's just too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2330.944s">But</a>  I will, like I said, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2335.074s">If</a>  we continue the meeting, then I'll make the motion that I'm still waiting to see if there's a way that we could figure something out with our building department, with our inspectors and our neighbors, to see if we can extend some hours to help you with your business, but at the same time, not affect the quality of life of that neighborhood.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2353.485s">So</a>  if you could give us your name and address and tell us, just give us a summary of your proposal.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2358.246s">So</a>  my name is Prabhjot Kaur. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2360.406s">The</a>  business address is 165 Main Street, Medford, and it's Pinky's Famous Pizza. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2367.107s">So</a>  we open till like 10 right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2370.508s">We</a>  didn't know, and in the community, there's only a couple of restaurants that open till late. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2376.169s">And</a>  usually pizza is something that, you know, when people get home late, that's when they wanna, you know, we're not doing too much business during the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2384.77s">In</a>  the evening, when it starts getting busy, we have to close. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2388.351s">And</a>  the latest because the open is still 11 right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2392.277s">So</a>  we were just thinking of, you know, how we can get more revenue and, you know, not be losing money. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2397.964s">At</a>  this point, and you know, this was just a thought we didn't know how it would go if the neighbors would agree or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2405.494s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2406.275s">It</a>  will be fine with whatever you guys can offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2409.217s">12</a>  or I don't know, maybe one, if not two. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2413.1s">This</a>  was the, I think, the most we could ask for. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2416.663s">So</a>  that's what we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2417.584s">There</a>  are some other that are open to like one and two. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2420.246s">So</a>  that's what just we went with. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2422.668s">But</a>  if we could do 12 or something, we will be fine with that too.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2426.178s">you.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2426.278s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2426.638s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2427.278s">If</a>  I can't do that now, we can go to questions from members of Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2430.24s">I'll</a>  go to Councilor start by the council.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2432.58s">If</a>  I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2433.061s">I</a>  just that I wear a body that really wants to try to support local businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2437.822s">So</a>  if we could find a way, maybe we can talk after the meeting that maybe we could, you know, reach out to a couple of those neighbors and maybe or if you can do some outreach, those neighbors that surround your your <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2452.984s">the</a>  reports that the emails that I received had nothing to do with how hard you work and how much they love your establishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2459.889s">The</a>  question is, they're just afraid of the outside people or activities that you have no control over. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2468.576s">And</a>  that's what they were questioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2469.496s">So</a>  that's why I don't wanna deny anything this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2472.299s">If</a>  we can just, I'd like to motion that we move this to our next meeting, just extend it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2478.263s">for</a>  two weeks and maybe... Given the time frame, I have to open the public hearing and then we can continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2482.304s">We</a>  can do that, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2483.185s">But</a>  I just want to give a petition, just what we're looking to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2486.886s">So</a>  maybe there's a way that we can talk to our neighbors and see if we can find something. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2492.387s">I</a>  think there's something here that we can work with the neighborhood, but I know what scared everybody was one o'clock and two o'clock every night.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2500.13s">It</a>  makes sense, yeah.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2500.85s">There's</a>  an old nurse, so thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2502.851s">Yes,</a>  two o'clock is definitely... I don't think there are many licenses in the city, maybe one or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2507.712s">1</a>  o'clock is a little more common, midnight more common than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2511.254s">So</a>  we do have to align with that as well as we discussed with the Oasis permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2515.957s">I</a>  will go to Councilor Leming for a question for the petitioner.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2520.26s">How</a>  much does business differ from Monday to Thursday versus the weekend, Friday, Saturday and Sunday? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2526.464s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2527.751s">like</a>  money wise?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2529.092s">Yeah,</a>  like how much to share your figures, but yeah, just yeah, just just ballpark, like how much more people you see on the weekends versus the weekdays.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2537.922s">It's</a>  a big difference weekdays, it's not that much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2541.806s">But</a>  weekends, especially like Friday and Saturday is when we do good business. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2547.171s">given</a>  like, you know, and then, or if we have long weekend, like games or something, then we'll do good on Sundays. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2552.576s">Otherwise</a>  it's just Friday and Saturdays when we actually get good revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2556.54s">Otherwise</a>  it's just like, not, I'm not going to say slow, but it's not as good as Friday and Saturday.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2563.506s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2564.146s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2564.427s">So</a>  the Friday and Saturday hours would be the ones that would help that business the most?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2568.53s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2568.771s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2569.351s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2570.512s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2570.873s">Any</a>  further questions for the petitioner?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2581.772s">Seeing</a>  none, I'm going to open the public hearing for anyone in favor, in opposition, or who would otherwise like to make a comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2587.615s">Public</a>  hearing is open. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2590.936s">Are</a>  you in favor of the petition?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2793.919s">Thank</a>  you, President Barras. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2795.12s">And</a>  I actually want to start with an apology because I didn't notice until just this moment that the, oh, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2801.003s">I</a>  didn't notice until just this moment that the first two pages of the annual surveillance report that I submitted are actually missing from our agenda packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2808.828s">They</a>  don't add anything particularly substantive, but what is included is just the surveillance report from the Medford Police Department and not the city council surveillance report that actually summarizes the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2820.935s">That's</a>  what our obligation is to submit at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2824.178s">It</a>  doesn't add anything substantive. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2825.621s">It</a>  tallies up the number of approvals and denials of surveillance technology that we did in the preceding calendar year, which in this report is zero. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2834.597s">That</a>  being said, I still don't <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2836.144s">feel</a>  comfortable putting forward a motion for my fellow councilors to vote upon, having not seen the document in its entirety. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2843.527s">So</a>  I would motion to table this until our next regular meeting, and I will make sure that those first two pages that contextualize the data are included on the agenda at that time.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2855.752s">On</a>  the motion to table by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Callahan, is this a table to a date certain of May 14th? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2863.295s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2866.717s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please follow.</p>

 <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2892.301s">be</a>  it resolved that the Medford City Council express its support of S. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2894.823s">1836</a>  and H. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2895.664s">2963,</a>  an act relative to the payment of the organizations exempt from property tax, be it further resolved that the City Clerk forward a copy of this resolution to the Medford Legislative Delegation as well as to the Chairs of the Joint Revenue Committee, Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2909.276s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2911.458s">So</a>  this is a motion to support the aforementioned bills that are currently in the State House. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2918.085s">I</a>  received outreach about this from several people that work with the Massachusetts Action for Pilot group. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2923.75s">This</a>  comprises workers and representatives of various social service and educational, et cetera, workers from across the state, all in support of this legislation, which kind of comes up year after year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2938.456s">The</a>  context for this is that currently in Massachusetts, large nonprofits that meet certain criteria are exempt from property tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2946.14s">We</a>  have several of those here in Medford, most notably Tufts, my alma mater. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2951.062s">As</a>  an alumnus of Tufts, I've always felt my particular responsibility to advocate for changing that rule so that cities such as ours can implement <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2961.198s">more</a>  fair, essentially compensation systems with these institutions that take up such a large footprint in our communities, but don't have to pay property taxes like everybody else does. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2973.39s">So</a>  this bill would enable a local option that communities can choose to adopt. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2978.203s">that</a>  would require that these large nonprofit organizations pay really only 25% of the tax obligation that they would otherwise have to submit if they weren't tax exempt. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2990.908s">So</a>  it's really, in my opinion, it's not even going as far as it should, but so many of our conversations behind this rail are talking about the various infrastructural projects and personnel and services <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3003.186s">that</a>  we ought to be able to provide to our residents that we can't because of a lack of funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3007.989s">So</a>  any action that this council can take to level the playing field, I think is a worthwhile one. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3013.493s">And</a>  I ask my fellow Councilors for their consideration in lobbying the state house to allow us to give us one more leverage when we're looking for fair compensation from these large, well-endowed institutions that we host in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3029.184s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3029.878s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Collins, and thank you for allowing me to co-sponsor this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3034.548s">I've</a>  been working on pilot since 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3037.013s">We</a>  had many meetings with Mayor Burke in 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3041.792s">The</a>  joint Our Revolution Medford, Our Revolution Somerville pilot working group released an estimate that if Tufts paid property taxes on its currently exempt properties, it would pay $8 million a year to the city, which is a significant amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3055.685s">One</a>  of the reasons that I've been working on this, and I worked with Representative Eiderhoven who filed this petition, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3064.455s">in</a>  2022 was on a panel, we did some interviews to try to get the word out there about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3072.821s">This</a>  would only go up to 25% and it would only be 25% of what they would otherwise pay if they were not exempt. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3080.546s">And</a>  it would also exempt any organization whose assets were less than $15 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3084.929s">So</a>  it's not trying to go towards small nonprofit organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3089.112s">It's</a>  really the large hospitals and educational institutions who do not pay their fair share right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3094.576s">So</a>  that would be $2 million more a year, and that was now five years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3098.042s">As</a>  everyone knows, property values have gone up by a couple billion dollars since then, so I'm sure it's a little bit more than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3105.208s">In</a>  any case, the reason that it does not advance in the Statehouse is that Tufts and Harvard and MIT and many others pay hundreds of thousands of dollars each every year to fund an organization called the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities of Massachusetts, and they lobby the Statehouse to kill this bill every session. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3122.954s">So</a>  that is something we can all call, all of our representatives are supportive of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3128.495s">I</a>  believe Representative Barbara Garbally <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3131.283s">I</a>  believe Representative Donato, I'd have to double check, and Senator Jalen, but this is an important thing, and as we all know, the state controls so much of what cities and towns are allowed to do, so that's why it's important that we advocate to the state to allow us to do more here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3149.829s">There</a>  is also something that this council has submitted regarding Tufts, which is a lesser bar, it's something called the Institutional Master Plan Home Rule Petition, currently under zoning, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3160.633s">We</a>  don't have nearly as much zoning authority over Tufts as we do over other private property exempt institutions, have exemptions through something called the Dover Amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3172.423s">We</a>  have asked that the State House give us the authority to require that Tufts tell us what they plan to do in terms of expansion and growth, a five-year master plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3180.31s">That</a>  also has not advanced for <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3182.692s">we've</a>  put it up every every session that I've been a city councilor that has also been quashed and we do that alongside Somerville as well who shares that concern so you know it really is the city working hard on this you know Tufts decided I think in 2021 <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3200.29s">that</a>  they were going to unilaterally implement. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3202.491s">They</a>  said, we'll give you a pilot of $450,000, and we're going to give $450,000 to Medford, $450,000 to Somerville, and $450,000 to Boston, and we don't really want to negotiate with you any more than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3214.774s">So</a>  it is not sufficient in my view, and that's why I'm supportive of state legislation to give our city more authority to hold Tufts to pay its fair share to our community for the services that it uses that are paid for by the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3231.331s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3232.651s">Councilor</a>  Tseng, and then Councilor Callaghan.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3235.412s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3236.372s">I</a>  think this has been really well described, so I'll be pretty brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3240.934s">Again,</a>  this is really asking big institutions like Tufts to pay their fair share in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3246.455s">You</a>  know, these institutions, they use our police, fire, medical services, they use infrastructure, water, sewer, and <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3255.598s">all</a>  we ask is for them to pay something a little closer to their fair share instead of $0. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3262.481s">The</a>  Massachusetts Municipal Association, which is a group that represents local governments from across the state, from across the Commonwealth, all 351 municipalities, this organization has asked <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3277.731s">local</a>  electives like all of us to send in letters of support to pass resolutions on the City Council to support this bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3285.796s">And</a>  they believe that doing so will be important at the State House. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3290.6s">And</a>  so I will very happily support this.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3296.524s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3300.532s">As</a>  a city, we are a cash-strapped city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3302.993s">There</a>  are many things, our water pipes, our roads, our schools, I could go on and on, that really require more funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3311.798s">Property</a>  taxes are one of the very few ways that we are able to raise any money, and it seems just not right to me that we ask every homeowner here to pay their property taxes without fail every year, and yet large organizations with billion-dollar <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3329.13s">endowments</a>  do not have to pay anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3332.492s">The</a>  25% number, as I understand it, was gotten to because that is approximately the amount of services that they use of the city that we do not get any reimbursement for. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3346.502s">I</a>  agree that 25% is not enough, but at least it is something, and I'm in favor.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3352.987s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3353.288s">Any</a>  further discussion?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3353.909s">Councilor</a>  Scarpello? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3354.75s">Thank</a>  you, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3355.512s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Cohn-Springsteen. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3358.397s">Now,</a>  this is creative. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3360.601s">This</a>  is raising money to support our housing issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3365.745s">through</a>  the people in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3367.386s">Isn't</a>  that great? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3370.848s">And</a>  I'm gonna support this 1000% because this is what we're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3377.732s">Because</a>  when we're talking with the last few weeks, last few months, the scary talk has really moved a lot of people in a negative way here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3385.397s">So</a>  when you hear resolutions like this, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3387.998s">you</a>  see what Cambridge has to do for, what Harvard has to do for Cambridge when it comes to housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3395.28s">You</a>  can see what Boston asked for housing with all their universities. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3399.5s">So</a>  this is something that I agree with my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3402.141s">I</a>  think we need to really, and especially as we see, I mean, they've, Tufts has just grown and growing and growing and <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3412.082s">And</a>  all we keep doing is losing revenue, losing tax revenue, providing more services, costing our community more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3419.045s">So</a>  I support this wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3420.945s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3421.726s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3423.706s">Any</a>  further discussion on the topic? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3425.487s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_29]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3432.009s">Louise</a>  D'Antonio, 41 Dartmouth Street, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3437.572s">It's</a>  nice to see that there's something that I agree with many of you on. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3442.415s">That's</a>  a move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3444.176s">I</a>  had a question and then a couple of comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3447.719s">Is</a>  the state legislature talking about separating classroom, space, taxing, and the residential properties that Tufts, the university's own, like the multifamilies? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3463.17s">Have</a>  they made that distinction or it would be on the entire acreage of footage of the university?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3471.644s">So</a>  my understanding of it is that it is about what properties qualify for exempt use under state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3478.329s">The</a>  dormitories actually qualify for exempt use right now because they are for educational purposes, the housing of students for educational purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3485.814s">That's</a>  the definition that applies currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3488.856s">My</a>  understanding is that at least the analysis and the legislation, if it were to move forward against the pay of the lobbyists, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3497.002s">is</a>  for all of the exempt purposes, and essentially the analysis that was done five years ago was asking the city assessor, what is the assessed value of all the land that is currently exempt from the property tax in the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3510.15s">And</a>  then you just apply the property tax rate to that amount to get the figure.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_29]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3513.852s">Thank</a>  you for answering that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3514.753s">My</a>  comment is, having lived in Medford most of my life and having taught at Medford High School, I can say that Tufts has never been a really good neighbor, not to the people that live where the students are housed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3530.884s">They</a>  have a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3533.925s">information</a>  that they could funnel through to the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3537.988s">They</a>  just don't seem to want to cooperate on on a day to day basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3543.751s">I</a>  mean, they have facilities up there that could be shared not every day, but they really haven't been what we'd call a good neighbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3552.497s">They</a>  haven't extended themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3554.418s">I</a>  think they offer <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3556.687s">two</a>  scholarships, and this, I may be corrected on this, two scholarships for Medford High School students, Somerville High School students, I don't know about Cambridge, but they're a bit stingy with their resources, and I'd like to see them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3573.666s">give</a>  us a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3574.727s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3575.867s">I</a>  just want to add on that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3577.528s">Part</a>  of the bill would also right now, tough says that they provide community benefits to the city, but of course, they don't quantify those benefits. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3584.852s">This</a>  bill would also allow us to require them to tell us if you if you want to provide the money in cash, you know, if we would like to provide the money in cash for your brother, but we're happy to take community benefits. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3594.296s">You</a>  just have to tell us what they're worth. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3595.977s">So</a>  that it meets the amount.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_29]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3597.078s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3597.318s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3598.078s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3599.799s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3602.793s">William</a>  Duval, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3605.675s">I</a>  actually like this bill as you do, but I wrote the author with one suggestion and it's one that you've heard before if you've been on the council for more than this term. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3618.824s">And</a>  that suggestion is that we continue to not tax the university's improvements, that's to say the buildings, but we don't give them any exemption at all on the land. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3628.17s">And</a>  that could either be the way the entire bill is structured, or it could be an option that the city council could adopt. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3635.593s">It</a>  wouldn't discourage buildings going up on the land at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3639.435s">They</a>  could build a dorm or an academic building, which we want to do to provide housing and jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3644.317s">However,</a>  it would much better discourage the university buying up additional land because the tax of the land would be much higher than it is under the proposed bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3654.032s">And</a>  I think it would actually wind up giving more revenue, but it would also encourage better behavior at the part of the university, and better align everyone's incentives. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3664.516s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3665.357s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3667.898s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3672.959s">Kelly</a>  Catala, 23 Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3675.58s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3676.961s">Thank</a>  you, because this- Please direct your comments to the chair.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3680.942s">Through</a>  the chair, can I talk to</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3682.682s">No,</a>  you can talk to me.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3684.403s">Okay,</a>  this will help housing, because the universities are part of your housing problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3690.708s">They</a>  overcharge for their housing, they don't have enough housing, then their students end up moving into the neighborhoods, then because they're coming from wealthy areas that are willing to pay much more than what the people in Medford can pay, that raises the rents there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3705.639s">Then</a>  they double up, they triple up, they quadruple up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3708.621s">If</a>  I look to the right side of the room, which I won't, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3711.283s">They</a>  all came to Medford because of universities. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3714.126s">They</a>  all came to Massachusetts because of universities. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3717.65s">They're</a>  coming here, they're staying here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3720.052s">It's</a>  increasing the population that is part of the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3723.356s">Not</a>  that we don't want you here, but it is part of the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3726.179s">So</a>  if the university is gonna benefit, and I do believe Tufts just raised their tuition to $90,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3732.165s">It's</a>  not about the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3733.466s">It's</a>  the fact that they're increasing the cost of housing just by being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3737.59s">Mayor</a>  Menino was able to do a lot with the universities in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3741.614s">Harvard</a>  went to the city of Cambridge and they came up with a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3745.598s">Cambridge</a>  is benefiting from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3747.28s">I'd</a>  like to see Medford benefit on the housing end too. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3750.002s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3750.863s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3751.284s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3752.48s">Harvard</a>  does have an exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3753.961s">Cambridge</a>  has an exemption for Harvard from some of the laws, which does help them access that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3758.682s">So</a>  that's one piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3760.303s">And</a>  I will also note that the state is losing population and the fastest loss of population is between 20 and 40.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3767.847s">When</a>  you look at the cost of housing and where the highest costs of being paid from, they're not from the people that have been here all their lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3775.093s">The</a>  people that have been here aren't being able to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3778.196s">People</a>  are coming in, they're getting wonderful degrees. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3780.918s">The</a>  companies are coming in to get the young graduates. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3783.84s">They're</a>  getting great jobs and they can afford to pay more than what most people are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3788.244s">Unfortunately,</a>  we have a lot of elderly people. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3790.746s">that</a>  need to go into housing, they're being told they need to wait five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3795.872s">There</a>  is a huge housing crisis, the university is a part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3798.775s">In</a>  regards to Harvard University, they went to the city of Cambridge with a plan back in 2000, which I don't have all the statistics right in front of me because I didn't plan on going there tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3808.525s">However,</a>  they helped the city of Cambridge produce and keep <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3814.11s">2600</a>  affordable units. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3816.912s">They</a>  don't give them money, they help leverage them the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3821.334s">That</a>  would be great if Tufts did that for Medford, that could help Medford, that would be a partnership. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3826.496s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3827.137s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3827.577s">Name</a>  and address for the record, actually I'm gonna go to Zoom, Maureen on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3831.839s">Maureen,</a>  name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3837.255s">Thank</a>  you, Zach and the rest of the board members. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3841.238s">I</a>  want to, first of all, touch on a couple of things that other residents brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3847.003s">First</a>  of all... Your name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3850.906s">Maureen</a>  Dunham, 55 Ellsworth Street, Medford, Mass.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3855.069s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3856.289s">So</a>  first of all, I want to touch base on what the former academic within the city mentioned, and that is the Stingy. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3869.137s">Two</a>  residents from Medford and two residents from Somerville that are one of thousands that apply for a full scholarship to Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3882.063s">When</a>  those candidates are not accepted, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3887.88s">We</a>  actually export them to other local state universities such as Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, my own son to Maryland, and we're losing a lot of the brightest bulbs. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3908.327s">Our</a>  own sons and daughters who are sons and daughters of <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3913.749s">City</a>  of Medford, two outside universities, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3920.132s">Number</a>  two, to touch on the infrastructure note that someone else made, I grew up in West Somerville on the grounds of Tufts University and have been a homeowner in Medford for the past 34 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3938.36s">Now,</a>  as I go back and forth, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3941.221s">I</a>  noticed that the roads in Medford, not so much in Somerville, are in very poor disrepair. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3950.891s">Yet,</a>  when I cross over Boston Avenue and go through the side streets that are Tufts University property, I note that <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3965.049s">Those</a>  streets are very well maintained. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3967.331s">And</a>  I know they're not maintained by the cities of Medford-Somerville because they've been bought and they're being used as non-for-profit housing, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3985.254s">university</a>  offices, et cetera, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3989.536s">So</a>  another reason why I wholeheartedly endorse this move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3997.499s">And</a>  secondly, I want to say that, oh, thirdly, I want to touch on the base that they use all of our emergency services and other services on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4010.217s">I</a>  have been going back and forth from Medford to Somerville, and on numerous occasions, I've seen students in housing, like three-family, two-family housing in Medford or in Somerville that are out on rooftops drinking and celebrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4033.064s">and</a>  having outdoor barbecues and fires. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4037.445s">And</a>  we all know where that leads to with the addition of a little bit of alcohol and immaturity. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4045.267s">So</a>  that's another reason why I wholeheartedly endorse support of this motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4053.209s">And</a>  that's all I have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4054.41s">Thank</a>  you very much for listening to me.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4055.85s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4057.23s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_28]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4059.531s">My</a>  name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4062.853s">Having</a>  served on this board some years ago, the city of Medford and Tufts University engaged in the pilot, a million dollar pilot program. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4070.599s">And</a>  the pilot program consisted of six students from Medford, six students from Somerville, who'd be able to go to Tufts University for nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4078.644s">The</a>  million dollar cash part of the program consisted of three years of getting cash up front with the remaining portions of the money to be used for <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4087.17s">I</a>  think there could have been fire or police equipment here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4091.334s">Now</a>  that hasn't been followed through since, for what reason, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4096.54s">But</a>  the idea of taxing up to 25% relative to the nonprofit, whether it's Tufts University or someone else, I guess you haven't hit the dollar mark yet of where you're gonna go. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4107.008s">But</a>  speaking with leaders up at the State House, the one thing that the City of Medford hasn't done, as other cities and towns done, you have not moved to provide an amendment to the CPA tax, which would include affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4120.793s">And</a>  as a result of that, and knowing that the Commonwealth now does not give back to the City of Medford from their surplus to the CPA, it's all going to be on cities and towns, excuse me, individually. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4134.938s">So</a>  I think the city of mid that has an opening over and beyond your 25% also to amend the CPA to now include affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4144.467s">You</a>  know, you give it to churches, you've given it to schools into swimming pools and open space and land. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4150.333s">This</a>  is a great opportunity right now for you as a council, first term especially, to move forward on your reps and on your senators to make this amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4159.44s">You're</a>  not getting rid of the CPA, you're amending it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4162.442s">And</a>  by amending it to put this inclusion in there, this will be your first step along with your 25% for the purpose of going forward to get your affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4171.489s">The</a>  other part of affordable housing is very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4175.672s">What</a>  has the city of Medford, can you folks, any one of you here, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4180.322s">give</a>  an accounting of how much money has been used for affordable housing, where has the location's been, where is the land, and where has the working relationship taken place between a private contractor coming in with the city of Medford to provide affordable housing along with regular housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4200.675s">I</a>  don't think you have a big inventory on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4202.617s">And</a>  I think if you keep talking about affordable housing, you keep talking about the transfer tax, you keep talking about the registry, I think you should start there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4211.023s">Because</a>  if there's nothing on the books right now, I think you need to get your feet wet in that particular area, get your base set up before you go into this next move. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4220.251s">25%</a>  sounds good. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4221.072s">I</a>  think you need an inventory of all the property in the city method that's tax exempt. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4225.035s">And</a>  I'm quite sure you'll find <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4226.696s">There</a>  are other pieces only on Tufts University where you can get that 25% from. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4231.419s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4233.701s">Just</a>  to answer some of the questions, I can give you an answer to some of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4237.943s">The</a>  only properties that were owned by nonprofits with assets over $15 million were Tufts University's many properties, as well as the former, what was Harvard Vanguard. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4249.631s">That</a>  was purchased by Atrius Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4251.55s">which</a>  is a for-profit corporation, and that money, that building is now taxed, the Atrius Health building here, but that was another organization that had over the threshold and was paying a pilot. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4262.156s">And</a>  additionally, the Rivers Edge development was part of the Brownfields Mississippi Valley Development Corporation, and that was paying a pilot and is now moving to the tax rolls. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4271.604s">So</a>  those are the major nonprofits that were paying pilots.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_28]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4275.327s">But</a>  a few years ago up in Beacon Hill, before the 25% came into play, there was a percentage ratio that went, like I believe Tufts University at the time had a $30 million endowment. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4285.695s">And</a>  there was a dollar amount that was set on the endowment that the school had. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4289.878s">as</a>  to what percentage it would go. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4291.841s">Now,</a>  Tufts doesn't have a large endowment. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4293.663s">It's</a>  not like Harvard University that's into the billions of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4297.368s">But</a>  there was a dollar amount, you may want to check this out once again, do your homework, go to Beacon Hill and find out what that legislation was. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4304.438s">Unfortunately,</a>  it didn't pass because as you said before, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4308.402s">Academy</a>  of colleges and universities. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4310.565s">But</a>  still, it's a stepping stone to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4313.369s">You</a>  know, and these are all pilot programs that you can look into, just because somebody is multi rich, like having I mean, Tufts University, you might find other locations where, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4326.28s">Listen,</a>  if you treat one one way, you got to treat them all the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4330.762s">And</a>  it might be better to have a universal thing rather than go to the 25% and just go for the biggest one. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4335.604s">Because</a>  if you can work on all of them, maybe in the long run, you'll be able to get more in the long run than just grappling at the first one.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4343.427s">I</a>  was very supportive of the endowment tax that you're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4346.728s">And</a>  in terms of the affordable housing piece, the planning department does have the city's subsidized affordable housing inventory, the SHI, which is a list of all of the affordable housing units in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4356.212s">And</a>  that's what we use to keep track of affordable units that are deed restricted, as well as making sure that we are meeting the <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4363.473s">safe</a>  harbor requirements for 40 B. So that is maintained by the planning.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_28]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4367.516s">But</a>  what you don't have right now in your inventory, you might have that, which I can vote, but you don't have the physical ground locations with new and additional affordable housing can go in and working toward that with getting this money, whether it's again, the 25% of the affordable housing of the CPA money, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4386.75s">Understood.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4387.171s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4387.811s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4389.492s">Councilor</a>  Leming.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4391.224s">and</a>  just to say a couple things about the CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4394.326s">So</a>  I'm not sure where the 25% number came from. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4398.388s">I</a>  believe on the CPA, the minimum is 10% for open spaces, historic preservation, and affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4405.291s">Now</a>  I understand that Cambridge requires 80% to go to affordable housing, but I believe that the reason that they do that is because they have money coming from other sources for historic preservation and open spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4418.977s">So</a>  their operating budget is about <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4420.858s">five</a>  times the size of Medford, they do have more money to throw around for, you know, building a playground or repairing a church or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4432.609s">So</a>  I think that the use of CPA money within Medford is a little bit different from the use of CPA money within other communities, especially Cambridge, which, again, has a lot more funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4443.939s">And</a>  the same really goes with Harvard and Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4446.801s">So</a>  Harvard's endowment, like you were saying, is above $50 billion. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4449.823s">Tufts</a>  is $2.4 billion. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4451.785s">So</a>  when we're talking about money here, it's like Cambridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4456.548s">And</a>  I do admire a lot of what Cambridge has done with affordable housing, but we're really talking about another order of magnitude in terms of funding.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4464.853s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4465.454s">We're</a>  going to go to Martha on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4467.055s">Martha,</a>  name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4472.051s">Yeah,</a>  hi, I'm Martha Andres. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4474.412s">I'm</a>  at 45 Kilgore Avenue in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4479.133s">Thank</a>  you for proposing this revisiting of the pilot payments that Tufts does. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4488.695s">I</a>  would encourage you, I've worked <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4491.701s">for</a>  MIT, Harvard, and Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4495.986s">And</a>  I know that they negotiate pretty hard on the community benefits. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4500.791s">But</a>  at the end of the day, if you are strong and creative, you will get community benefits out of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4513.101s">I</a>  would very much suggest that you base it, as a previous speaker said, not just on the police and fire and emergency services that they get from Medford, but on their impact on Medford as a community, on our housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4531.883s">our</a>  costs, and you ask them to be a real community partner to leverage what they can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4538.686s">They</a>  have not only money, but expertise, and they could do a lot more in Medford than they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4544.389s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4545.95s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4546.37s">I'm</a>  going to go to Mr. Castagnetti on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4550.252s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4554.814s">Yes,</a>  Andrew Castagnetti. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4557.842s">Cushing</a>  Street Methodist. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4559.343s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor, President Isaac Beers. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4563.005s">Can</a>  you hear me, sir? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4566.006s">You</a>  can hear me?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4567.227s">Isaac</a>  Bruce Beers II, if you want to go all the way.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4571.229s">Isaac</a>  B. Zach Beers. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4573.37s">Can</a>  you hear me, sir?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4574.751s">Yes,</a>  we can hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4575.471s">Go</a>  ahead, Mr. Castagnetti.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4577.072s">I</a>  could barely hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4580.814s">Being</a>  a Woodstock graduate, I'm all in and I'm for taxing these <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4587.017s">these</a>  nonprofits with their multi-billion dollar endowments, which supposedly they cannot touch, which to me is a bunch of malarkey. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4597.502s">On</a>  the other hand, have any of you Councilors heard of this entity called Walnut Hill Properties?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4606.026s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4608.347s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4609.508s">And</a>  can you basically tell us what it stands for and who owns it?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4614.366s">Walnut</a>  Hill Properties is the for-profit arm of Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4617.808s">They</a>  purchase properties, but they are taxed on those properties.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4622.75s">That's</a>  what I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4623.631s">I</a>  was at a meeting 20 years ago with Michael McGlynn, and I think he was <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4628.863s">He</a>  was the one that got this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4630.644s">This</a>  is an entity of Tufts College, and it forces them to when they buy real estate, one family's 10 families doesn't matter to buy it on the Walnut Hill properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4642.747s">So</a>  we don't lose that real estate tax on off the tax tools, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4649.329s">You</a>  know, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4652.821s">So</a>  I don't know how much more tax you're gonna be able to get out of them, you know, with your proposition.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4665.411s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Castagnetti. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4666.352s">Anything</a>  further?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4677.42s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Castagnetti. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4679.946s">go</a>  to Maureen D. on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4681.767s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4687.732s">Maureen</a>  Donovan, 55 Ellsworth Street, Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4691.995s">Just</a>  a couple of more points. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4693.896s">The</a>  first one being that to counter their argument that they provide services to the city, cultural, educational, et cetera, I want to point out that most of those services are <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4711.921s">are</a>  done by or accomplished by students, not the university itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4718.209s">They</a>  put out a program there and <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4723.476s">such</a>  as daycare services, or a fair, or an educational service to the students and community of Somerville and Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4734.365s">But</a>  the university doesn't really pay for the labor, because it's an expectation of the university that may be part of their culture that students give back. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4746.314s">And</a>  that's all free labor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4748.836s">I</a>  also want to note that, on a second note, that Tufts is like, I hate to use this word, a vulture. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4763.24s">And</a>  they are out there like vultures hovering over all the properties in the city of Somerville and Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4771.782s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4773.038s">What</a>  they do is they go to the owners of these properties and they offer them money beyond what they could get from private enterprise. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4783.162s">And</a>  so they sell. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4785.082s">And</a>  then in turn, what happens if Tufts sells a property, which I doubt they ever will, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4792.445s">they</a>  won't pay a tax to the city of Somerville or Medford for selling over a million dollar property. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4801.19s">And</a>  I think that's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4802.471s">You</a>  expect the residents, hard working residents to do it, but not these non for profits. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4809.755s">Oh,</a>  and one more thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4811.576s">I</a>  do notice that Mass General Brigham has a few <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4818.9s">outlier</a>  facilities within the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4823.425s">And</a>  we know from reading articles about the Boston Globe and from hearing it on other media that they just keep reaping in the benefits. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4837.621s">and</a>  turning it into their own agenda, such as developing their own health insurance, et cetera, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4844.804s">So</a>  I think this is a wonderful opportunity to make these billion dollar entities contribute to our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4855.488s">Thank</a>  you for listening to me.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4856.689s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4858.89s">Go</a>  to Roberta Cameron. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4859.93s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4869.255s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4869.716s">I</a>  appreciate this resolution and I appreciate all of the discussion that we've heard this evening about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4879.49s">The</a>  one small thing that I wanted to add to the discussion was that in considering the impact of the university, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4885.558s">I'm</a>  thinking not only of the services, the municipal services that they use, and the students who live in off-campus housing throughout the community, but even more so, I think about the staff and faculty of the university who also need housing in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4909.068s">and</a>  that providing sufficient affordable housing in any way that the university can contribute to that will really help to serve the university as much as it serves the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4921.353s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5128.017s">Hi,</a>  Teresa Dupont, 85 George P. Hassett in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5132.796s">Good</a>  evening, councillors. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5133.917s">I</a>  wanted to first thank you for the time to discuss this request of the Community Preservation Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5139.36s">I</a>  am joined by Roberta Cameron, chair of the committee, as well as Ryan Hayward, co-chair of the Medford Historical Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5147.945s">So</a>  as you briefed there before you as an appropriation request to fund the next phase of the Thomas Brooks Park restoration, I want to allow Ryan and Roberta to share their comments as well, but I'll take this opportunity <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5161.789s">To</a>  quickly share that this project has been a multi-phase project that has been previously recommended by the CPC, as well as funded by this honorable body. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5170.673s">Um,</a>  and some of the goals that have been identified in the phase, I personally think that will be really beneficial to the community as well as the residents of that immediate area, because it's going to bring some really nice amenities in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5187.035s">At</a>  this time, I guess I'll turn it over to Ryan if you wanted to give any further details on the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5196.087s">I</a>  don't want to steal your thunder.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_30]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5197.969s">No,</a>  I'll just be real quick to summarize and it's Ryan Heyward, 40 Sheridan Ave, Medford MA. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5206.459s">So</a>  this is a second phase of work for Thomas Brooks Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5211.903s">The</a>  first phase, of course, restoring the stone walls, Pompeii's wall, and conducting an archaeological dig. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5218.848s">This</a>  next round, we're going to try to go back and continue with the archaeological excavations to confirm some additional findings on that site. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5228.755s">We're</a>  going to be addressing the tree canopy and deadwood. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5234.399s">We're</a>  going to put up some signage on the park. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5237.202s">All</a>  of the openings that we made along the length of the park will receive curb cut adjustments, sidewalks, and striping to allow the pedestrians along the street to access the park. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5251.535s">And</a>  then there's a little bit of extra funding in there for contingency, knowing how construction projects work. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5255.719s">It's</a>  a little bit wild these days, and that accounts for the entire project.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5260.987s">Thank</a>  you, Ryan. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5261.607s">We</a>  also have the chair of the community preservation committee, Roberta Cameron. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5264.848s">Roberta,</a>  if you'd like to share anything additional.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5268.07s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5268.65s">I</a>  just want to thank the council for supporting this park in the past with previous funding for the restoration of the wall and the design. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5278.613s">And</a>  I'm looking forward to seeing the implementation of the design in this space.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5284.636s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5285.176s">Any</a>  questions by members of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5286.576s">Council</a>  Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5420.297s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5422.452s">First</a>  of all, the council president and I did speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5426.113s">Moving</a>  forward, I think that coming to professional opinions that putting in vague resolutions where it comes to discussion, we're going to try to make them more substantive. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5439.756s">I</a>  think that whenever we do a subcommittee meeting or a regular meeting and we put resolutions in that are open-ended, I can understand that it's a little confusing, and I think that we can work on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5452.24s">with</a>  this process, I think that understanding, it first started with the process with subcommittee that Councilor Leming proposed that with the newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5465.21s">I</a>  think that understanding the process where it starts <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5469.574s">here</a>  and to a subcommittee and the subcommittee is the process is then sent to the council floor that we vote on something as a council to support or not support or share openly to the public of any concerns that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5484.377s">Has</a>  something changed since then?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5486.458s">The</a>  council could of course authorize a committee to take action if it wanted to do so, but generally final disposition should occur on the council floor.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5493.982s">Okay,</a>  so, and this is so people understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5497.323s">I've</a>  gotten phone calls and they said, we don't see your names represented on this newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5504.206s">And</a>  the issues I said that, well, I'm not, because I think that I had some concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5509.248s">And</a>  the concerns I had was not the fact that we're getting more information out to the community, but making sure that everybody, that there's equity involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5519.552s">And</a>  we asked for some answers to the communications director, and he gave us some responses that really didn't equate to much, but still we have still yet vetted how we're getting the have-nots, the people that don't have an avenue to get our information. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5538.442s">And</a>  where is our information going? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5540.993s">it's</a>  going to the same people, the haves in our community, and they're getting the information that's designed by six members of this council, that I would question whether there is some violations. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5552.856s">And</a>  I would ask legal counsel to report back to us if this is in violation of, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5562.281s">campaigning.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5563.542s">And</a>  I think because we have six members that are on a slate that are putting out a newsletter that's going directly to an identified group of people that really isn't hitting the whole community.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5575.331s">It's</a>  going to the same list that all city communications go through.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5579.214s">Sure,</a>  and I appreciate your opinion, but I think there's some issues that I really want a legal opinion on.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5585.139s">By</a>  your logic, the mayor's communications would also be campaigning.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5588.041s">So</a>  we should ask that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5590.243s">So</a>  the key is really just asking these questions and having a set of solicitor, this wouldn't even have been a resolution, just a phone call and say, hey, I have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5598.869s">But</a>  because we don't do that, I have to bring this forth on the council floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5602.291s">So</a>  I mean, that would be one. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5604.153s">The</a>  second, which is more, that's really affected this community more than I think my colleagues even thought they could. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5613.86s">Because</a>  over this past week, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5616.715s">there</a>  was communication that was signed by my president and my vice president to state delegates about the transfer tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5628.94s">And</a>  it's gone rampant that my fellow colleagues used their titles on a topic that we wanted to send to subcommittee that we have yet to talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5646.155s">The</a>  communication, the lack of communication, and the lack of putting forth this process of going towards subcommittee, it's something that we found so important to this community that hundreds of people were involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5658.982s">And</a>  the feedback we got back from real people that have been here for years, that actually put this community on the map. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5669.028s">I</a>  want you to understand, I get phone calls from people that told me, George, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5673.709s">if</a>  no one's gonna listen to us, and there isn't gonna be the option that Councilor Callahan, they stress, put forth saying, this is just an opportunity to bring this to subcommittee to see what works and what doesn't, to see if we needed, if this is going to, and how we can focus and who we look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5690.62s">Are</a>  we looking at developers? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5691.661s">Are</a>  we looking at homeowners? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5692.762s">Are</a>  we looking at seniors? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5693.802s">Are</a>  we looking at so on and so forth? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5696.384s">But</a>  we didn't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5698.058s">So</a>  these members of the community legitimately called me, and this isn't a political ploy or anything, I'm just sharing something. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5705.823s">Good</a>  Medford people, backbone to this community, that said they decided that something what you think is sort of a political victory has now forced them to move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5722.254s">And</a>  that to me is damaging to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5726.036s">It's</a>  still dividing our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5728.527s">Now,</a>  don't get me wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5730.609s">Everybody</a>  knows this is the political process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5734.272s">Six</a>  members of this community, this body, ran on a slate, were elected, and they have the decision in the final vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5743.2s">Everybody</a>  has to understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5744.841s">So</a>  if people come up and wanna be angry and disrespectful and talk negatively and be angry, that's too bad, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5752.568s">They</a>  didn't do what they had to do in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5755.711s">But</a>  what I want you to understand, that these are real issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5759.612s">These</a>  are real issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5760.432s">And</a>  this is what, it's only a 2% tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5762.753s">I</a>  hear that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5763.813s">It's</a>  only this, but we heard it today. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5765.754s">We</a>  heard it this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5767.494s">Between</a>  the $3 to $6 million focus on getting our roads back to snuff, $3 to $6 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5774.396s">We're</a>  talking about a $250 million new high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5781.823s">right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5782.243s">We're</a>  talking about a rent control. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5784.464s">We</a>  talked about a 2% transfer tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5789.707s">We're</a>  talking about an override. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5793.048s">We're</a>  talking about a CPA that the state isn't matching. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5798.11s">And</a>  from what we see is really, they're not doing their share for affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5805.274s">So</a>  with all this, it's not just 2%. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5808.871s">And</a>  what that letter says, it's pretty damaging. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5811.813s">I</a>  don't know if you really thought it out when you signed this on.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5814.175s">And</a>  that's- I signed the same letter in 2020.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5816.437s">That'll</a>  bring me to the point where I'll ask for, through the clerk, I'll ask for a legal opinion that using city council titles and the correspondence to the state or other entities that gives the impression the information is offered as an official act of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5833.53s">It</a>  specifically didn't, if you read the letter- Well, if that's something that, I'm cliche for you, but you're not my attorney.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5837.813s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, if you read the letter, there's a section that says signed on behalf of the board, and then there's a section that says signed on behalf of the individual. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5845.141s">Our</a>  names were included in the section that said signed on behalf of the individual.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5847.483s">So</a>  let me ask the question that we can, Mr. Clerk, through the chair, to ask legal representation if, by using it, no matter what line you put it in, but using your title <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5860.456s">By</a>  using your title, does that constitute what I asked? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5865.0s">And</a>  if you'd like me to send that to you, I will. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5866.861s">But</a>  I, Council President, I respect you, but you're not the legal entity of this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5872.465s">So</a>  I want that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5873.266s">Is</a>  that a motion to amend the paper?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5875.568s">I</a>  wouldn't, if we could, I'd like to make that as a motion that we ask for the legal opinion on that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5884.538s">So</a>  there's a motion on the floor by Councilor Scarpelli to amend the paper to request a legal opinion on whether city communications are campaign communications and whether the use of city title, the use of titles by city officials, could you, what the use of the titles?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5903.025s">So</a>  city council titles using correspondence to state or other entities, it gives the impression <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5909.929s">that</a>  the information is offered as an official act of the City Council.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5915.213s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5915.674s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5916.254s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5916.774s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5917.295s">I</a>  just want to do want to clarify that that letter did not do that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5919.837s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5920.117s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5920.457s">But</a>  what I'm saying is you whatever line you put it in individually or not, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5927.549s">It's</a>  it just doesn't it's it's it doesn't pass the smell test when you sit here and talk to hundreds of people and you express that this is a process that we want to vet it is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5939.774s">And</a>  then we put out and what they what was what was said in that letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5944.315s">was</a>  so damaging that it truly affected neighbors and residents that it's going to affect more than just the 2%, more than what was said, maybe 1% here, 1% there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5957.265s">The</a>  talk was 5%, and who would pay for it, and then so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5963.169s">So</a>  there's a magnitude of issues on that letter that I think that as a body to even sign that, individually or not, it just gives out <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5974.127s">the</a>  look that this body truly doesn't want to listen to the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5978.568s">I</a>  just want to clarify, what did the letter say? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5981.029s">We</a>  can read it if you like. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5982.829s">I'll</a>  send you a copy of it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5984.09s">Okay,</a>  I just wanted to see, because the letter that I signed, which I also signed four years ago, and I'm going to go to Councilor, Vice President Collins, then Councilor Collins, and then Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5994.744s">I</a>  signed one four years ago, I testified actually in public in favor of the transfer fee February 2020 at the State House, signed the same letter, is requesting the authority to give cities and towns the power to make the decision for themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6008.099s">So</a>  that's what the letter said, and I'm gonna go to Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6010.943s">So</a>  I'm not done yet, I haven't stopped, I'm still continuing to speak.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6014.947s">Oh,</a>  you're not done.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6015.507s">Yeah,</a>  no, I'm not done. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6016.188s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6016.488s">No,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6017.348s">So</a>  the other issue is that we're talking about, you know, the these communities that are involved in this tenure and this in this transfer tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6026.332s">And</a>  it's surprising to see that these communities and I've reached out to local members of of council and elected bodies in these communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6036.096s">And</a>  I find it amazing that for the most part, most of these communities that have that have signed on to this are <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6043.619s">vacation</a>  communities, communities that have housing for summer rentals. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6049.501s">You</a>  have a few that you have conquered, possibly Somerville, Arlington, Cambridge, but then the rest are West Tinsbury, Wellfleet, Truro, Tisbury, Provincetown, Oaks Bluff, Nantucket, Edgartown, Amherst, Boston, Brookline, that's Chatham, Chilmark, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6073.803s">These</a>  are towns that, for the most part, when you say that these towns, there are 17 cities and towns that are supporting this, you're sending out the wrong message. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6083.53s">Because</a>  the reason those communities are out there is because of the development that goes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6088.814s">Now,</a>  if this council truly said, let's focus on a transfer tax on developers for these properties, it'd be important to discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6097.961s">But</a>  with that letter that was just signed on, whether it was two years ago, it was done again this week, that it sends the wrong message. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6106.129s">So</a>  again, and I'll finish with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6110.273s">When</a>  you look at what is being asked for and what has been discussed by this council over the last two months, and the monies that you're asking for, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6121.161s">you're</a>  scaring homeowners, homeowners that I think that I don't think you truly understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6127.923s">A</a>  million dollars isn't a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6132.144s">You</a>  raise your eyebrows, but a million dollars for a homeowner in this community isn't isn't a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6138.886s">And</a>  for the people that built these homes to a million dollars, they're hard working blue collar workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6145.467s">Can</a>  you take that off the camera, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6147.878s">You're</a>  talking about homeowners that built for nothing and using their homes for retirement for the most part, at least for the 300 phone calls and emails that I've received. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6159.641s">Now,</a>  again, this is my opinion as a city councilor moving forward when we get it to subcommittees that we really spell things out so we understand the processes <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6171.038s">And</a>  we're not misleading community members that we're going to wait for the subcommittee that was so intense that we haven't had a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6178.403s">We</a>  haven't had a meeting, but then my two fellow leaders, my council leadership here can sign off. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6184.748s">And</a>  what I think is a violation using the title, but we'll wait for legal opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6190.032s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6191.325s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6192.066s">And</a>  I would note that many Councilors have signed many letters over many years advocating for the things that they care about and always have something to say on an issue.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6200.516s">You</a>  have a lot to say really not from the chair, my friend.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6203.179s">Yeah,</a>  you really violations are sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6207.273s">Violations</a>  are the violations of telling the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6209.833s">So</a>  is that what the truth is? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6211.694s">Yes,</a>  I'm my obligation as the chair is to state facts.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6214.434s">You</a>  don't say facts.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6216.815s">And</a>  I'm incredibly disappointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6218.715s">I'm</a>  disappointed that there are people who would miss our neighbors so that they feel like they need to move. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6224.556s">I</a>  think that's shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6225.256s">I'm</a>  disappointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6226.016s">Vice</a>  President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6226.877s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6229.257s">You're</a>  not following your rules.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6234.258s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6236.311s">I</a>  think we should take the temperature down. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6237.995s">Just</a>  going to pause for a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6241.704s">Let's</a>  take the temperature down. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6245.655s">I'll</a>  start through the chair to Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6247.976s">I</a>  appreciate you're bringing up the process for the newsletter coming out of the resident services and public engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6255.078s">Obviously</a>  this is our, that committee of which I am not a part is just piloting this process going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6261.159s">I</a>  agree it would also be more comfortable if that was brought to the floor and disposed of from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6266.701s">I</a>  think that's a great note for going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6271.846s">this</a>  is a resolution about discussing the city council subcommittee process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6276.189s">And</a>  I just want to note that I don't really think it's in the service of giving people proper notice to weigh in on an issue that they care about, or transparency for us to be re-litigating a topic that is in committee, the committee that I chair, under a paper for which it was not brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6294.422s">So</a>  I don't think that- I'm sorry, I didn't understand that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6297.585s">Yeah,</a>  any comments on the transfer fee are out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6299.886s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6301.715s">I'm</a>  going to finish my point. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6302.676s">I</a>  don't think that we should let this turn into relitigating the transfer fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6306.3s">We</a>  are going to talk about that in committee so that residents and Councilors can be properly noticed about when the substance of that discussion is going to occur and come prepared, having thought about it and speaking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6319.584s">Through</a>  the chair to Councilor Scarpelli, I hope you know that I sincerely respect you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6323.608s">I've</a>  always enjoyed working with you, and I respect you enough to want to correct the record when things are being said that I think are a bad faith attack on my character. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6331.296s">I</a>  think that anybody who's willing to engage in this in good faith knows that there is a difference between me <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6336.341s">as</a>  an individual, using my name and my title to speak as an individual, using my petition, signing a letter in support of something, being crystal clear, it's me as an individual endorsing something. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6348.685s">I</a>  do that all of the time, on many platforms, on letters, on social media, and individual phone calls with various administrations saying I'm speaking as myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6359.248s">Every</a>  councillor here <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6361.556s">Every</a>  Councilor here has the opportunity to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6364.918s">Some</a>  exercise it more than others. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6367.32s">Everybody</a>  in any role has an opportunity to say that, to say, this is the experience that I'm speaking from. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6371.062s">I'm</a>  not speaking for my constituency, necessarily, when I'm signing a letter saying, I endorse this as a public official. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6377.787s">This</a>  is concurrent with our public process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6379.528s">We</a>  are going to have publicly noticed committee meetings about the real estate transfer fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6384.872s">At</a>  the same time, just like everybody here, I retain the right to say, I as an individual endorse that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6392.336s">I</a>  also want to bring up, well, there's a lot to say about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6400.218s">I</a>  think it's really regrettable that there has been so much consternation about, you know, this is a polarizing issue, and I get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6410.201s">And</a>  maybe that's not even worth regretting, because polarizing issues are always going to be polarizing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6414.442s">And</a>  it's how we move on from that that's really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6420.453s">I</a>  really take umbrage with the assertion that having some people in office who are supportive of one thing and other people also in office and also out of office who don't agree and going through that process of friction and tension and talking about it and arguing about it in public session <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6440.874s">I</a>  disagree that that's harmful. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6442.635s">And</a>  I take umbrage with the fact that being in support of something that doesn't have consensus is harming this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6449.878s">We</a>  are going to talk about this in public session, as we have been doing, until it gets to the time we're going to put it to a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6455.881s">And</a>  when we put it to a vote, I want to remind everybody, what we put to a vote is simply asking the state for the authority to again meet in public session to deliberate on what we should do as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6470.342s">I</a>  don't believe that perception is reality, actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6473.124s">And</a>  I think that when people are telling us how something should make us feel, we should follow the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6480.929s">And</a>  I hope that, I know we're gonna continue to talk about these issues in committee, these polarizing issues, these issues that leave many of us feeling extremely passionate. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6494.974s">but</a>  I think we should all come with our own opinions and a mutual respect and an unwillingness to believe that anybody in the room is out to get the other person. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6503.778s">And</a>  whoever's telling you that somebody in the room is out to get the other person, they're probably wrong, because we all live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6509.961s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6512.302s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6513.222s">Councilor</a>  Callahan, Councilor Lazzaro, Vice President, sorry, Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6518.025s">Councilor</a>  Callahan first. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6522.327s">I</a>  believe I did it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6525.581s">Okay,</a>  councillors are.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6530.949s">I</a>  had raised my hand earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6531.949s">It</a>  doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6533.89s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, I appreciate you mentioning something about the Resident Services Committee, that you had voiced the same concerns during that meeting, but then you had left the Zoom and didn't hear our responses, but I had offered to bring that paper to the regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6553.576s">It</a>  did not get a second, and it didn't get voted to come to the regular meeting, so it didn't pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6558.337s">Um,</a>  I also offered to, uh, speak with our director of diversity, equity and inclusion, which did that motion did pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6567.208s">And</a>  I spoke with her today about ways that we can best, um, take advantage of <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6574.798s">her</a>  and her expertise and our affinity groups and our different opportunities in the city to make sure that we're taking advantage of all the resources that we have at our disposal to make sure that the newsletter is reaching our residents to the best of our abilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6595.458s">A</a>  few things that she mentioned were <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6600.583s">I</a>  understand the intention of the newsletters to be emailed, but also that we could have paper copies and we can bring them to events. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6608.812s">Maybe</a>  we can distribute them along with the listening sessions once those are off the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6613.234s">Um,</a>  and then, um, something director noise I mentioned is, uh, bringing bringing paper copies to things like the Haitian flag ceremony that's coming up May 18th and meeting communities where they already are instead of requesting that folks come to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6630.105s">Um</a>  so that's something that we discussed, but I would intend to <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6641.189s">But</a>  I would also reiterate what Vice President Collins says and hope that we can keep our comments on this to what's on the agenda.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6650.616s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6655.72s">I</a>  have to say, I am trying to understand how we can be discussing the transfer fee when it is not on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6667.438s">And</a>  I implore the chair to limit discussion to what is on the agenda, because people need to be noticed publicly so that everyone knows what is on the agenda and what we are discussing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6682.129s">This</a>  can't be a body where you put something completely vague on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6686.753s">And</a>  I have to say, when I read this, I had no idea what was going to be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6695.925s">We</a>  have to know, and the public needs to know, what is on the agenda, so that people who are interested in talking about that topic can come.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6704.187s">Yes,</a>  I spoke with Councilor Scarpelli about that, and I believe we are amending this to have some substance, but in the future, if there are motions to discuss in a vague way, I probably will rule them out of order.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6718.451s">Second,</a>  I would like to say <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6737.603s">back</a>  to me.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6741.206s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6742.246s">I</a>  would like to emphasize the point that there was a motion that Councilor Tseng was absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6747.03s">He</a>  was on vacation at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6749.251s">So</a>  there are four people of the five committee members of the most recent Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee Councilors Scarpelli through the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6756.517s">You</a>  let your objections to the newsletter be known, which were you consistently let everybody on this body note since we've been discussing the newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6764.662s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6765.603s">But</a>  then at 8 34 PM, you then left the meeting without notifying anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6771.148s">And</a>  because of that, like I was chair, so I didn't think it was appropriate to second motion from the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6777.494s">And</a>  obviously, Councilor Callahan disagreed with the motion to send it to the regular, um, to the floor because there was the opinion that the perfect cannot, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6790.51s">be</a>  good, can't be the enemy of the perfect, whichever way that goes, and that we needed to get a newsletter out in a timely way. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6797.213s">If</a>  you had decided to stay at the meeting and attend these meetings consistently, we would be debating this at the floor.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6802.596s">Councilor,</a>  if you could just share your comments with the chair.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6804.737s">Apologies.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6806.258s">If</a>  Councilor Scriabelli had decided to stay at the meeting and hear the rest of the discussion, then we would be voting on the newsletter on the floor right now, and I hope that in the future, resident services and public engagement committees <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6817.827s">We</a>  can do that second. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6819.369s">I</a>  know that it just in response to some of the discussion about public fear and outrage in response to some of these, I would like to point out that a lot of the more recent <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6834.468s">concerns</a>  and emails that we've been seeing were the result of a text sent around to many other, to most residents in the city, or a huge number of them from the Greater Boston Real Estate Board, which has obviously consistently opposed these measures in other cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6848.619s">So</a>  I think that that should be noted. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6853.743s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6854.163s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6854.683s">Mr.</a>  President, if I can.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6856.725s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6858.206s">Directly,</a>  he used my name, so I would point of personal privilege.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6861.752s">I'd</a>  like to go to Councilor Callahan, if I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6867.596s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6871.139s">I</a>  wanted to just make a comment that it seems that people do misunderstand the subcommittee process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6878.405s">So,</a>  since this is what is on the agenda, I would like to discuss the subcommittee process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6884.729s">That</a>  is, that when we are going to begin to discuss <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6890.382s">some</a>  piece of legislation, for example, that before we can come in with all the wording ready, set, go, we have to give it a paper number. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6902.486s">So</a>  we bring it to this body for it to get a paper number so that it can be discussed in committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6910.789s">That</a>  is the way that we do things. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6913.53s">And</a>  then it will be discussed in committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6915.311s">Committees</a>  are open to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6917.191s">They</a>  are held right here in this room. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6919.753s">any</a>  member of the public may come, they may be part just as in city council meetings, they can be part of the discussion where we craft the language together as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6932.517s">That</a>  may take one committee meeting, it may take more than one committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6939.439s">It</a>  will then, especially if it is an ordinance or some larger piece, it will be required to have three hearings, three readings. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6951.693s">here</a>  at the city council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6956.215s">So</a>  I am somewhat confused as to why what was said that was my description that this was the beginning of a process is being questioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6967.84s">It</a>  is definitely the beginning of a, this is what subcommittee, subcommittee, but committee process is about. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6974.863s">You</a>  get a paper number, it goes to committee, it gets discussed openly, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6978.644s">with</a>  the public in committee, that is where language can be drafted, and then it comes to this body, and there are still public hearings in this body.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6989.916s">Yes,</a>  every item discussed by the City Council is discussed in multiple public meetings with the participation of the public.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6995.983s">So</a>  I thank Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6998.817s">Point</a>  taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7000.098s">Thank</a>  you for answering my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7001.88s">The</a>  question I had was the process subcommittee for the newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7006.825s">It</a>  got its number. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7007.926s">It</a>  was vetted. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7009.387s">It</a>  comes to then the body that we vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7012.109s">And</a>  then once it's agreed with the community, a newsletter is then released, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7017.13s">That's</a>  the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7018.211s">Was</a>  the process followed, Councilor?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7019.932s">It</a>  was not. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7020.512s">It</a>  was not.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7021.393s">So</a>  I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7023.194s">And</a>  this is what the conversation was. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7025.915s">And</a>  for what I left, I think I've been very vocal in understanding I do the best I can on Wednesday nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7033.5s">I've</a>  expressed that to the president. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7035.741s">I</a>  do have another job. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7037.242s">As</a>  a matter of fact, I have two other jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7039.063s">And</a>  I do the best I can to stay to every meet at Council Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7043.185s">But</a>  on Wednesday nights, as Councilor Bears can attest, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7046.437s">I</a>  do the best I can to stay as long as I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7050.08s">And</a>  to point me out that I left at a certain time, I gave my opinion, and then I had to go close the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7059.166s">So</a>  to that point, I've asked the council president to please look for other evenings other than Wednesday nights, so I can stay at all the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7069.413s">Also,</a>  I don't have to miss a meeting, because I missed one. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7072.455s">I</a>  missed the one prior to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7075.06s">And</a>  then I stayed as long as I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7078.003s">And</a>  I appreciate the discussion that happened after that, but that's common practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7084.43s">That</a>  happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7085.27s">You've</a>  missed meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7086.852s">We've</a>  missed meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7087.673s">We've</a>  left meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7090.916s">The</a>  process I bring this forward on your situation and your resolution is that what Councilor Callahan said is what is an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7099.2s">A</a>  subcommittee gets a number, we discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7102.762s">Long</a>  as it takes, we make a vote to send this to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7106.844s">To</a>  the council, we then vote and then we act. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7110.285s">You</a>  didn't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7114.531s">You</a>  didn't do that, Councilor Bears, through the Chair, to Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7117.353s">You</a>  didn't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7118.414s">So</a>  I appreciate that bringing forward, because it's true, that's what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7121.697s">And</a>  then to Councilor Collins, through the Chair, to be vague and to be deceiving, not my intention, didn't know how to bring this forward, no different than her first meeting, Councilor Bears, through the Chair, when we talked about, quote unquote, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7142.489s">The</a>  description of our subcommittee was on what? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7145.837s">Home</a>  rule petitions, very vague.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7148.567s">I</a>  can read the full text of that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7149.848s">Very</a>  vague home rule petition.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7151.389s">So</a>  when we saw that, if I could read the full text.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7154.691s">Wait,</a>  can I interject really quickly?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7156.231s">No,</a>  hold on a minute.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7156.932s">No,</a>  Councilor Scarpelli, I didn't mean that you were being deceitful. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7159.493s">Yeah,</a>  well, I can read the full text.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7162.455s">The</a>  February 14th Planning and Permitting Committee meeting, <a href="../resolutions/22-310.pdf"><font color="green">22-310</font></a>, housing home rule petitions offered by Vice President Bears and Councilor Collins, whereas the city of Medford and greater Boston region are in the midst of a deep housing crisis that is displacing residents and families. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7176.403s">and</a>  whereas the City of Medford saw a 15% year-over-year increase in average rents from March 2021 to March 2022, and a 5% increase in average rents from February 22 to March 2022, according to WGBH News, and whereas many Medford residents are facing significant rent increase or other methods of displacement from rental units, now, therefore, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the Housing Subcommittee meet to discuss the potential drafting of home rule petitions on the following policies to protect Medford residents facing housing instability, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7203.346s">and</a>  a lack of affordable housing options, bullet point rent stabilization, tenant right to purchase, tenant right to counsel, just cause eviction protections, regulation of upfront lease fees, anti-price housing protections, and exemptions for small owner-occupant landlords. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7217.537s">Be</a>  it further resolved that the housing subcommittee discuss a potential council resolution supporting H1378 and S886, an act enabling local options for tenant protections currently under consideration by the Massachusetts legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7228.686s">So</a>  it was a pretty specific notice.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7230.976s">So</a>  when we talk about these concerns and issues, when we talk about subcommittees, and we talk about subcommittees that are in session that we're not talking about, and they're not being they're not being brought forth yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7244.965s">When</a>  the community sees a concern, and they bring it forth to me, and <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7254.639s">that</a>  they're nervous for the fact that the process that they thought was mentioned that evening wasn't followed through. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7265.787s">I</a>  looked at this as a process to speak on it so they understood the process as we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7273.092s">So</a>  as we move forward with the subcommittee process on the transfer tax, understand what phone calls I got, the emails I got, the people that talked to me on the street, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7284.807s">So</a>  this is done. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7285.647s">I</a>  said, what is done? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7286.987s">No,</a>  it's not done. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7288.388s">Well,</a>  this letter says everything that we fear about, everything that we were nervous about that evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7296.569s">So</a>  to one councilor's point of view, as this being dividing and this is being hurtful, you have hundreds of people that felt that night that they weren't listened to. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7308.771s">And</a>  then with the delay and not talking about an issue that was a pretty hot topic, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7314.383s">and</a>  then not being brought forth and then this letter going out publicly, it put people in a different way. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7324.229s">So</a>  it's my responsibility as a council to try to put this forward so we can discuss it, so we can move forward with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7331.194s">So</a>  if at any time <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7334.619s">that</a>  you say something to me that's hurtful, and I say something to you that's hurtful, we know each other personally to understand that I know you have a job to do, and you're representing people that have come to you directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7345.95s">That's</a>  all I'm doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7349.273s">And</a>  I'm telling you, it is scary to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7354.434s">It's</a>  scary to people that when I, it's not that it is scary people to the point that they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7360.256s">And</a>  that's what I just, you need to share that as part of this lack of subcommittee process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7365.658s">So</a>  again, appreciate our talk earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7368.439s">I'll</a>  make sure moving forward as we move forward with these, our resolutions that I will eliminate discussion and I'll be more detailed for the body. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7378.663s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7379.023s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7383.749s">I</a>  just wanted to say really quickly two quick things. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7387.031s">I</a>  think my name was invoked earlier on to correct the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7393.014s">I</a>  have been trying to make this meeting and the last meeting in person, but I've not been able to because of some academic and professional commitments. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7405.402s">I</a>  was away for a weekend, but that didn't affect this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7411.225s">I</a>  think in general, it seems like this discussion is getting a little out of hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7415.868s">I</a>  think there are good questions being raised about how we can better communicate how the city council works in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7423.533s">But</a>  I think I have to be very honest in saying that before I ran for office and when I was just the viewer of these meetings, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7432.159s">that</a>  city council, how it worked, I also was confused by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7435.742s">And</a>  I think we need to just do better in general at communicating how we work, regardless of how subcommittees work, of how the general council works. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7446.149s">And</a>  so I think in the future, we need to create some short guide or some short document, some diagram showing people how these processes work.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7460.063s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Leming, Councilor Callahan.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7463.104s">I'd</a>  also just like to point out a few things about the process, since this is a resolution to discuss City Council subcommittee processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7470.665s">So</a>  what we're doing in the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee is we have a continuing resolution, which is a resolution to innovate in the City Council's communication processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7486.168s">And</a>  so that basically means that we come up with <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7489.029s">a</a>  number of ideas, one of which is the newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7491.53s">And</a>  so in earlier committee meetings, we had motioned and agreed to, as a committee, come up with a schedule by which people draft the newsletter, and then every month have a different city councilor, not necessarily somebody on the committee, if they want to volunteer and have the time to put forward a draft of the newsletter, which would then be edited at a committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7512.424s">So</a>  if there are concerns, I mean, I think that the, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7518.608s">Vagueness</a>  of resolutions or the specificity with which individual papers say that we're going to, you know, do X, Y or Z in committee is a continuing concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7529.118s">Obviously,</a>  that's been a concern with this with this very agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7533.562s">But</a>  if it does make, I mean, we obviously can bring forth a another. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7540.669s">resolution</a>  that more specifically states that we're going to put out a newsletter every month via committee for consideration at the regular meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7550.738s">It's</a>  just that with communications it is necessary to be timely and get something out there every month because events happen every month and we need to be consistent in our communications and <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7565.191s">we</a>  get criticized for being intransparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7568.412s">And</a>  the newsletter is a way to address that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7571.393s">So</a>  it's important to be timely. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7573.474s">So</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7576.215s">And</a>  that's all I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7577.276s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7578.595s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7579.896s">So</a>  I just want to comment that what I described as the process is for ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7584.7s">It's</a>  not necessarily for resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7586.742s">Resolutions</a>  don't have to go through three readings. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7589.724s">Different</a>  things that we pass through this body have different requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7594.508s">I</a>  certainly was not under the impression that the newsletter had a paper number. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7598.712s">Each</a>  individual monthly newsletter has its own paper number, and therefore, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7603.095s">must</a>  come out of committee and then be discussed in this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7606.697s">I'm</a>  happy to do that if that is what we want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7609.718s">But</a>  I did think that that committee had the ability to pass a newsletter, since it's simply a thing that is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7619.822s">I</a>  totally appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7621.143s">I'm</a>  very happy to change that understanding of mine and to have those sent to this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7626.365s">I'm</a>  not convinced that that would be a great idea, because I think editing, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7632.364s">hundred</a>  and fifty word newsletter in the city council meetings does not seem like a super great use of time.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7638.65s">I</a>  mean, to be honest, it's just like. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7644.346s">We're</a>  spending a bunch of time talking about a couple of semantic issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7648.129s">There</a>  was a resolution <a href="../resolutions/24-015.pdf"><font color="green">24-015</font></a>. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7649.23s">Semantics</a>  for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7650.291s">Well,</a>  it's semantics in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7653.935s">But</a>  it's <a href="../resolutions/24-015.pdf"><font color="green">24-015</font></a> did not explicitly say that the committee could issue the newsletter itself and therefore the committee should have referred something back to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7663.283s">the</a>  council could absolutely vote to say this committee shall do X. We keep papers in committee all the time and meet on them multiple times. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7669.645s">We</a>  just have done it three times in the past two weeks on the city budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7672.627s">So</a>  you are correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7673.807s">And</a>  we have sent out motions from that committee to the administration without them coming before this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7678.709s">Additionally,</a>  we've approved committee reports coming from the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7681.71s">So</a>  arguably it was approved tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7684.811s">So</a>  there's a lot of ways that it happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7686.892s">I</a>  think that's why we're talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7689.773s">Semantics,</a>  I think at this point it would probably be helpful if someone were to file a resolution that formally said the committee can do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7698.298s">But</a>  yeah, it's a real good use of our time.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7704.581s">That's</a>  just so wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7706.582s">It's</a>  semantics. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7708.423s">In</a>  what way, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7710.222s">in</a>  the way that I just described it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7711.443s">Well,</a>  it's pretty embarrassing, because for this council, I deserve the respect that when I bring something forward, that it's given back that same respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7720.669s">And</a>  to call it that is out of line. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7723.671s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7725.132s">I</a>  deserve also the respect that every other council has ever gotten when they sign a letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7729.494s">You</a>  keep talking from the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7731.135s">Well,</a>  just, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7734.398s">Any</a>  further discussion on the matter?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7737.74s">We</a>  should go to public participation or call to question.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7740.202s">Great,</a>  is there a motion to call to question, or do we want to hear from the, do we want to go to public participation? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7744.486s">Any</a>  further comments from councilors? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7747.289s">Hearing</a>  no other motions, name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7751.323s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7752.844s">Gaston</a>  Fierro, 61 Stigney Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7755.946s">So</a>  I thought that this discussion was about processes, same as 24-097, discuss processes dealing with possible homeroom petitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7766.874s">I</a>  read the letter that got signed on April 16th, and that is directly related to subcommittee processes and homeroom petitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7775.98s">So</a>  I just wanted to give my view on <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7779.699s">on</a>  the whole.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7780.78s">How</a>  is it related to the subcommittee processes, if I may ask?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7783.603s">Because</a>  we said on the meeting on March 12th that the discussion was to bring the transfer fee to subcommittee for discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7792.772s">And</a>  then I found this letter signed by the council president and vice president that got sent to the state legislature with <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7803.183s">a</a>  bunch of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7804.524s">So,</a>  um, that's the part that I'm completely confused about, and I can put a little meaning to more detail, and maybe you can answer some of the questions that I have.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7814.152s">I</a>  think it, um, uh, yeah, I think it would be relevant to the, uh, home rule petitions paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7820.157s">Um,</a>  okay, if that is fine, but I'll Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7822.639s">Will</a>  you prefer me to wait? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7823.46s">I'm</a>  happy to wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7824.201s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7825.702s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears and Gaston. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7827.163s">I'm</a>  sorry to interrupt you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7828.384s">I</a>  do think I was just gonna <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7829.785s">I</a>  think that's more relevant to a resolution that is coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7832.328s">I</a>  also have a clarification to offer that I think speaks directly to your question about the difference between what's talked about in the letter and the process of the home rule, but we can get to that under the next paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7841.938s">So,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7842.678s">Yeah,</a>  I'm happy to. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7843.599s">Thank</a>  you for indulging me.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7844.48s">Thank</a>  you, I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7846.743s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7848.084s">Good</a>  evening.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7849.926s">Steve</a>  Sinella, 69 Whittier Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7853.194s">So</a>  I've been getting a ton of calls and emails kind of based upon that letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7858.675s">And</a>  I'm kind of one of the person that reached out to George. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7861.936s">I'm</a>  sure he got a ton of calls that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7865.237s">I</a>  have a petition going kind of that's against the real estate transfer fee, the rent control and the first right of refusal. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7872.981s">And,</a>  you know, it's ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7875.043s">So</a>  we're still building a bunch of people to be able to sign that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7877.606s">But</a>  I was kind of holding this for subcommittee and got a lot of calls stating, you know, it looks like the city council's already signed off on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7885.795s">No,</a>  we have not. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7886.676s">Okay,</a>  well, it's it was taken that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7889.298s">A</a>  lot of people called me and said, I feel like I've not heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7892.722s">No</a>  one's listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7893.783s">No</a>  one cares. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7895.224s">You</a>  know, there's a lot of people in Medford and there's a lot of people you need to listen to and you're not listening at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7900.968s">And</a>  by you, you guys putting that, you should have probably put it as layman and say that, you know, just Zach Beers is doing this and not the president and the vice president. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7910.214s">Um,</a>  I think that's a, you know, a big issue, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7913.196s">So</a>  I'd like to drop off this petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7914.997s">It's</a>  the first many, uh, it's about 300. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7917.399s">And</a>  this was that night that you actually proposed this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7919.84s">We</a>  got about 300 people, uh, kind of to sign this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7922.882s">to</a>  be against what we're looking to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7925.304s">So</a>  if you could just take that and forward it on and hopefully the subcommittee, and that you can clear up that you didn't put this out as the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7936.133s">It's</a>  concerning.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7936.813s">Yes,</a>  you can deliver the petition to Larry. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7938.855s">He</a>  will keep it on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7940.456s">And</a>  what happened, there's two things here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7942.257s">So</a>  there was a letter written to the state house about a piece of legislation proposed by the governor, the Affordable Homes Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7949.966s">and</a>  specifically a portion of that legislation, which would authorize cities and towns to discuss the implementation of a fee, a real estate transfer fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7960.549s">As</a>  individual city councilors and as the council president and vice president, we signed on to the letter supporting that legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7967.251s">That</a>  is separate from the in-council proposal for a discussion of a home rule petition and subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7973.733s">So</a>  those are two different things.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7975.313s">Okay,</a>  I know you're kind of stirring up a bee's nest, more or less, you know, there's a lot of folks that are, you know, starting to get angry about. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7982.997s">I</a>  hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7983.397s">I</a>  think we should clarify that, that it wasn't the City of Medford, it was actually just two people putting it out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7988.559s">Yes,</a>  it was the Council President and Vice President.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7990.78s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7992.281s">I</a>  hope this can be clarifying for people. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7996.741s">I</a>  think the idea is that we have a discussion as a community about what we would want, whether we want it, what it would look like in terms of a transfer fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8007.849s">The</a>  letter that was signed is for the state to allow us to have that discussion, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8015.534s">I</a>  mean, we can discuss it all we want, but we won't be able to- To give us the authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8019.677s">To</a>  give us the authority, right, to have to, once we've had that discussion, to actually pass something. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8029.565s">The</a>  idea of like, I think we all want to be able to have that discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8034.007s">We've</a>  literally not written a single word. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8036.688s">We</a>  want to have the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8039.209s">And</a>  that letter doesn't do anything but try to enable us to be able to have the discussion as a community.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8046.052s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8047.442s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8047.782s">I</a>  don't think it was taken that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8049.123s">Point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8050.224s">I'm</a>  going to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8050.984s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8051.304s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8052.485s">We</a>  can have that discussion whether it's a letter or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8055.127s">Please,</a>  please explain. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8057.788s">That's</a>  sending a wrong message. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8060.71s">We</a>  can have a discussion without sending anything to the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8064.432s">That's</a>  not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8065.232s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8067.438s">Right,</a>  yes, and that's what we're doing in the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8072.203s">I</a>  also, as a councillor, signed a letter about something I think the state should let all cities and towns do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8077.928s">This</a>  is why people were allowed because you used your titles. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8082.172s">That's</a>  all. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8082.873s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8085.215s">Any</a>  further discussion by members of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8086.837s">Seeing</a>  none, I'm going to go to Maureen D. on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8089.079s">Maureen,</a>  name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8101.658s">Maureen,</a>  I'm going to ask you to unmute.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8105.56s">OK,</a>  that's better. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8107.921s">My</a>  name is Maureen Donovan, and I live at 55 Elkworth Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8113.324s">I've</a>  been a resident for 34 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8116.246s">So</a>  I have a copy of the letter right here in front of me, and I read it about a half dozen times and made notations with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8124.45s">And</a>  I agree with somewhat <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8130.529s">everyone's</a>  comments, but I take umbrage, to use the vice president's word, to the fact that it didn't follow a subcommittee process, that there was a lack of transparency, that the two members that signed it blindsided <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8155.138s">more</a>  than 50% of their council members, by putting this forward, that it <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8163.012s">misrepresented</a>  the council in general, but even more grievous, it misrepresented the residents of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8174.4s">And</a>  I will read to you right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8178.202s">We</a>  write to you as municipal officers and staff who work each and every day to provide livable and affordable housing for our residents to express our enthusiastic support. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8194.34s">Now,</a>  correct me if I'm wrong, but the residents of Medford elected this city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8205.507s">So</a>  I think that your mission is to work with the vast majority or popular vote of the city, of the residents in the city of Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8219.557s">and</a>  you didn't represent all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8223.559s">You</a>  represented two of yourselves on the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8230.383s">And</a>  I'd like to know how many of the residents of the city of Medford did you represent when you sent this letter to the state house and signed it?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8245.53s">And</a>  we were representing, as you noted, municipal officers and Councilor Collins and I are two municipal officers.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8252.112s">Yes,</a>  but the rhetoric or the language in the letter insinuated that you were representing the whole body and the residents of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8266.096s">Can</a>  you correct me? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8267.036s">Because</a>  I have it in black and white in front of me.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8269.804s">you</a>  look at the signatures on the letter, there's a section for people who are signing on behalf of the body and officers who are signing as individuals, and Vice President Collins and I were signed under the section representing individuals.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8284.229s">Well,</a>  I respect your individual opinions on this matter, but what I find disrespectful is your lack of transparency and lack of communication with the vast majority of taxpayers in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8305.253s">And</a>  I think that's what you really need to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8310.455s">There</a>  are major issues within our community that get ignored day after day after day. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8317.258s">The</a>  school department, the infrastructure of the streets and sidewalks, just to name a few. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8328.083s">So</a>  could someone like to respond to me about that respectfully?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8334.758s">The</a>  issues we are certainly working on all of those issues we've had, you know, dozens of meetings in the past few months, touching on every subject that you said, but again, you know, we were actually literally as elected officials signing a public letter so that the public would know. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8350.872s">our</a>  position on the local option transfer fee and the Affordable Homes Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8354.754s">So</a>  as individual Councilors, we were sending a letter to inform the public about our opinion on an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8361.498s">The</a>  individual Councilors signing on to public statements does not have to go through any sort of council process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8368.902s">So</a>  that's how that works. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8371.544s">Vice</a>  President Collins, Councilor Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8374.906s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8375.246s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8375.806s">I</a>  made a motion to call the question, but I just want to interject with one more thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8380.046s">Like</a>  I mentioned, I exercise my right and privilege to add my name to sign on letters at my discretion. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8388.728s">Another</a>  topic that we talked about earlier in the agenda, the payment in lieu of tax legislation that's being considered by the State House. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8396.05s">Last</a>  week, I also added my name to a list of signatories separate from the paper that we discussed and dispensed with tonight, I also signed that letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8406.181s">acting</a>  as myself as an individual, signing on as Kit Collins, Vice President of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8411.143s">And</a>  like all the other times that I've done that, the letter was not phrased in such a way as to purport that I was speaking for this council, because I wasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8419.466s">I</a>  made no assertion of speaking for this council, because I wasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8423.188s">I</a>  was endorsing it as an individual. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8425.229s">Tonight,</a>  when we passed that resolution, we chose, through our votes, to endorse it as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8436.61s">And</a>  I don't disparage anybody for feeling angry or disappointed in me for choosing to advocate for issues that you would rather I not. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8447.813s">That</a>  is your right. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8449.654s">I</a>  know that there are many people in the community who disagree with me on that issue and many others, and many who do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8455.016s">And</a>  that is your right, and it is absolutely your right and your privilege to say so in these public meetings, however you want to. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8463.171s">However,</a>  I really do think that we need to correct the record and draw a distinction between an individual official endorsing a policy using their own individual name and saying that this is in some way a breach of our process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8476.994s">They</a>  are two separate things. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8478.714s">You</a>  are well within your rights to say, I disagree with you and I wish you wouldn't advocate for that, but that's not the same thing as us breaking a regulation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8487.856s">And</a>  I really will stop speaking on the topic now.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8490.697s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8491.197s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8491.677s">I'd</a>  like to second the motion.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8494.514s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8496.495s">I</a>  haven't, I don't know what this letter is. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8498.657s">It's</a>  not on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8499.857s">I</a>  haven't read it and I can't find it online. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8501.919s">Can</a>  we not talk about the letter anymore? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8503.48s">Cause</a>  I literally, I don't even know what the letter is. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8507.262s">It's</a>  not on the agenda and it's not included in the packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8509.684s">So</a>  I don't feel equipped to discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8512.505s">And</a>  it's not something that we were supposed to talk about tonight.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8515.247s">On</a>  the motion of Vice President Collins to call the question seconded by Councilor Lemme.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8526.535s">It's</a>  a public letter.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8533.357s">Well,</a>  then why don't the city council members? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8536.458s">Why</a>  aren't they aware of it if it's public?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8538.859s">Green?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8539.619s">I</a>  can't I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8540.48s">I</a>  don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8541.64s">I</a>  don't know what news people read. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8542.941s">I</a>  don't know what letters people read. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8546.843s">I</a>  do not control that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8548.124s">On</a>  the motion of Council Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Leming, to call the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8555.827s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8572.194s">No,</a>  we have people that want to speak.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8573.979s">It's</a>  a motion to call the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8575.4s">It's</a>  a motion to call the previous question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8576.661s">It's</a>  undebatable. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8578.782s">It's</a>  a motion to call the previous question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8580.223s">It's</a>  undebatable. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8582.244s">It's</a>  a police order.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_28]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8585.106s">Did</a>  you withdraw it?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8587.027s">I</a>  said no. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8588.348s">There's</a>  another item. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8589.008s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8592.264s">Yes,</a>  60 for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8593.145s">The</a>  negative motion passes on the rule for the previous question that's initiates a 15 minute period where Councilors may further debate the calling of the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8603.197s">Each</a>  Councilor can speak for up to, I believe, two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8607.646s">Other</a>  councillors would like to speak further on the matter?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8609.527s">Councilor</a>  Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8611.069s">I'd</a>  just like to point out that I second the motion because we still have to get to 24097, which actually discusses the home rule petitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8619.114s">We</a>  were still on the subcommittee processes and we hadn't been really discussing that, so that's all I have to say.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8626.68s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8627.08s">Do</a>  councillors have any further on this paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8631.992s">The</a>  motion is the motion by Councilor Scarpelli to discuss the City Council subcommittee processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8638.015s">And</a>  also, there were two amendments to the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8641.717s">Could</a>  you read back the amendments to the motion, Mr. Clerk?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8645.159s">To</a>  get a legal opinion on whether City Council wants to use the title. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8652.303s">What's</a>  the legal representation on whether using the title as a City Councilor in a campaign? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8661.744s">So</a>  the first one is that... And there's also use of titles by city officials that give the impression that something is offered as an official act of counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8672.528s">And</a>  then there's one about... It was one related to newsletters and whether they were campaigning.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8677.549s">Right,</a>  the question is for the legal department to ask if a newsletter that's being put forth could be construed as campaigning. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8685.049s">But</a>  the question the first question is legal opinion using City Council titles and correspondence to the state or other entities that give the impression that the information is offered as an official act of the City Council.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8700.375s">Can</a>  we further amend that to give the impression to a reasonable person?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8709.502s">the</a>  legal standard. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8710.723s">Mr.</a>  President, if I can, I did forward the edification for Council Leming on the 23rd of that evening at 8.23. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8723.294s">I</a>  didn't have your number readily available, Councilor Leming, so I know that Councilor Villes wasn't in-house that evening.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8729.757s">I</a>  was not at that point, no.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8730.817s">So</a>  I thought I was on the assumption you were, so, because I was also sick, so.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8737.119s">My</a>  apologies for that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8737.98s">No,</a>  what I said was, on that text was, hey, Zach, I'm out if you could just, so you could just move the questions quicker, because I have to leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8748.144s">And</a>  that's when I asked about, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8751.526s">seeing</a>  if we can have any meetings outside of Wednesdays. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8754.713s">So,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8958.755s">where</a>  our leadership moving forward, where the mayor stands on this and getting her more involved as we discuss the processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8971.583s">So</a>  the process for a home rule petition is this council would discuss it, any issue, then it would be voted. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8979.748s">If</a>  it's voted through, it would then go to the mayor's office and the mayor would then have the option to veto it or move it through. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8986.872s">And</a>  then it would go to the state house, correct?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8988.772s">I</a>  believe, actually, that if the mayor chooses not to submit it, that the council cannot overrule her.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8996.763s">I</a>  believe so, yes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8997.504s">Because</a>  the other question was that if it came back to the council, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9001.127s">we</a>  could do vote on overruling her decision.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9005.329s">So</a>  we sent 6-1 last year, the home rule petitions on the budget and the charter ballot questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9012.913s">Those</a>  were sent to her 6-1. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9014.173s">She</a>  did not return them and she did not submit them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9017.315s">There</a>  is no legal requirement under state law, according to the meetings we had with council about that for her to return it to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9023.438s">And</a>  we cannot override her decision.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9025.419s">And</a>  this is the process just sort of to be to be informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9028.541s">Maybe</a>  I'll explain a little bit better. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9030.863s">So</a>  as this process goes on, we start talking about different home petitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9036.227s">The</a>  question also falls in not just in the council, but what the process is with the mayor's office and then with the state delegates and then moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9044.693s">So</a>  I appreciate that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9045.994s">Yeah,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9046.915s">And</a>  I think, yeah, just to go into it just a little more. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9049.884s">Any</a>  Councilor could put a resolution on the agenda to request that this council as a collective body submit a home rule petition to the legislature requesting that the city have the authority to do something that it currently does not have the authority to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9063.247s">For</a>  example, we've submitted a home rule petition to ask Tufts to do the institutional master plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9070.369s">A</a>  charter <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9071.89s">change</a>  would be a home rule petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9074.051s">The</a>  transfer fee was a home rule petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9076.472s">So</a>  that's this body acting collectively to request that state allowed the body to take an action, authorized the city to take action. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9086.276s">Many</a>  home rule petitions have been granted, and there are many special acts that apply to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9092.199s">But</a>  as Councilor Scarpelli noted, a councillor would propose that it would be on a regular meeting agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9097.256s">Um,</a>  that could be referred to a committee as the charter ballot questions were last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9101.92s">Um,</a>  those were then, uh, discussed in committee, referred back to the regular council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9108.264s">The</a>  council voted to send them by a 6 to 1 vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9112.147s">The</a>  mayor decided not to send them to the statehouse, and therefore they died at that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9117.731s">Um,</a>  if the mayor had sent them to the statehouse, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9120.673s">then</a>  the state house would consider the petitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9122.834s">Technically,</a>  they would be entered in by our representatives and senator into the general court as a piece of legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9129.836s">Then</a>  that piece of legislation would have to pass through the state house and the state senate and be signed by the governor, at which point the law, there would be a law of the state of Massachusetts, and that law would say that the city of Medford is authorized to do X. So that is the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9148.504s">Any</a>  discussion by members of the council on the process for a home rule petition? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9154.649s">Seeing</a>  none, discussion by members of the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9157.13s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_28]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9158.611s">Robert</a>  Pinto, Zero Summit Road in Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9162.154s">Regarding</a>  the public letter that was written on April 16th regarding House Bill, I believe it's 3128, the Affordable Home Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9174.103s">In</a>  that particular bill, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9176.141s">There</a>  were transfers fees also that could be beneficial to a community that were discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9182.47s">And</a>  there was seven inclusions as it related what you could and could not do, which also had an opt-in and an opt-out proviso in that bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9192.364s">But</a>  I'd like to, to you, Mr. Chairman, I want to get to your letter of April 28, where you sent out a notice saying, correcting the record on Medved's plans to address the housing crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9204.072s">And</a>  two particular paragraphs were sort of like, watch me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9207.054s">The</a>  first, the first one states the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9209.736s">The</a>  City Council and the City Planning staff are working on zoning rebuild reforms to allow more housing to be built, reduce permitting and regulatory burdens for private property owners, encouraging major economic development, and require construction of more <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9227.916s">subsidize</a>  affordable housing units. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9230.358s">We</a>  are also working on policies to benefit good landlords like the Good Landlord Tax Credit. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9237.422s">And</a>  the second paragraph reads, the final piece of that comprehensive approach <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9243.405s">is</a>  anti-disbursement policies targeted at the large corporations who are buying properties, jacking up rents, and earning a huge profit by knocking out long-time residents and making unnaturally affordable units too expensive for the average person. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9262.242s">I</a>  understand what you wrote, but I don't understand who these large corporations that are coming in here into the city of Medford and they're dispersing people. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9271.87s">I</a>  see houses that are bought by individuals who had an opportunity to buy a single family or two family house as an individual, but not as a corporation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9281.379s">And</a>  you sent this out apparently because you wanted to allegedly, you know, correct something that was sent out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9289.502s">But</a>  if I were to see this as I did see it, I'm confused right now because I don't know of any major large corporations that have come in to the city of Medford and bought single or two family homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9302.369s">either</a>  tore them down, rebuilt them, and sold them for large profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9306.431s">I</a>  know individual people have done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9308.653s">But</a>  when you say large corporations, it makes it look like this city is now being overrun by large corporations. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9315.516s">And</a>  if you're going to address that through your zoning and your community development, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9322.278s">The</a>  wording is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9324.6s">And</a>  this type of wording makes it look like corporate America has just taken over the city of Medford, making it unaffordable for people to live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9332.525s">And</a>  that's not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9333.966s">You</a>  also have the opportunity of a business person or a business lady who may be able to come in here, can afford to buy a single or two or a three family house, do it over, and if they can make a profit, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9345.773s">If</a>  the city really wants to get into affordable housing and low and moderate income housing, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9351.457s">They've</a>  had the last eight years to talk about this and do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9355.978s">And</a>  if they're not going to do it, then maybe it should be on the burden of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9360.359s">And</a>  maybe you just you guys and girls, you just voted tonight on a CPA to give more money out, maybe to a place in the Brooks Estates. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9368.881s">But</a>  put that aside. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9370.241s">If</a>  you're really concerned and really serious about affordable housing, you should start putting all your pennies together on all your nickels and all your dimes and all your resources where the money can come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9380.063s">and</a>  really have a second look. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9382.125s">You</a>  know, when the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I think it's could be almost 12-13 years ago, came out with the CPA tax, we were supposed to, like other cities and towns, get a percentage of what the profit was on the state's annual profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9395.754s">We</a>  haven't gotten anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9397.515s">So</a>  you're really putting the burden right back on the Medford taxpayer, or the Medford city government to go forward and look for that type of development, look for that type of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9407.8s">Well,</a>  here's your chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9409.361s">Before</a>  you get into the, you know, Worcester just got through passing, I don't know if you folks realize it, they just got through passing on April 29th, March 9th of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9420.166s">The</a>  registry as it relates to single and two family and three family homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9424.79s">They</a>  had that, they voted on that in September of 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9428.311s">And</a>  it took them two years before they implemented it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9432.952s">They</a>  are now meeting in their next main meeting to make revisions to it because of the pushback, because there's a lot of stringent material into that registry. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9442.274s">But</a>  the best part about the whole thing, as the city manager said, he's willing to make changes and tone it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9448.396s">Can</a>  you imagine having, if you don't go and register, you're gonna get a $300 fine, and every single day you don't register, it's a $300 fine? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9455.837s">That's</a>  kind of excessive, really excessive. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9458.898s">I</a>  mean, you don't wanna go to these extremes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9461.218s">And</a>  what you do wanna, if you really believe in what you're talking about, you wanna have a full-blown discussions with the pros and the cons, and how this thing can or cannot work, and how does it fit into the city of Medford's lifestyle. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9476.181s">Mr.</a>  Chairman, with all due respect, I do not see large corporations coming into our city in Medford, street after street, buying and taking over real estate, turning it over and making a huge profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9488.329s">If</a>  a single person, be it yourself or any member of the council, has the ability to do it, good luck to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9494.093s">That's</a>  what America is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9496.074s">If</a>  you're trying to reduce the rents, you're trying to reduce the cost of living, trying to reduce everything else, then speak to your state legislature, speak to your federal authorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9505.72s">They're</a>  the ones that should be looking out for you, just as well as your local authorities.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9509.623s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Penta.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9527.715s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9528.776s">This</a>  is Sharon DSO. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9530.097s">I</a>  hope you can hear me clearly. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9531.478s">I</a>  would be there in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9535.181s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9541.066s">Sharon</a>  DSO, I hope you can hear me clearly. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9543.488s">I</a>  would be there in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9547.17s">I</a>  would gladly be there in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9552.374s">But</a>  I had a long day in the dentist chair today. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9556.576s">I</a>  wanted to make a comment briefly by that woman who spoke a little while ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9562.299s">Her</a>  last initial is also a D. Someone at the city council mentioned earlier that they gladly signed with their name the letter recently going to the state house, meaning our residents, and they went to a local college. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9583.015s">Well,</a>  to the best of my knowledge, ladies and gentlemen, I teach literature in composition. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9590.718s">Our</a>  residents, like our children, means each and every one. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9594.979s">No,</a>  not each and every one of us were represented in that letter by consent. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9600.161s">But</a>  moving on to something a little bit more important. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9603.923s">I'm</a>  on the same line with Mr. Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9607.364s">This</a>  issue, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9613.459s">First,</a>  how many people last year applied to affordable housing? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9620.086s">How</a>  many people have been in stress or in waiting on the list? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9625.972s">We</a>  should have this meeting in conjunction with the head of housing of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9631.498s">This</a>  is a very bold move, I feel, and may seem slight to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9636.767s">However,</a>  I think it's a domino effect and it affects many, many homeowners and people who may be transient and have to move after a short stay here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9648.412s">And</a>  however, like the realtors mentioned too, it affects them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9652.773s">There</a>  are many additives in this domino effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9655.795s">This</a>  should be shoved right out of the council tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9659.72s">It</a>  should be reworded also that that paper should be retracted from the state house stating representing our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9670.144s">And</a>  I also thank you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9672.445s">And</a>  I'm hoping we don't see this issue for a very long time until we see numbers, figures, and directors of affordable housing in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9683.149s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9689.241s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9690.582s">Gaston</a>  Fiore, 61 Stigny Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9693.303s">And</a>  I'm just very concerned about the processes, as I said. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9699.646s">So</a>  I just wrote the following, which are just facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9705.189s">And</a>  I would like to engage at the end if there are any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9711.212s">So</a>  let's start with what has been said. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9715.935s">During</a>  the city council meeting on March 12th, some city councilors said the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9720.618s">Councilor</a>  Leming said, quote, another quote, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9741.212s">Vice</a>  President Collins said, quote, as Councilor Leming said, what's before us tonight is whether we want to have the conversation about how to tailor this tool to dedicate a small percentage of only the highest ticket real estate transactions towards the most underinvested in housing in our community, end quote. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9760.751s">Another</a>  quote, I want to be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9762.692s">If</a>  we vote this into committee tonight, then we can and we will get into the weeds. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9767.654s">With</a>  the community, we can discuss how to tailor this to affect the appropriate type of highest value sales just to capture a small percentage of huge value increases that have come into this region, end quote. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9778.658s">Councilor</a>  Callahan said, quote, we literally don't have a single word written about what kind of transfer fee we would do because we can't until we get a number and we send it to committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9789.921s">And</a>  this is going to take months because we're going to take a lot of input from the committee, end quote. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9794.923s">Another</a>  quote, I know way too much about state politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9798.124s">I</a>  can tell you that of any communities that have passed a real estate transfer fee, as with many other housing related issues, the state does not approve them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9807.006s">So</a>  what is going to happen is, we're lucky enough to pass anything that is related to a real estate transfer fee, it will not be approved by the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9813.511s">The</a>  only thing likely to come out through the state is what is going to be very similar to Governor Healey's proposition. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9817.774s">Governor</a>  Healey's proposition, just so you know, is 1% on either side. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9820.716s">Nothing</a>  will affect anyone who sells a house for less than a million dollars, and the only tax is on what is over a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9827.16s">So</a>  if you sell your house for 1.1 million dollars, the total tax for you is $1,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9829.782s">So</a>  you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9831.363s">I</a>  hope I can assuage some people's fears, and I really hope we can have a respectful discussion tonight, and that you can all participate in our many months long discussion that we hopefully will be about to begin, that will happen in perfectly open meetings, which we'll invite you all to come to. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9850.407s">end</a>  quote. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9851.488s">Now,</a>  let's turn to what has been done, not said, done. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9856.031s">On</a>  April 16th, City Council President Bears and Vice President Collins signed a letter addressed to the state's legislature in support of the provisions to enable local option transfer fees in Governor Healey's H4138, the Affordable Homes Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9869.901s">The</a>  letter urged state legislators to pay particular attention to the inclusion of several components, including a provision to allow municipalities to apply fees to the full amount of transactions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9884.089s">I</a>  repeat, to apply fees to the full amount of transactions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9889.491s">So</a>  I ask, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9891.479s">How</a>  did we arrive at just a chasm between what has been said to us in the city council meeting and what has been signed and sent to state legislatures? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9899.783s">How</a>  did we get from wanting to discuss every single detail regarding a possible implementation of a transfer fee to already signing a letter to the state legislature in support of such fees? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9912.068s">How</a>  did we get from wanting to target only the highest value real estate transactions to sign in a letter in support of allowing the fee to apply to the full amount of transactions? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9922.911s">How</a>  did we get from saying that we shouldn't have fear because any real estate transfer fee that passes the city council will not be approved by the state to sign in a letter to lobby the state to allow such transfer fees? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9934.415s">I</a>  do certainly know one thing, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9936.136s">I</a>  personally lost all trust that I had in most members of this city council.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9940.137s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9940.938s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9941.438s">I'm</a>  happy to respond. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9943.659s">I</a>  think a few things are being conflated. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9945.64s">So</a>  what we were talking about on March 12th was a home rule petition for this city council to craft a request to the state to allow Just Medford to implement a real estate transfer fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9959.105s">You</a>  were quoting me and saying, those things don't pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9961.666s">I</a>  completely agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9963.668s">It</a>  was it was Anna. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9964.708s">I</a>  thought it was me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9965.429s">So</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9966.569s">I</a>  basically think the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9969.791s">If</a>  we were to have the committee meeting on the Home Rule petition, we were to report it out of committee, the mayor were to send it to the legislature, but probably go in the same place that the other 18 Home Rule petitions have gone, which is the trash bin. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9984.289s">Separately,</a>  there's three things at play here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9986.33s">There's</a>  the home rule petition by the city council and the mayor to request permission for the city to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9992.854s">There's</a>  the legislation that is at the state house, which would authorize all cities and towns to implement something. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9999.719s">And</a>  then there's what ordinance we would actually pass in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10004.381s">I</a>  support local control on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10007.501s">I</a>  think that the state should give cities and towns, all of them the permission, including what was in that letter, to implement whatever transfer fee those cities and towns want to implement. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10016.904s">I</a>  don't think that my position on what we should implement in Medford should constrain what the people of Nantucket want to implement in Nantucket. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10025.769s">So</a>  I support a broad local option allowing cities and towns to do something that they want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10031.692s">And</a>  I don't think that we should impose our conditions and our politics on other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10035.734s">And</a>  I think that all communities should have the local control on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10039.175s">What</a>  you quoted at the beginning is what all of us said, we would be comfortable passing in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10044.994s">which</a>  is high-end transactions targeted at the high-end real estate. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10049.277s">So</a>  there's three pieces. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10050.978s">I</a>  support a broad local option for all cities and towns to implement a transfer fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10055.641s">That's</a>  different because I believe cities and towns need a lot more authority because the state constrains our authority to do basically anything, so we aren't able to address the problems that people have. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10064.554s">That's</a>  entirely different from what ordinance on a transfer fee I think Medford should pass if we were given that authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10070.538s">So</a>  those are the three pieces, and I hope that clarifies my position on the issue.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10077.403s">So</a>  my view on that is that let's assume that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10083.968s">I</a>  oppose, I'm against theft, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10087.551s">And</a>  I think theft should be, I'm talking in general, it could be something else like murder or something, I don't know, putting an example. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10093.255s">I</a>  think theft should be illegal. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10094.997s">So</a>  I'm not gonna, you know, sign a letter where I'm saying like, well, you know what, I actually, I'm against theft, but I'm gonna let it, I'm gonna let every city decide for themselves whether I want theft, whether they want theft to be illegal or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10110.509s">No,</a>  I won't. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10111.87s">I</a>  am against theft and I think theft should be illegal. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10115.152s">So</a>  why do you support a letter in your capacity as an individual to apply the transfer fee to the full amount of transactions? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10123.157s">Like,</a>  so if I basically don't think that a transfer fee should apply to the full amount of transactions, I don't think it should apply anywhere.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10130.682s">I</a>  don't want someone... I just think it shouldn't apply in Mexico. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10134.084s">I</a>  just think that the full amount should not be here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10136.406s">I</a>  don't think that I should impose my opinion on the people of another city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10140.629s">So</a>  that's my position. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10141.65s">I</a>  support local control for communities, and I also have specific opinions about what I believe Medford should implement.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10146.754s">Okay,</a>  I respect your opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10148.415s">I</a>  just think that, again, if someone opposes something, then it's based on conviction, and then that shouldn't apply anywhere else.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10155.84s">And</a>  I have two convictions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10156.841s">One</a>  is local control, and one is what the ordinance should look like in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10159.523s">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10159.923s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10160.323s">Vice</a>  President Collins, since you also signed the letter.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10163.302s">Thank</a>  you, President Barras. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10164.703s">Thank</a>  you for speaking to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10166.004s">And</a>  again, this is similar to what I said before, but I again want to reinforce, I know that you disagree with, I'm sorry, through the chair, I know that many constituents disagree with me about my opinion on the transfer fee, the Home Rule petition, the Affordable Homes Act, which are again, two separate, totally separate processes about the same topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10184.977s">That's</a>  your right, completely respect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10186.898s">I</a>  know that there's a lot that we disagree on and a lot that we agree on. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10190.12s">But</a>  the thing that I really think is important to reinforce <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10193.038s">is</a>  that we are talking about two different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10197.502s">We</a>  are all endowed with the right to endorse a piece of state-level legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10202.546s">I</a>  think we've probably all done that at different times. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10205.228s">And</a>  there's a separate process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10206.489s">Or</a>  oppose. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10207.13s">Or</a>  oppose. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10208.591s">And</a>  there is a separate process by which we come together as a city council in committee meetings to collectively, in public session, craft what we are actually putting forward to the state house to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10219.824s">the</a>  majority of city councilors voted for this, that we would like for you to put forward as state legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10226.93s">And</a>  I hope that, I'm trying to find the words to make this more clear, because I understand that it's confusing for a lot of people, that the Affordable Homes Act, which is a massive housing bond bill that also includes a proposal for a local option for real estate transfer fee, encounters the same topic as our proposed real estate <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10247.096s">transfer</a>  fee home rule petition that is currently in the permitting and planning committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10250.778s">I</a>  understand that those are easy to conflate because there's that Venn diagram overlap. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10256.822s">And</a>  I just want to reinforce for people who are not as deeply intimate with this issue as all of us behind the rail are and the people who most frequently show up to the public meetings, I just want to make it crystal clear that these are two separate processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10273.171s">They're</a>  related by topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10274.687s">They're</a>  two separate processes, and I just think that's really important to make clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10278.388s">And</a>  if I may, while I have the floor, as we're talking about the processes with possible home rule petitions, I think the most important part of this conversation already happened, which is how do these actually happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10290.593s">What's</a>  the process? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10292.274s">City</a>  Council goes to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10293.834s">They</a>  could full stop at the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10295.935s">If</a>  they don't, they go to the delegation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10298.736s">They</a>  get put forward as a legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10301.701s">I</a>  don't like to talk about this often because I think that we should do them anyway, but yeah, I have no optimism that the Home Rule petition that we may or may not craft here in Medford City Council will become law because traditionally they don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10316.432s">I've</a>  been a member of home, I've been a participant in home rule petition efforts in my first term on the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10322.234s">Did</a>  any of them become law or get even close? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10324.795s">No,</a>  absolutely not. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10326.396s">But,</a>  you know, to use the words of somebody who spoke just earlier, I don't think that this is a slight issue at all, the housing crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10331.538s">I</a>  think that it's a major issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10333.099s">And</a>  that's why I think that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10334.644s">That's</a>  why I think it's so important that we have the conversation with every mechanism possible, including lobbying for state-level legislation, as well as having the conversation about if we should lobby for this, essentially, with a home rule petition, because the issue of displacement and housing unaffordability is so large and so rampant in Medford that I really think it's worth having that conversation anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10358.572s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10359.432s">And</a>  I would note that we voted seven to zero on the pilot legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10363.789s">which</a>  is getting wiped out every session. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10366.451s">Because</a>  we think it's a good idea, even though we don't have confidence that the State House will actually approve the legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10373.475s">Councilor</a>  Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10375.356s">Sorry,</a>  Councilor Lemmie, Councilor- yeah, my bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10378.638s">We</a>  usually have a button and it would show me a list. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10381.78s">So,</a>  we're getting that back.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10387.907s">No,</a>  when I've chaired meetings before, I've definitely like not noticed like which side of my or you just picked the hand that went up last. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10395.361s">No,</a>  so just to be a bit more clear about the practicalities of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10399.463s">So</a>  if the Affordable Homes Act does end up including a provision for us to implement a local option for a real estate transfer fee, the home rule petition proposal in Medford would be moot. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10412.207s">There</a>  just wouldn't really be any point in filing that because we would then have, we would then have it by default what the state gives us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10421.571s">So</a>  we would likely have to file <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10424.472s">another</a>  resolution into a regular meeting in that case and just drop the Home Rule petition if we do get it from the Affordable Homes Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10433.16s">So</a>  hopefully that just clarifies sort of what the process looks like because <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10440.873s">The</a>  18 Home Rule petitions that have been filed, if you actually go and read them, and they're all on the State House website, they're all kind of slightly different and they're a little bit, they just have very different provisions depending on what individual city councils discussed at any given time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10458.681s">And</a>  so if the Affordable Homes Act is passed, all of those would probably just be rejected. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10465.126s">outright</a>  officially because then, you know, everybody would have what the state gave them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10471.953s">That</a>  being said, just to, again, repeat what my colleagues have already stated, there is a definite point in filing these. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10481.135s">The</a>  fact that 18 other communities all filed Home Rule petitions very likely is telling the State House that affordable housing is an issue, and all of that effort by local legislators then led up <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10494.878s">to</a>  what Governor Healey's proposing with the Affordable Homes Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10498.26s">So</a>  the relationship between local and state politics is often a bit of a black box, but yeah.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10506.405s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Callahan.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10513.289s">Thank</a>  you, through the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10515.971s">I</a>  understand that many constituents oppose a real estate transfer fee and that <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10522.156s">know</a>  to make an analogy with theft makes it makes it seem like something of conviction uh for or against something i think a much better analogy is a minimum wage law so in california and other states cities can pass any kind of minimum wage law they want to in massachusetts we cannot um i would sign a something at the state level saying <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10542.95s">please</a>  allow any city or town in Massachusetts to pass any minimum wage that they deem necessary in their own city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10550.215s">But</a>  that doesn't mean that I would want an infinity minimum wage in Medford, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10554.498s">So</a>  you vote, you push for the state to enable you, it's called enabling legislation, to enable you to pass the laws that are correct for your community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10563.905s">And</a>  then within your community, you have the discussion about what would be the right minimum wage for Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10570.734s">And</a>  that is the question that we are having, which is, you know, we are about to begin a long discussion, including the public, about what kind of real estate transfer fee might be the right one for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10584.447s">But</a>  that doesn't mean that individual sitting elected officials who also, by the way, have websites that declare that they, you know, people run on issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10595.745s">You</a>  know, there are things that are on my website that are issues that I support and I ran on those issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10600.227s">I</a>  told people when I was running that I would support those issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10604.289s">That</a>  is why I got elected, because those things were on my website at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10608.411s">And</a>  as city councilors and other elected officials to sign in support of the state, allowing communities to make whatever decision they want doesn't mean that <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10619.824s">you</a>  know, I'm gonna support a $500 minimum wage in Medford, even if I think that any community should be able to have any kind of minimum wage they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10626.888s">So</a>  I just think that that analogy-wise, it's a better analogy that we want the state to allow us to make those decisions.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10635.872s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10637.353s">Any</a>  further comment by members of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10641.295s">We</a>  have Martha Andres on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10643.396s">Martha,</a>  name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10651.465s">Martha,</a>  for some reason we can't hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10660.428s">You're</a>  unmuted, but we can't hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10667.51s">Could</a>  someone check with Shane? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10670.751s">We</a>  still can't hear you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10675.332s">Justin,</a>  can you try saying something? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10678.133s">Can</a>  you hear me?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10679.594s">Yep,</a>  we can hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10681.516s">Martha,</a>  it looks like there might be an issue with your microphone. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10691.222s">You</a>  may need to join audio or reset your microphone. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10694.785s">In</a>  the meantime, I will go to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10697.667s">Eileen</a>  Lerner, name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_26]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10703.331s">My</a>  name is Eileen Lerner and I live at 9 Adams Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10708.053s">And</a>  I'm a part of Medford too, even though I've only lived here 10 years, I'm part of Medford too. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10717.756s">And</a>  Medford has changed a great deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10720.557s">There</a>  are great many people who support the Councilors right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10727.523s">And</a>  that has to be accepted. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10729.524s">You</a>  can't say that they don't represent us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10733.626s">We</a>  voted for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10735.888s">We</a>  approve of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10738.029s">We</a>  love them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10739.51s">They're</a>  doing what we want them to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10742.491s">We</a>  need affordable housing in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10745.313s">I've</a>  had friends who have been so in despair because they can't find a plumber, they can't find an electrician. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10753.057s">And</a>  if those kinds of people have to come from New Hampshire, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10757.299s">to</a>  serve us, they're going to charge us a lot more money than they would if they lived in Medford, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10764.709s">So</a>  one way or another, we're going to be paying for the lack of economic diversity in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10774.201s">We</a>  have to find a way to discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10776.944s">And</a>  we need to have all the things on the table and to try to figure out what's best for Medford and stop attacking our Councilors that we voted for by a large majority. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10793.183s">they</a>  represent Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10796.184s">Now,</a>  there may be people that feel that they're unrepresented. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10800.366s">Well,</a>  I'm sorry about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10802.507s">But</a>  sometimes things change. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10805.928s">People's</a>  ideas about things change. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10809.07s">What</a>  people want changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10811.831s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10813.228s">You</a>  know, you can't ignore the people that voted for this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10817.991s">You</a>  cannot ignore them and say that real Medford wants everything in opposition to what these people want. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10828.318s">That</a>  is not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10829.559s">There</a>  are a great many people who just support them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10833.522s">And</a>  I join with those people to support all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10838.165s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10839.046s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10843.314s">speaker,</a>  I appreciate you coming up to the podium.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10847.277s">Like</a>  I said, it doesn't matter what he says, the vote's the vote.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10854.703s">That's</a>  what this process is. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10856.964s">The</a>  questions that the constituents that reached out to me were with the process, because I believe this council <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10874.87s">There</a>  is an issue with affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10878.451s">But</a>  it's how we're getting there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10880.552s">It's</a>  just a philosophical difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10882.813s">I</a>  think that our administration has done a terrible job using their responsibilities and their powers to bring affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10893.378s">I</a>  think they've done a terrible job over the last five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10896.86s">Terrible.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10905.859s">colleagues.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10907.22s">So</a>  as the Councilors that want to pay for it, they have to look at what you've got right here.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10937.366s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10937.666s">Let's</a>  go back to Martha. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10938.547s">Let's</a>  try this again. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10939.328s">Martha,</a>  name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10942.251s">We</a>  still can't hear you, Martha. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10944.212s">There</a>  is a phone call in on the agenda if you want to try to call in by phone and we could recognize you if you go to the agenda on the city website or on our agenda and meeting portal, but we can't hear you right now.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10957.188s">Martha,</a>  you could also try to click on the little arrow next to the microphone button. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10962.331s">It</a>  could be that your input is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10964.812s">So</a>  sometimes Zoom selects a different input than what's the default on your computer. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10970.155s">So</a>  that could be the issue.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10972.336s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10973.176s">Martha,</a>  we'll try to come back to you again. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10974.817s">I'm</a>  going to go to Bill on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10979.42s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10982.241s">Hi,</a>  Bill Giglio, Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10984.471s">Can</a>  we get just a quick comment? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10986.151s">Can</a>  we stop calling this a fee? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10988.432s">What</a>  it really is is the tax or basically staling from homeowners. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10994.654s">That's</a>  pretty much all it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10995.874s">It's</a>  not a fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10997.354s">You</a>  know, we're not getting anything from it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10999.395s">You</a>  know, we have to give. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11000.915s">So</a>  it's actually staling from a homeowner, to be honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11004.656s">But</a>  it's not a fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11005.936s">It's</a>  either you can either call it a tax or a high fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11009.437s">That's</a>  all.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11012.258s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11015.08s">Martha,</a>  you want to try again? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11015.922s">You're</a>  still unmuted. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11022.711s">Go</a>  back to the podium, Gaston, and if you don't mind, we're on the second round. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11026.536s">If</a>  we could just keep it a little shorter, but yeah, thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11031.983s">I</a>  just want to clarify, I mean, I've said this several times, like, I understand that there's a housing affordability issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11039.827s">I've</a>  said this like several, several times, so I'm not against affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11044.15s">That</a>  would be ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11045.51s">So</a>  I don't want to be portrayed as because I oppose a transfer fee or tax, that I'm against affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11052.494s">I</a>  support affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11055.416s">The</a>  problem, as I've said also before, is that imposing a sales tax on real estate transactions is not going to lower housing prices. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11063.622s">In</a>  fact, it will do the opposite, resulting in setting higher prices. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11065.723s">The</a>  tax might generate revenue for affordable housing, which is a different thing, but it will also make entering the housing market more expensive for average buyers. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11076.462s">This</a>  is easy to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11077.382s">When</a>  an X percent sales tax is imposed on real estate transactions, the direct effect is that buyers will need to pay an additional X percent of the transaction cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11084.003s">If</a>  housing demand remains constant, which we will, or if supply constraints exist, which will keep existing, then sellers have less incentive to lower the prices, leading generally to higher overall costs in the housing market for buyers. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11096.846s">Even</a>  if the government forces a sales tax to be imposed on sellers, which was part of that letter too, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11102.677s">The</a>  sellers may increase the sales price to offset the tax cost indirectly passing this expense to buyers. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11108.284s">Thus,</a>  the interaction with sales tax increases the financial burden on buyers rather than decreasing housing costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11112.589s">And</a>  to conclude, to address the housing affordability problem effectively, which I support, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11118.395s">The</a>  focus should be on increasing the supply of housing rather than manipulating market prices through taxation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11124.478s">This</a>  can be achieved by reducing regulatory barriers that constrain development of new housing units such as zoning laws and lengthy permit processes, encouraging the development of more housing through deregulation with increased supply leading to lower prices through natural market competition. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11138.443s">This</a>  approach not only fosters economic efficiency but also enhances consumer choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11143.405s">I'm</a>  in favor of affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11145.326s">I'm</a>  not in favor of the particular non-solution to affordable housing that you're proposing.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11151.387s">Don't</a>  you agree that they're, depending on the structure of the transfer fee and what the threshold was and what the number of units would have applied to, therefore restricting the parcels and structures that would be considered, there could be substitution effects that would change the who would be the buyer, and that that may be a preferential outcome for the city?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11169.833s">I</a>  think that that's more dictated to the market. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11171.814s">I</a>  see.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11171.954s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11174.301s">Sorry,</a>  go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11175.082s">Oh,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11175.582s">I</a>  think that would be more dictated by the particular market that we are dealing with. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11178.484s">So</a>  if it's a seller's market, it will actually be passed to the buyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11181.647s">And</a>  if it's like a market where, you know, basically it's a buyer's market, then that might be passed to the seller. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11187.291s">But</a>  yeah, I disagree with that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11189.573s">Yeah,</a>  I get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11190.674s">You</a>  just used the word average buyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11191.875s">And</a>  if we're talking about corporate transactions.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11194.917s">Corporate</a>  transactions?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11195.998s">If</a>  we're talking about large buyers, those would not be the average buyer.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11199.013s">No,</a>  no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11199.494s">So</a>  I'm assuming that, well, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11201.776s">So</a>  if we're gonna talk about specific, we can discuss them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11203.978s">We</a>  probably should have.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11204.679s">Yeah,</a>  you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11205.68s">Yes,</a>  Councilor Kelly and then Council Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11209.664s">I</a>  would like to remind everyone that we are discussing the process dealing with possible home rule petitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11218.694s">It</a>  is very important to me <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11221.28s">that</a>  comments made by constituents who are knowledgeable, who should be heard from, and comments made by members of this committee who also are knowledgeable and who should be heard from, all of those comments should be heard by the public at a meeting where they know that this is going to be discussed.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11238.973s">Yes,</a>  I do not have the authority under the Supreme Judicial Court to police the content at the podium, and I also have a simultaneous duty as the chair to state facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11246.638s">So</a>  sometimes that will be in dispute with the principle you just said, but I generally agree with the principle that you just stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11251.862s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11255.885s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears and Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11257.606s">I</a>  appreciate you refocusing us on the actual text of our discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11262.53s">So</a>  I just want to make one further comment, and then I will <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11269.025s">the</a>  question again, I guess, though I feel more confused about the meaning of that motion than I did a half hour ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11274.368s">But</a>  I think that we've had a robust discussion on this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11277.67s">But</a>  in terms of the, I think, the most important part of our discussion about the processes of dealing with possible home rule petitions is just the technical process, like the universe of what can happen with home rule petitions, which we already talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11291.358s">But</a>  just as speaking about these home rule petitions in particular, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11296.525s">as</a>  the chair of the planning and permitting committee, which they are both assigned to, in terms of what residents can expect from these home rule petitions in particular, and because the issue of, and because the concept of what else are we doing about affordable housing just got brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11312.295s">I</a>  agree, I certainly would never assume that people who don't happen to endorse the idea of a real estate transfer fee are not proponents of increasing affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11322.728s">Most</a>  of politics is just disagreeing over the tactics and not the outcomes or goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11327.712s">And</a>  to that end, my expectation as chair of the committee in which a lot of these affordable housing conversations are going on is that we have, this is also the committee in which we are discussing our slate of major comprehensive amendments to our zoning code. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11347.688s">And</a>  that gets brought up a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11348.689s">People</a>  talk about making it easier for developers to build in Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11352.534s">both</a>  to increase our commercial tax base, to make it easier to add new high quality residential units. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11359.779s">We</a>  are going to lay the conditions for that to happen through updating our zoning code. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11365.923s">Speaking</a>  as the chair of the committee, that is my priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11368.304s">This</a>  is something that this council has been working on, I know, for at least two terms, which means one term longer than I've been a part of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11376.155s">pivotal</a>  work that we are going to be doing on this committee, that's my priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11379.397s">I</a>  don't expect to take up these formal petitions until the fall because we have a budget to pass in May and in June, and we have a lot of work to get through with our zoning consultant, which this council fought for, for, I'm gonna say, at least three calendar years. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11396.63s">I</a>  think we're so serious about the issue of housing affordability that when we say every tool in the toolbox, we really mean it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11402.619s">We're</a>  going to talk about zoning that will make it easier to develop commercially and residentially in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11407.3s">We're</a>  going to talk about ADUs, which I know are really important, you know, kind of on the minds of many Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11414.581s">And</a>  we're also going to talk about home rule petitions, but the work that is squarely within our jurisdiction, zoning, as chair, I'm always going to prioritize that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11424.283s">And</a>  so in terms of the process, in terms of the timeline that people can expect, I just want to, I want, I feel like, I thought this was a, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11432.15s">a</a>  topical time to bring that up, both in terms of the timing that people can expect these to go over and also to just kind of recontextualize these formal petitions with everything else that this council is prioritizing to do with the outcome of increasing affordable housing in Medford and also increasing the commercial development that will expand our resources to support our residents and all manner of other infrastructural and constituent services project.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11461.271s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11462.231s">Any</a>  further discussion by members of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11471.035s">Approve</a>  what?</p>

 <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11721.554s">this</a>  is a budget that was proposed in, uh, 12 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11727.658s">Um</a>  2 to 494 initially proposed in 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11729.16s">Um</a>  this budget ordinance we are now following for this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11732.282s">It</a>  codifies into law, a process by which the council and the mayor's office will collaborate on the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11739.367s">We</a>  have been having preliminary budget meetings much earlier than we have in the past, and we are hearing from our <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11750.856s">and</a>  we have now had some timely financial reporting, and the ordinance requires further timely financial reporting going forward in all future years. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11759.221s">So</a>  that is, I think, a significant improvement over some recent conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11763.804s">And</a>  with that, we approved it for first reading on March 19th, 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11768.487s">It</a>  was advertised in the Medford Transcript and Summerville Journal on April 11th, 2024, and it is now eligible for a third reading today, Tuesday, April 30th, 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11777.773s">Is</a>  there a motion on the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11781.792s">On</a>  the motion of Vice President Collins to approve for third reading, seconded by.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11943.76s">Yes,</a>  we can hear you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11945.064s">Um,</a>  I wanted to raise to the council that there's a rumor going on that the Medford police are going to be used to break up a peaceful demonstration on Tufts campus tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11956.031s">Um,</a>  you know, I don't know if this is going to happen or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11958.692s">But</a>  I want to say that <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11961.594s">I</a>  believe students have clearly a First Amendment right to peaceably assemble and to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11970.963s">It's</a>  a right that it tops to pay $90,000 a year for. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11975.987s">I'm</a>  dismayed that the city resources are potentially going to be used in such a manner to break up a peaceful demonstration. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11987.138s">I</a>  want to say that I hope that Mayor Lungo-Koehn doesn't allow this to happen, and to also ask what it is that the City Council can do to make it clear that perhaps this should not be happening, or to <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12009.157s">at</a>  least voice some concern for the rights of these students who seem to be in jeopardy this evening.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12017.435s">Thank</a>  you for your comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12018.876s">I</a>  can just speak for myself and Vice President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12021.758s">I'll</a>  just speak for myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12022.618s">You</a>  can speak for yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12023.839s">I</a>  have been in communication with the mayor and the Medford police since Friday about this issue and trying to liaise with protesters to implore Tufts to reach a negotiated solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12035.666s">And</a>  I also do not support the use of public resources to address this protest by force. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12045.773s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12046.769s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12047.53s">Thank</a>  you for bringing this forward to this forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12053.032s">Along</a>  with President Bears, I've also been made aware of the situation by protesters on Tufts campus and people working with them, supportive of their cause. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12062.676s">Just</a>  community members who have noticed this going on over the past few days. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12066.257s">I've</a>  tried to remain in contact with those organizers. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12069.259s">Also</a>  been in contact with our mayor, chief of police, and the government affairs liaison on Tufts campus about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12076.842s">I've</a>  been very clear with all of those leaders and decision makers that my opinion is that <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12084.244s">This</a>  is, it would be a insupportable use of city resources to deploy Medford police to break up what has been a peaceful and unproblematic student demonstration. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12097.909s">This</a>  is not germane to the use of our city resources, but as a Tufts alumnus, I'm very proud to see the students there joining into this cascade of peaceful demonstrations across the nation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12112.392s">And</a>  speaking as a community representative, I am deeply concerned about the safety of students and other community members on campus should the Tufts administration decide that a forcible removal of protesters is the objective that they are going to accomplish by use of force and by use of Tufts University Police. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12137.216s">I</a>  hope that it doesn't come to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12139.957s">I</a>  pray that it doesn't come to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12142.257s">I</a>  think that that would end badly. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12144.039s">I</a>  think that we've seen on other campuses that this is an extenuating event that should be allowed to remain a peaceful demonstration, a gathering place, a place for students and community members to process what's going on, to gather together and to show their solidarity. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12160.931s">I</a>  think that it would be, I would hate to see something so benign <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12168.999s">speaking</a>  here as an individual community member, and again, speaking as a Jewish person, I would hate to see something so benign be escalated because of the use of police force in breaking up a peaceful protest. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12180.782s">And</a>  so I'll reiterate my message to our administration and Tufts administration that I unequivocally would condemn the use of police force, whether Tufts or Medfords, especially Medfords, to forcibly decamp the protesters <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12196.851s">from</a>  where they have been camping out, gathering, making food, celebrating Passover on the Tufts University academic quad. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12205.366s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12206.445s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12206.925s">And</a>  I would just add that there are other campuses that have been able to reach agreements with protesters to maintain the protests. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12214.528s">And</a>  I believe that Tufts has the capacity to do the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12217.289s">I</a>  would also add, speaking directly to the conversation that we had tonight about the number of city resources that go to Tufts when they do not pay property taxes, that is particularly galling that they would ask us to use them to displace protesters. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12230.654s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12232.809s">From</a>  what I've read about the reasoning behind the interest in removing the protesters from the tough squad also is that I think that there can be some justifications made for use of force in removing protesters. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12249.143s">I'm</a>  not saying that I necessarily agree with this, but that it would be for blockage of traffic or some <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12259.144s">danger</a>  posed to the public, but this is on Tufts property and only for the purpose of setting up for commencement. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12269.35s">And</a>  I would definitely caution the Medford Police Department that it really doesn't seem to be the business of our administration or our Medford police to be involved in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12288.251s">I</a>  think this is a big national movement that's happening and that students should be allowed to express their opinions and practice their First Amendment rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12300.302s">And</a>  just as an anecdotal story, I was in the car listening to NPR when they were talking about police removing protesters from Columbia University. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12310.705s">And</a>  my nine-year-old said, is protesting illegal? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12313.085s">And</a>  I said, no, it is not. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12315.746s">It</a>  is very much not illegal to protest. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12318.666s">So</a>  that's all I'll say about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12320.007s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12321.687s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12321.947s">Any</a>  further comment by members of the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12325.208s">Any</a>  further discussion by Vice President Collins?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12327.629s">Sorry,</a>  just one thing to add. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12329.741s">I</a>  know a couple people have reached out to me saying, what can the city council do about this to make sure that the people demonstrating on Tufts campus are kept safe? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12338.648s">As</a>  we often say, the city council instructs and commands no city staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12343.912s">There's</a>  very little that we can, there's nothing that we can do to interfere formally, or sorry, I shouldn't say interfere. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12349.056s">There's</a>  nothing that we can do directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12352.099s">to</a>  affect what happens on Tufts campus, but I would say to constituents that are observing this meeting, if you are of the opinion one way or the other on how Medford police resources should be deployed, if you feel that they should not be used to disperse a peaceful encampment on the grounds of a private university, if you feel that's inappropriate, now would be a good time to let the administration know. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12378.033s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12379.954s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12382.362s">Any</a>  further comment by members of the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12385.086s">Seeing</a>  none in the chamber, I will go to Bill Giglio on Zoom.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12394.561s">Hi,</a>  Bill Giglio, Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12399.908s">So,</a>  you may tell you nine year old also that it is illegal for the Columbia students that are breaking into buildings, taking over buildings, smashing glasses with him, that's illegal. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12413.288s">So</a>  I do want to say I 100% support the police being there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12416.512s">I'm</a>  happy they're there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12417.814s">I</a>  hope they're there in full force. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12419.095s">We</a>  see what's going on around these campuses, the violence, the, you know, everything that's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12426.004s">So</a>  I want to thank the police for for for being there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12429.888s">And</a>  we've also seen this in Boston as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12432.109s">And</a>  I hope anyone that goes outside the lines of protest and is arrested, I hope they're fully prosecuted, which they usually they usually just let go. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12442.031s">But</a>  in any event, I really hope that the police is there in full force and I appreciate our police force. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12446.812s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12477.319s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12477.88s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to adjourn seconded by Councilor Nishikawa. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12480.501s">Please</a>  call the roll.</p>
