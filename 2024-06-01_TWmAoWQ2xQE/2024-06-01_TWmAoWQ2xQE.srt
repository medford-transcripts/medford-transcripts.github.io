[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

39
00:01:34,869 --> 00:01:35,309
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, affirmative.

40
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:37,571
[SPEAKER_15]: None of the negative motion passes.

41
00:01:37,591 --> 00:01:39,173
[SPEAKER_15]: 24-095 be resolved.

42
00:01:39,213 --> 00:01:48,641
[SPEAKER_15]: The city council recognized the amazing work of Samantha McLaughlin and Adam Costello, members of the CCSR and fifth grade students from the Brooks Elementary School on providing safety whistles for postal workers.

43
00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:50,343
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli.

44
00:01:50,383 --> 00:01:51,264
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

45
00:01:51,924 --> 00:01:54,687
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, this is, um, this is another, um,

46
00:01:56,394 --> 00:02:06,264
[SPEAKER_17]: another process where you see the CCSR program assisting young people with innovative ideas that give back to our community.

47
00:02:06,384 --> 00:02:16,354
[SPEAKER_17]: We had two fifth graders that saw the need after witnessing the holdup of

48
00:02:17,154 --> 00:02:42,016
[SPEAKER_17]: one of the mail carriers on TV, and I believe they took it upon themselves, both Savannah and Adam, two Brooks students, to find a way to assist our mail carriers for their safety and providing them with whistles for, and this is so, it sounds so simple, but it's the minds of great,

49
00:02:43,427 --> 00:02:48,892
[SPEAKER_17]: two great individuals that were raised the right way, that saw a need and they stepped up.

50
00:02:48,952 --> 00:03:05,346
[SPEAKER_17]: In typical Medford fashion, this is what makes Medford Medford, that we have young people seeing the need for something, reaching out to their school and the CCSR to really put something together.

51
00:03:05,967 --> 00:03:08,068
[SPEAKER_17]: And we should all celebrate that.

52
00:03:08,809 --> 00:03:19,699
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd make the motion that we invite them to our next meeting and hopefully give them a citation and really applaud their effort for what they've done.

53
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,800
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you, Mr. President.

54
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,263
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sure you have much to say as well.

55
00:03:24,803 --> 00:03:27,485
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I mean, I think you have said most of it, but you know,

56
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:35,794
[SPEAKER_15]: A, our postal workers are doing incredibly important work that I know lately under incredibly difficult circumstances.

57
00:03:36,755 --> 00:03:45,039
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm grateful that young people in the city are taking up the mantle of trying to provide some community service.

58
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:48,801
[SPEAKER_15]: And our CCSR across every school in the district does amazing work.

59
00:03:48,921 --> 00:03:52,522
[SPEAKER_15]: So I want to thank all the students and the educators who make it happen.

60
00:03:54,023 --> 00:03:55,624
[SPEAKER_15]: I do want to go to Councilor Tseng.

61
00:03:57,298 --> 00:04:03,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President Bears, and thank you to both you and Councilor Scarpelli for putting this on the agenda.

62
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:10,421
[SPEAKER_03]: I think these items on tonight's agenda really show the great work that's happening in our public school system right now.

63
00:04:12,642 --> 00:04:21,484
[SPEAKER_03]: This item in particular, I think, really exemplifies the proactive spirit and the innovative spirit that we see from so many of our students.

64
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,325
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it really goes,

65
00:04:26,091 --> 00:04:43,644
[SPEAKER_03]: it's, I think it should be noticed, right, that these are our young folks, our young students at the Brooks Elementary School, which kind of like shows us that no matter what age you are, Medford students are stepping up and stepping up to meet the demands of the moment.

66
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,665
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's also really important to

67
00:04:47,429 --> 00:05:02,604
[SPEAKER_03]: celebrate the CCSR, such a wonderful organization that we have in our schools that allow our young folks to get stuff like this done and to get experience about how to make change and to respond so quickly to events in our community.

68
00:05:03,064 --> 00:05:03,865
[SPEAKER_03]: So really,

69
00:05:04,986 --> 00:05:09,307
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I want to heap praise on the educators as well, who've spent so much time organizing.

70
00:05:09,327 --> 00:05:10,767
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's a lot of work.

71
00:05:10,888 --> 00:05:21,910
[SPEAKER_03]: And having been involved in the organization itself, I know it takes a lot of work from both the students and the teachers to really carry through and execute a project like this.

72
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,691
[SPEAKER_03]: So really proud of our students.

73
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:32,453
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there's so much more that we can look forward to for the CCSR and our students and all of our students in general.

74
00:05:34,662 --> 00:05:36,343
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further comment on the resolution?

75
00:05:36,363 --> 00:05:43,388
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motions of myself and Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Callaghan.

76
00:05:43,448 --> 00:05:50,052
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll and we will invite these folks to our next regular meeting.

77
00:05:50,192 --> 00:05:50,392
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

78
00:05:51,492 --> 00:05:51,573
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

79
00:05:51,593 --> 00:05:51,653
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

80
00:05:51,673 --> 00:05:51,753
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

81
00:05:51,773 --> 00:05:51,893
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

82
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:52,293
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

83
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:52,573
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

84
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:08,071
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, 70 affirmative, none negative, the motion passes.

85
00:06:08,091 --> 00:06:21,234
[SPEAKER_15]: 24086 by myself and Councilor Scarpelli, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we congratulate former Councilor Rick Caraviello on the honour of being named 2024 Citizen of the Year by the Medford Chamber of Commerce, and we thank Rick for his decades of service to the city of Medford and his residence.

86
00:06:21,294 --> 00:06:21,894
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli.

87
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:23,594
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Council President.

88
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:26,535
[SPEAKER_17]: This is an amazing resolution.

89
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:30,216
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought that, you know, if you all leadership, and we brought it up, I just thought that

90
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:39,336
[SPEAKER_17]: a resolution for a great person, even before Rick Caraviello put his name out there to run for mayor.

91
00:06:39,936 --> 00:06:48,283
[SPEAKER_17]: Rick, as a Medford Mustang and a committed member of this community,

92
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:52,473
[SPEAKER_17]: with no fanfare.

93
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:56,095
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think no one really would have known what Rick has done if he didn't run for mayor.

94
00:06:56,515 --> 00:06:57,815
[SPEAKER_17]: And they use it as platforms.

95
00:06:57,855 --> 00:07:00,936
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know Rick, he was very taken back.

96
00:07:00,956 --> 00:07:07,959
[SPEAKER_17]: He didn't want to talk about the things he did, because Rick Caraviello was the person that did everything when nobody was looking.

97
00:07:09,171 --> 00:07:10,832
[SPEAKER_17]: and he didn't want anybody to know.

98
00:07:11,412 --> 00:07:13,233
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's what's amazing about the person.

99
00:07:13,953 --> 00:07:20,316
[SPEAKER_17]: And being named the citizen of the year, I think is an amazing award for an amazing person.

100
00:07:21,036 --> 00:07:33,342
[SPEAKER_17]: So the fact that if I had the opportunity to go to the banquet, listen to him speak, and you see the names on that list of the former, the former,

101
00:07:34,861 --> 00:07:38,363
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, honorees of that award, and you see the greatness.

102
00:07:38,644 --> 00:07:42,486
[SPEAKER_17]: And when I say the greatness, it's just people giving back.

103
00:07:43,667 --> 00:07:50,371
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just people loving Medford, and people giving back to the community, and especially those people that give back when no one's looking.

104
00:07:50,972 --> 00:07:57,636
[SPEAKER_17]: I know we have a few people here, I think Rick Orlando's here, one person is a former award winner.

105
00:07:57,716 --> 00:07:57,816
[SPEAKER_17]: And

106
00:08:00,117 --> 00:08:10,646
[SPEAKER_17]: This is, this is for someone I'm glad Zach brought this up that I'd like Rick to come out and I think we should really honor him, even if I know he's going to be a little bit quicker.

107
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:15,311
[SPEAKER_17]: He had knee replacement, so he'll get to the, he'll get to the podium a little quicker, but, um,

108
00:08:16,554 --> 00:08:18,456
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I'm honored to call him my friend.

109
00:08:18,516 --> 00:08:21,297
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm honored that I got to serve with him on this council.

110
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:34,386
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm honored that I got to watch him help so many and teach me that selflessness to just give back when no one's watching and see the impacts it made in people's lives.

111
00:08:34,426 --> 00:08:40,591
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that he read a few stories that people wanted to read because of his award.

112
00:08:40,751 --> 00:08:42,112
[SPEAKER_17]: And you realize the impact that

113
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:47,566
[SPEAKER_17]: that he never intended to make and how moving it was.

114
00:08:47,646 --> 00:08:50,307
[SPEAKER_17]: So to my friend, congratulations.

115
00:08:50,548 --> 00:09:06,718
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, I would love to invite him, Council President, to our next meeting and him and his lovely wife, Carol, because I know that if it wasn't for Carol, he wouldn't be able to do all those selfless things that he's done for this community.

116
00:09:06,778 --> 00:09:07,278
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you.

117
00:09:08,158 --> 00:09:09,059
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

118
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,340
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further comments from members of the Council on this paper?

119
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,081
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Collins.

120
00:09:13,151 --> 00:09:14,071
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, President Bears.

121
00:09:14,171 --> 00:09:16,652
[SPEAKER_31]: I thank you very much and Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this forward.

122
00:09:18,473 --> 00:09:25,855
[SPEAKER_31]: Former Councilor Caraviello was clearly a man for whom, you know, showing up for his community and doing right by other people was simply a way of life.

123
00:09:25,955 --> 00:09:32,297
[SPEAKER_31]: It was simply his instinct, you know, regardless of, you know, politics.

124
00:09:32,397 --> 00:09:35,617
[SPEAKER_31]: And I know people put a lot of that, you know, especially onto this council and these chambers.

125
00:09:36,018 --> 00:09:39,899
[SPEAKER_31]: But from knowing Rick for a couple of years, you know, I think anybody who meets him knows him.

126
00:09:41,363 --> 00:09:42,845
[SPEAKER_31]: you know, you see his heart on his sleeve.

127
00:09:42,925 --> 00:09:51,173
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think it's just wonderful to see that recognized in the community, you know, the spirit of service by which he's truly lived his entire life in many roles.

128
00:09:51,693 --> 00:09:53,035
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm glad to see him acknowledged.

129
00:09:53,455 --> 00:09:57,419
[SPEAKER_31]: And I will say I miss seeing him every Tuesday and Wednesday in the chamber.

130
00:09:57,439 --> 00:09:58,320
[SPEAKER_31]: So congratulations.

131
00:10:00,162 --> 00:10:01,303
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

132
00:10:01,363 --> 00:10:01,904
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Tsengeed.

133
00:10:02,739 --> 00:10:03,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

134
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,042
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to ditto everything that's been said so far.

135
00:10:07,142 --> 00:10:09,943
[SPEAKER_03]: I miss seeing him in the chambers as well.

136
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:16,347
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it really, I mean, I think all community members can really see how much Rick.

137
00:10:18,086 --> 00:10:25,517
[SPEAKER_03]: former councilor is given to our community, both in his capacity as a city councilor, but also just as a private citizen in our city.

138
00:10:26,198 --> 00:10:31,185
[SPEAKER_03]: His leadership really speaks volumes, especially when you look at the effects of his leadership.

139
00:10:31,866 --> 00:10:33,628
[SPEAKER_03]: When you look at the people that he's helped.

140
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:44,062
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, Rick means a lot to me, because he was such a mentor to me in the council chambers and in getting involved in Medford politics.

141
00:10:44,502 --> 00:10:49,950
[SPEAKER_03]: He really, I think, showed me what leadership looks like.

142
00:10:52,072 --> 00:11:05,196
[SPEAKER_03]: saying words, he showed me the actions, and he showed me how you build those connections, how you get to know folks who live at home and all the business owners, and how you listen to them more empathetically.

143
00:11:05,796 --> 00:11:13,318
[SPEAKER_03]: And really, I think that spirit is something that's so important to the jobs that we do as city councillors.

144
00:11:16,818 --> 00:11:17,718
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further discussion?

145
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:22,241
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll just say that I echo my fellow Councilors' comments.

146
00:11:22,901 --> 00:11:41,253
[SPEAKER_15]: Serving with Rick for my first two terms on the Council, some of them with Rick in leadership, through the pandemic, it was a powerful time, an interesting time, and we sometimes agreed, sometimes disagreed, but always got along before and after meetings, agreed to disagree.

147
00:11:43,144 --> 00:11:57,795
[SPEAKER_15]: definitely work together behind the scenes on several projects, just trying to, you know, go at things from our perspectives and try to advance different proposals, work with different property owners and people who wanted to bring development to our community and try to

148
00:11:58,354 --> 00:12:08,159
[SPEAKER_15]: I encourage that in different ways and I know that that was a big passion of Rick's and he is someone who I hope will continue to do that advocacy as a private citizen.

149
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,942
[SPEAKER_15]: I also just have spoken to so many people involved with our new Metro Public Library.

150
00:12:13,502 --> 00:12:23,889
[SPEAKER_15]: who are very grateful to former Councilor Caraviello for his work to bring that library to our community, work with the Library Foundation, along with many others.

151
00:12:24,309 --> 00:12:35,496
[SPEAKER_15]: And he really was a leader of that, and we have now a beautiful public library, and at a very reasonable cost to the community.

152
00:12:35,556 --> 00:12:41,280
[SPEAKER_15]: So it was a great accomplishment, and I know that he's very proud of it, and we're all very grateful to him for his work.

153
00:12:42,426 --> 00:12:44,006
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further comment on the resolution?

154
00:12:47,907 --> 00:12:53,749
[SPEAKER_15]: Seeing none, on the motion by myself and Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

155
00:12:53,969 --> 00:12:54,909

[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

00:13:05,532 --> 00:13:05,772
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

166
00:13:05,792 --> 00:13:07,173
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Tseng?

167
00:13:07,673 --> 00:13:07,833
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

168
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:11,408
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I mean affirmative, non-negative, the motion passes.

169
00:13:11,428 --> 00:13:32,413
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to have a packed list of invitations for our next meeting because our next resolution is 24098 be it resolved by Councilor Tseng, be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate the Medford High School Orchestra on winning a gold medal and the Medford Middle School String Ensemble on winning a silver medal at the prestigious Massachusetts Instrumental and Chorus Conductors Association Concert Festival.

170
00:13:32,473 --> 00:13:33,093
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Tseng.

171
00:13:33,985 --> 00:13:35,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much President Bears.

172
00:13:36,788 --> 00:13:44,437
[SPEAKER_03]: As many of us know, Medford is home to one of our state's strongest music and arts programs in our public school system.

173
00:13:44,878 --> 00:13:48,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks to the leadership of many teachers, one of whom

174
00:13:49,503 --> 00:14:07,711
[SPEAKER_03]: I know very personally, Miss Sophia Chang, she has developed this program at the middle school and high school levels of a string ensemble and the string orchestra program where students are really learning top level skills in arts and in strings playing.

175
00:14:09,773 --> 00:14:25,065
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had the opportunity to listen to high school players from around the state, working with a lot of them, teaching them, playing with them, and truly Medford has something very, very special.

176
00:14:25,645 --> 00:14:34,091
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so, so happy that our orchestras won awards at the MICA Festival, which is a festival I played in a long, long time ago.

177
00:14:34,992 --> 00:14:37,154
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a very difficult stage to perform on.

178
00:14:37,894 --> 00:14:44,799
[SPEAKER_03]: You're performing in front of a crowd of judges, a crowd of music professionals who are all very well renowned in their fields.

179
00:14:45,560 --> 00:15:02,652
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be able to overcome those nerves, and not only just overcome those nerves, but to win gold and silver medals with a very strict scoring system, I think speaks really highly to the level of our students to compete and to perform on such a really high level.

180
00:15:03,332 --> 00:15:19,481
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to amend this resolution to invite the students into our next regular meeting on May 14th to receive citations and to invite them for a short performance for the City Council if the Council will indulge the orchestra.

181
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:25,624
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Councilor Tseng, as amended by Councilor Tseng, any further discussion?

182
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:26,705
[SPEAKER_21]: Second.

183
00:15:27,165 --> 00:15:28,606
[SPEAKER_15]: Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

184
00:15:29,747 --> 00:15:31,868
[SPEAKER_15]: Seeing no further discussion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

185
00:15:32,381 --> 00:15:33,022
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Kelly.

186
00:15:33,322 --> 00:15:33,522
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

00:15:34,823 --> 00:15:35,664
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice-President Collins.

00:15:35,764 --> 00:15:35,985
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

189
00:15:36,385 --> 00:15:37,226
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Lazzaro.

190
00:15:37,706 --> 00:15:37,967
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

191
00:15:38,327 --> 00:15:38,828
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Kelly.

192
00:15:39,048 --> 00:15:39,288
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

193
00:15:39,849 --> 00:15:40,549
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Stroud.

194
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:40,950
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

195
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:41,811
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Tseng.

196
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:42,551
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

197
00:15:44,093 --> 00:15:44,894
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I move the affirmative.

198
00:15:44,914 --> 00:15:46,295
[SPEAKER_15]: None of the negative motion passes.

199
00:15:46,395 --> 00:15:46,796
[SPEAKER_15]: Records.

200
00:15:46,816 --> 00:15:49,118
[SPEAKER_15]: The records of the meeting of April 16, 2024 pass to Councilor Cowen.

201
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,621
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Kelly, how did you find those records?

202
00:15:51,901 --> 00:15:54,223
[SPEAKER_05]: I did find one error, which I already sent to the clerk.

203
00:15:54,323 --> 00:15:55,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I say what that error was?

204
00:15:58,243 --> 00:15:59,984
[SPEAKER_21]: I can say what the error was, because I already fixed it.

205
00:16:00,525 --> 00:16:01,185
[SPEAKER_05]: I do remember, so.

206
00:16:01,685 --> 00:16:09,031
[SPEAKER_21]: I had you moving for approval on something, and it was actually Vice President Collins who had moved for approval on it, and I fixed that.

207
00:16:09,731 --> 00:16:10,071
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

208
00:16:10,312 --> 00:16:12,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Aside from that, I found the records to be in order.

209
00:16:12,393 --> 00:16:13,254
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

210
00:16:13,574 --> 00:16:19,798
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Councilor Highland to accept the records, seconded by Vice President Collins.

211
00:16:19,838 --> 00:16:20,679
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

[SPEAKER_15]: Having the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion passes, the records are accepted.

221
00:16:52,856 --> 00:16:55,616
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion to join the reports of committees?

222
00:16:55,876 --> 00:16:56,237
[SPEAKER_20]: So moved.

223
00:16:56,857 --> 00:16:59,858
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Vice-President Collins to join the reports of committees, seconded by?

224
00:16:59,878 --> 00:17:00,558
[SPEAKER_15]: Second.

225
00:17:01,038 --> 00:17:02,678
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Lemmie, would you please call the roll?

226
00:17:05,814 --> 00:17:05,974
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

227
00:17:06,615 --> 00:17:06,715
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

228
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:06,895
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

229
00:17:07,075 --> 00:17:07,435
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

230
00:17:07,655 --> 00:17:07,795
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

231
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:26,494
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll give a short summary of the first two and then the committee chairs can give summaries of the rest.

232
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,191
[SPEAKER_15]: the whole budget April 23rd 2024.

233
00:17:52,251 --> 00:17:54,413
[SPEAKER_15]: This is our second preliminary budget meeting.

234
00:17:54,453 --> 00:18:04,180
[SPEAKER_15]: We did receive a presentation from director Dickinson that went into finance director Dickinson that went into the expected revenue for the fiscal 25 budget.

235
00:18:04,841 --> 00:18:10,225
[SPEAKER_15]: Um and also we heard from the legislative department, the finance department, the clerk's department, all of which were either

236
00:18:15,589 --> 00:18:22,533
[SPEAKER_15]: to just factor in the increase in the non-union staff contracts.

237
00:18:22,573 --> 00:18:25,474
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, the only increase in those departments were fixed cost growth.

238
00:18:26,055 --> 00:18:34,299
[SPEAKER_15]: We just had another preliminary budget meeting tonight, and we have one tomorrow, and then we will have some more in the weeks to come.

239
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:42,183
[SPEAKER_15]: But we are getting ahead of the budget, and I don't think we will be rushing through it in a couple weeks in June, which is an improvement.

240
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:48,433
[SPEAKER_15]: 24.015 and 24.073, Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee.

241
00:18:48,874 --> 00:18:49,496
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor LEMMING.

242
00:18:50,302 --> 00:18:50,722
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

243
00:18:51,003 --> 00:18:58,509
[SPEAKER_18]: So at the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee, we first discussed the first April newsletter of the Medford City Council.

244
00:18:58,529 --> 00:19:16,705
[SPEAKER_18]: So I sent copies around of that or drafts around that to all of my fellow council members and flagged down potential edits to those, as well as a schedule that Councilors would go by month to month to draft the newsletter prior to submitting it.

245
00:19:17,165 --> 00:19:17,806
[SPEAKER_18]: to the committee.

246
00:19:17,966 --> 00:19:34,777
[SPEAKER_18]: Most of the committee session was dedicated to editing the newsletter, so it was a bit of a bit of a Word document session as I took in edits and suggestions in real time and tried to correct my own draft language there.

247
00:19:36,158 --> 00:19:37,859
[SPEAKER_18]: Following that, there was a

248
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:55,168
[SPEAKER_18]: motion to send the newsletter to regular session, but that motion didn't receive a second, so we decided to, so we ended up voting on a motion to approve the newsletter entirely and send it out.

249
00:19:56,249 --> 00:20:01,631
[SPEAKER_18]: So it was, so the first draft of it is currently on the Medford City Council page.

250
00:20:01,671 --> 00:20:02,872
[SPEAKER_18]: We're currently discussing

251
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:07,861
[SPEAKER_18]: methods of circulating that around the community with the communications director and the clerk.

252
00:20:09,123 --> 00:20:20,356
[SPEAKER_18]: Additionally, we voted to establish listening sessions, ended up voting to establish the subcommittee consisting of myself, Councilor Callahan and Councilor Tseng to

253
00:20:21,149 --> 00:20:50,529
[SPEAKER_18]: organize those in order to establish monthly listening sessions in which a few City Council members would meet up with the community of seniors, the community of tough students, veterans, as well as the five community liaisons in Medford in order to have City Council do active outreach to different members of the community.

254
00:20:51,489 --> 00:20:54,370
[SPEAKER_18]: And, yeah, that was pretty much all we discussed.

255
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:55,290
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

256
00:20:55,310 --> 00:21:00,452
[SPEAKER_15]: 24033 and 24083, Vice President Collins, Planning and Permitting Committee, April 24th, 2024.

257
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:02,592
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, President Barras.

258
00:21:02,812 --> 00:21:07,474
[SPEAKER_31]: On April 24th, we discussed with our zoning consultant the following topics.

259
00:21:08,114 --> 00:21:17,117
[SPEAKER_31]: Some suggested forthcoming proposals to improve the site plan review process, updating the use and dimensional tables, as well as

260
00:21:19,974 --> 00:21:21,756
[SPEAKER_31]: There's one other thing, and I just forgot it.

261
00:21:22,076 --> 00:21:28,722
[SPEAKER_31]: We had an update from our zoning consultant, and our next meeting with the zoning consultant in planning and permitting is next Wednesday, May 8th.

262
00:21:29,944 --> 00:21:35,229
[SPEAKER_31]: And then after that, we had a affordable housing presentation from Metro Housing Partnership.

263
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,053
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

264
00:21:40,073 --> 00:21:42,556
[SPEAKER_15]: 24084, Public Works and Facilities Committee, Councilor Calderon.

265
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

266
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:53,074
[SPEAKER_05]: We had the pleasure of having Commissioner Tim McGibbon as well as our engineer Owen Wartella there to discuss our roads and sidewalks.

267
00:21:54,094 --> 00:22:03,058
[SPEAKER_05]: There had been a pavement assessment done in 2021, and we got to see the pavement assessment that was just done recently as an update.

268
00:22:03,718 --> 00:22:10,061
[SPEAKER_05]: We, there were, you know, essentially they talked us through how the roads have,

269
00:22:12,657 --> 00:22:30,730
[SPEAKER_05]: basically what they have been doing with the roads, which includes coordinating with the utilities when they need to do repairs on the road, making sure that utilities are, in fact, doing all the road repair that they are supposed to be doing, as well as getting all the different kinds of funding that they possibly can.

270
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:40,636
[SPEAKER_05]: We are, in fact, repairing roads at approximately... There were five different strategies that were recommended, and we are repairing the roads

271
00:22:41,797 --> 00:22:52,841
[SPEAKER_05]: better than the middle strategy, but not as well as the top strategy because we do not have the funding to do that level of repair to the roads.

272
00:22:52,861 --> 00:23:01,384
[SPEAKER_05]: So if there is going to be an improvement in the roads in Medford, it does look like funding will have to increase.

273
00:23:02,865 --> 00:23:05,366
[SPEAKER_05]: It just comes straight out of both of those pavement assessments.

274
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:16,863
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was what we discussed in, oh, they also have, they bought the equipment to do a hot tub crew, to have an internal crew doing road repair.

275
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:28,911
[SPEAKER_05]: They just need to have to access the funding to be able to staff that, which we think will be less expensive than, for certain levels of repair will be less expensive.

276
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:30,372
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the update for that.

277
00:23:30,834 --> 00:23:31,074
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

278
00:23:31,094 --> 00:23:33,858
[SPEAKER_15]: I think just to add to that there was a response to your question.

279
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:41,467
[SPEAKER_15]: What would it cost him and Tim McGibbon set up 400,000 to 700,000 depending on the scale of the staffing.

280
00:23:41,767 --> 00:23:45,552
[SPEAKER_15]: And that would move us from having a crew out two to three times a month to two to three times a week.

281
00:23:46,946 --> 00:23:47,686
[SPEAKER_17]: So I appreciate that.

282
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:49,827
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe that if I can, Mr. President.

283
00:23:49,947 --> 00:23:53,328
[SPEAKER_17]: I apologize, because I couldn't get on.

284
00:23:53,388 --> 00:23:57,429
[SPEAKER_17]: I was listening and I couldn't get on to the last second and I apologize for that.

285
00:23:57,449 --> 00:24:03,791
[SPEAKER_17]: But I know that engineer Olin said that we're looking at substantial figures, correct?

286
00:24:03,891 --> 00:24:07,573
[SPEAKER_17]: What, $6 million a year to catch up?

287
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:08,753
[SPEAKER_15]: Five years, 6 million?

288
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:13,734
[SPEAKER_15]: The middle path that Councilor Callahan was mentioning was 3.5 million a year.

289
00:24:13,754 --> 00:24:14,615
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's basically,

290
00:24:15,595 --> 00:24:29,493
[SPEAKER_15]: the line was going down ever so slightly on the condition of the roads for 6 million a year we had an increase in conditions and he said that we were between those two numbers right now and he's now working for the first time in the city to estimate

291
00:24:31,195 --> 00:24:34,497
[SPEAKER_15]: When utilities repair the roads, what's the dollar value of that relative?

292
00:24:34,517 --> 00:24:37,198
[SPEAKER_15]: And then you could add up Chapter 90 bond money.

293
00:24:37,218 --> 00:24:38,039
[SPEAKER_15]: That's good.

294
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:39,220
[SPEAKER_15]: That's good to see.

295
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,901
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're somewhere in between those two.

296
00:24:42,061 --> 00:24:43,002
[SPEAKER_15]: If I can, though.

297
00:24:43,042 --> 00:24:44,042
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, Councilor Scarpelli.

298
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:45,563
[SPEAKER_15]: If I can, I didn't realize.

299
00:24:47,124 --> 00:24:47,864
[SPEAKER_17]: Could we just have a 24.015 and 24.073?

300
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:49,765
[SPEAKER_17]: I won't be supporting that paper, so I apologize.

301
00:24:56,489 --> 00:25:02,891
[SPEAKER_15]: on the motion to sever the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee.

302
00:25:02,931 --> 00:25:05,671
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a second?

303
00:25:08,472 --> 00:25:15,594
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, on the motion to sever the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Leming.

00:27:55,032 --> 00:27:59,473
[SPEAKER_15]: Shane, can we do a sound check here?

339
00:28:00,653 --> 00:28:03,433
[SPEAKER_15]: We just put the contract out to redo the sound systems.

340
00:28:08,614 --> 00:28:09,214
[SPEAKER_15]: How about now?

341
00:28:09,294 --> 00:28:10,835
[SPEAKER_15]: Is this any improvement?

342
00:28:12,135 --> 00:28:12,975
[SPEAKER_20]: We have a problem.

343
00:28:13,715 --> 00:28:16,376

00:28:23,516 --> 00:28:26,557

346
00:28:29,338 --> 00:28:32,840

347
00:28:37,381 --> 00:28:40,102
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we don't have the ability to adjust individual microphones.

348
00:28:50,421 --> 00:28:52,764
[SPEAKER_15]: They don't want to do a test, test, test.

349
00:28:54,727 --> 00:28:55,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Test, test.

350
00:28:56,149 --> 00:28:56,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Test.

351
00:28:56,709 --> 00:29:01,055
[SPEAKER_06]: I've only said yes so far, so.

352
00:29:02,097 --> 00:29:02,417
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

353
00:29:03,999 --> 00:29:06,522
[SPEAKER_15]: The caption is picking it up.

359

360
00:30:07,682 --> 00:30:10,484
[SPEAKER_15]: By order of the Medford City Council, Adam Hurtubise, City Clerk.

361
00:30:12,626 --> 00:30:17,710
[SPEAKER_15]: I will go to Councilor Scarpelli, our Chair on Licensing, and then we can hear from a petitioner if the petitioner is present.

362
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:18,651
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

363
00:30:19,311 --> 00:30:20,072
[SPEAKER_15]: And we'll go from there.

364
00:30:20,532 --> 00:30:25,596
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think that we see that for our Snappy Patty petition,

365
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:30,785
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, they're looking for the extended hours just for Thursday, Friday and Saturday, 11 to 1.

366
00:30:31,586 --> 00:30:41,936
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, we have, I have talked to, uh, the, uh, building inspector's office and, um, um, talk to them, uh, getting some feedback.

367
00:30:42,825 --> 00:31:08,576
[SPEAKER_17]: on any issues and concerns of the establishment, their well-respected establishment, and being that one of the questions we did hear from both people that were for or I didn't have anybody against that reached out, but that they've been great businesses and the fact that it doesn't abut a neighborhood, which makes it very important, I think was something we see.

368
00:31:08,596 --> 00:31:10,137
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that if there is a petitioner here,

369
00:31:10,831 --> 00:31:12,754
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a petitioner present for Snappy Pats?

370
00:31:12,774 --> 00:31:13,696
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, Snappy Pats.

371
00:31:14,597 --> 00:31:14,938
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, sir.

372
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:15,559
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

373
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:21,449
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you can share your petition and Councilor Scarpelli may have some questions for you.

374
00:31:22,251 --> 00:31:24,214
[SPEAKER_16]: First, before I begin, can I answer any questions?

375
00:31:25,872 --> 00:31:29,314
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that it's just... We've been open for greater than 10 years.

376
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:31,636
[SPEAKER_15]: No, can we have your name and address for the record, please?

377
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:31,876
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

378
00:31:31,896 --> 00:31:34,758
[SPEAKER_16]: My name is Adam Gazzola, and I'm the owner of Snappy Patties.

379
00:31:35,598 --> 00:31:38,821
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm on the petition and the file and the liquor license.

380
00:31:39,301 --> 00:31:39,481
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

381
00:31:39,601 --> 00:31:43,604
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, this is something that we come about many times.

382
00:31:43,744 --> 00:31:49,648
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that the petitioner comes with respect, background, no issues.

383
00:31:49,668 --> 00:31:50,268
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that

384
00:31:51,449 --> 00:31:53,090
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, I would support this.

385
00:31:53,150 --> 00:32:04,558
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that whenever we've done this, we do put a 30 day and then a 60 day, um, uh, just to review with, uh, the building inspector just to give us any updates if they hear anything different.

386
00:32:05,258 --> 00:32:09,441
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, and like, like I said, I think that, uh, I don't see anything.

387
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:11,182
[SPEAKER_17]: I see everything else in order, Mr. President.

388
00:32:11,502 --> 00:32:17,186
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, people have to know the approvals tonight go with the, the, the, the owner.

389
00:32:17,896 --> 00:32:25,804
[SPEAKER_17]: And if it's changed in any way to a different owner, then the process would have to be reassessed with the new owner of the business.

390
00:32:25,824 --> 00:32:27,665
[SPEAKER_17]: That was one of the questions that someone asked.

391
00:32:27,705 --> 00:32:34,912
[SPEAKER_17]: So if anybody else has any questions, I don't see any concerns or issues with this petition.

392
00:32:35,613 --> 00:32:42,099
[SPEAKER_15]: Any questions for the petitioner for the petition to extend hours of operation Thursday, Friday, Saturday, 11 p.m.

393
00:32:42,219 --> 00:32:42,539
[SPEAKER_15]: to 1 a.m.? ?

394
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:45,383
[SPEAKER_15]: see none.

395
00:32:45,403 --> 00:32:46,524
[SPEAKER_15]: I do have one question.

396
00:32:46,805 --> 00:32:50,849
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you planning to be every Thursday, Friday, Saturday open till one a.m.

397
00:32:51,109 --> 00:32:53,772
[SPEAKER_15]: Or would it be more as needed?

398
00:32:54,292 --> 00:32:55,193
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, it is.

399
00:32:56,909 --> 00:33:04,471
[SPEAKER_16]: very much community driven, so we've never stayed open, nor do I think we will ever be open until 1 a.m.

400
00:33:04,531 --> 00:33:07,992
[SPEAKER_16]: in Medford, there just isn't a calling for it.

401
00:33:08,912 --> 00:33:21,275
[SPEAKER_16]: It's generally when it's a private reservation, it's often people from City Hall that request for the anniversary, retirement, birthday party, and they wanna come in from 10 o'clock.

402
00:33:22,355 --> 00:33:25,296
[SPEAKER_16]: And everyone says they're gonna stay until one, but they're generally home by,

403
00:33:26,294 --> 00:33:29,495
[SPEAKER_16]: by midnight if ever, if we were to have a party like that.

404
00:33:29,855 --> 00:33:31,695
[SPEAKER_15]: Earlier than a council meeting.

405
00:33:31,755 --> 00:33:40,217
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, so we're a family, we're basically a family restaurant and we're trying to answer the calling of the community.

406
00:33:41,117 --> 00:33:48,019
[SPEAKER_16]: And at best in the summertime, we maybe go an extra half an hour on our patio than we do in the wintertime.

407
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:52,140
[SPEAKER_16]: But I mean, it's even fewer hours when there's snow on the ground.

408
00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:52,868
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

409
00:33:53,228 --> 00:33:54,969
[SPEAKER_16]: That's just how the community kind of breathes.

410
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:55,629
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

411
00:33:55,929 --> 00:33:57,990
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, you know, we'll see what we can do.

412
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,810
[SPEAKER_15]: These are the businesses we want to keep it met.

413
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:00,470
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, of course.

414
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:01,270
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

415
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:01,871
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll see what we can do.

416
00:34:01,891 --> 00:34:03,451
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe we can get some of that to meet.

417
00:34:03,651 --> 00:34:04,611
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

418
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,912
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we need to open the public hearing, so thank you.

419
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:18,315
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you just stay up here for one second, I'm going to open the public hearing in one moment, open the public hearing to anyone who is in favor, in opposition, or who would otherwise like to comment on the special permit.

420
00:34:18,776 --> 00:34:19,796
[SPEAKER_15]: Public hearing is now open.

421
00:34:21,442 --> 00:34:24,885
[SPEAKER_15]: Would you like to comment on the petition in favor, opposed, or otherwise?

422
00:34:24,905 --> 00:34:27,447
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm guessing you're in favor.

423

[SPEAKER_15]: Great, thank you.

425
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:39,897
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak in this public hearing in favor or in opposition to this special permit, or otherwise would like to speak on the proposed special permit?

426
00:34:46,434 --> 00:34:50,697
[SPEAKER_15]: Seeing no one in the Chamber and seeing no hand raised on Zoom, I declare the public hearing closed.

427
00:34:51,317 --> 00:34:51,918
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion?

428

[SPEAKER_15]: So we are opening a discussion with the chair of the Subcommittee on Licensing, Permitting and Signs, Councilor Scarpelli.

447
00:37:16,479 --> 00:37:16,820
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

448
00:37:18,701 --> 00:37:19,582
[SPEAKER_17]: Is a petitioner here?

449
00:37:20,263 --> 00:37:22,025
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we have a petitioner from Pinky's Pizza?

450
00:37:22,085 --> 00:37:25,248
[SPEAKER_15]: You can come to the podium and we will hear from you.

451
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:33,315
[SPEAKER_17]: I am waiting for, just for clarification, I am waiting for the building department

452
00:37:34,378 --> 00:37:38,519
[SPEAKER_17]: I tried to call today just to get an update with any reports.

453
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:44,660
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm probably going to ask the table this, or extend it to our next meeting.

454
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,040
[SPEAKER_17]: But I did have questions.

455
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:59,563
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that when we've had concerns of neighbors, I think that we see you've done everything that you need to do, and we want to support you in any way we can.

456
00:37:59,623 --> 00:38:04,084
[SPEAKER_17]: But you're going from one extreme to the next, and being to the point that

457
00:38:04,484 --> 00:38:05,765
[SPEAKER_17]: it's in a residential neighborhood.

458
00:38:06,245 --> 00:38:24,193
[SPEAKER_17]: And the biggest fear, we've received multiple emails with residents that love you guys, that think that you're great, hardworking people, but at the same time, it really affects their quality of life with not people that you have control of, it's with your customers or with the shared drivers that come in.

459
00:38:24,793 --> 00:38:29,235
[SPEAKER_17]: parking in front of people's homes, engines revving, music on, they run in and grab an order.

460
00:38:29,595 --> 00:38:32,736
[SPEAKER_17]: So they find it that it's gonna be a huge disservice for that neighborhood.

461
00:38:32,796 --> 00:38:49,603
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would tend to just offer that the timing to two o'clock in the morning, I wouldn't personally as one Councilor, especially in a residential area, I wouldn't really support that.

462
00:38:49,643 --> 00:38:50,543
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's just too late.

463
00:38:50,944 --> 00:38:53,985
[SPEAKER_17]: But I will, like I said, Mr. President,

464
00:38:55,074 --> 00:39:13,404
[SPEAKER_17]: If we continue the meeting, then I'll make the motion that I'm still waiting to see if there's a way that we could figure something out with our building department, with our inspectors and our neighbors, to see if we can extend some hours to help you with your business, but at the same time, not affect the quality of life of that neighborhood.

465
00:39:13,485 --> 00:39:17,687
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you could give us your name and address and tell us, just give us a summary of your proposal.

466
00:39:18,246 --> 00:39:19,726
[SPEAKER_04]: So my name is Prabhjot Kaur.

467
00:39:20,406 --> 00:39:25,707
[SPEAKER_04]: The business address is 165 Main Street, Medford, and it's Pinky's Famous Pizza.

468
00:39:27,107 --> 00:39:30,288
[SPEAKER_04]: So we open till like 10 right now.

469
00:39:30,508 --> 00:39:35,469
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't know, and in the community, there's only a couple of restaurants that open till late.

470
00:39:36,169 --> 00:39:43,330
[SPEAKER_04]: And usually pizza is something that, you know, when people get home late, that's when they wanna, you know, we're not doing too much business during the day.

471
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:47,551
[SPEAKER_04]: In the evening, when it starts getting busy, we have to close.

472
00:39:48,351 --> 00:39:51,155
[SPEAKER_04]: And the latest because the open is still 11 right now.

473
00:39:52,277 --> 00:39:57,944
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were just thinking of, you know, how we can get more revenue and, you know, not be losing money.

474
00:39:57,964 --> 00:40:05,014
[SPEAKER_04]: At this point, and you know, this was just a thought we didn't know how it would go if the neighbors would agree or not.

475
00:40:05,494 --> 00:40:05,574
[SPEAKER_04]: So

476
00:40:06,275 --> 00:40:09,197
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be fine with whatever you guys can offer.

477
00:40:09,217 --> 00:40:12,440
[SPEAKER_04]: 12 or I don't know, maybe one, if not two.

478
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:16,143
[SPEAKER_04]: This was the, I think, the most we could ask for.

479
00:40:16,663 --> 00:40:17,504
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what we did.

480
00:40:17,584 --> 00:40:20,026
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some other that are open to like one and two.

481
00:40:20,246 --> 00:40:22,227
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what just we went with.

482
00:40:22,668 --> 00:40:25,490
[SPEAKER_04]: But if we could do 12 or something, we will be fine with that too.

483
00:40:26,178 --> 00:40:26,258
[SPEAKER_15]: you.

484
00:40:26,278 --> 00:40:26,558
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

485
00:40:26,638 --> 00:40:27,158
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

486
00:40:27,278 --> 00:40:30,220
[SPEAKER_15]: If I can't do that now, we can go to questions from members of Council.

487
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,840
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll go to Councilor start by the council.

488
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,021
[SPEAKER_17]: If I can.

489
00:40:33,061 --> 00:40:37,782
[SPEAKER_17]: I just that I wear a body that really wants to try to support local businesses.

490
00:40:37,822 --> 00:40:48,266
[SPEAKER_17]: So if we could find a way, maybe we can talk after the meeting that maybe we could, you know, reach out to a couple of those neighbors and maybe or if you can do some outreach, those neighbors that surround your your

491
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:59,509
[SPEAKER_17]: the reports that the emails that I received had nothing to do with how hard you work and how much they love your establishment.

492
00:40:59,889 --> 00:41:08,556
[SPEAKER_17]: The question is, they're just afraid of the outside people or activities that you have no control over.

493
00:41:08,576 --> 00:41:09,476
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's what they were questioning.

494
00:41:09,496 --> 00:41:11,878
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's why I don't wanna deny anything this evening.

495
00:41:12,299 --> 00:41:17,743
[SPEAKER_17]: If we can just, I'd like to motion that we move this to our next meeting, just extend it.

496
00:41:18,263 --> 00:41:22,164
[SPEAKER_17]: for two weeks and maybe... Given the time frame, I have to open the public hearing and then we can continue.

497
00:41:22,304 --> 00:41:23,145
[SPEAKER_17]: We can do that, right.

498
00:41:23,185 --> 00:41:26,806
[SPEAKER_17]: But I just want to give a petition, just what we're looking to do.

499
00:41:26,886 --> 00:41:32,367
[SPEAKER_17]: So maybe there's a way that we can talk to our neighbors and see if we can find something.

500
00:41:32,387 --> 00:41:40,110
[SPEAKER_17]: I think there's something here that we can work with the neighborhood, but I know what scared everybody was one o'clock and two o'clock every night.

501
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:40,830
[SPEAKER_15]: It makes sense, yeah.

502
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:42,430
[SPEAKER_17]: There's an old nurse, so thank you.

503
00:41:42,851 --> 00:41:46,912
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, two o'clock is definitely... I don't think there are many licenses in the city, maybe one or two.

504
00:41:47,712 --> 00:41:50,214
[SPEAKER_15]: 1 o'clock is a little more common, midnight more common than that.

505
00:41:51,254 --> 00:41:55,917
[SPEAKER_15]: So we do have to align with that as well as we discussed with the Oasis permit.

506
00:41:55,957 --> 00:41:59,259
[SPEAKER_15]: I will go to Councilor Leming for a question for the petitioner.

507
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:06,403
[SPEAKER_18]: How much does business differ from Monday to Thursday versus the weekend, Friday, Saturday and Sunday?

508
00:42:06,464 --> 00:42:06,804
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

509
00:42:07,751 --> 00:42:08,432
[SPEAKER_04]: like money wise?

510
00:42:09,092 --> 00:42:17,781
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, like how much to share your figures, but yeah, just yeah, just just ballpark, like how much more people you see on the weekends versus the weekdays.

511
00:42:17,922 --> 00:42:20,324
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a big difference weekdays, it's not that much.

512
00:42:21,806 --> 00:42:26,270
[SPEAKER_04]: But weekends, especially like Friday and Saturday is when we do good business.

513
00:42:27,171 --> 00:42:32,436
[SPEAKER_04]: given like, you know, and then, or if we have long weekend, like games or something, then we'll do good on Sundays.

514
00:42:32,576 --> 00:42:36,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise it's just Friday and Saturdays when we actually get good revenue.

515
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:43,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise it's just like, not, I'm not going to say slow, but it's not as good as Friday and Saturday.

516
00:42:43,506 --> 00:42:43,766
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

517
00:42:44,146 --> 00:42:44,407
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

518
00:42:44,427 --> 00:42:48,370
[SPEAKER_18]: So the Friday and Saturday hours would be the ones that would help that business the most?

519
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:48,751
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

520
00:42:48,771 --> 00:42:49,311
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

521
00:42:49,351 --> 00:42:49,651
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

522
00:42:50,512 --> 00:42:50,832
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

523
00:42:50,873 --> 00:42:52,354
[SPEAKER_18]: Any further questions for the petitioner?

524
00:43:01,772 --> 00:43:07,595
[SPEAKER_15]: Seeing none, I'm going to open the public hearing for anyone in favor, in opposition, or who would otherwise like to make a comment.

525
00:43:07,615 --> 00:43:10,276
[SPEAKER_15]: Public hearing is open.

526
00:43:10,936 --> 00:43:12,197
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you in favor of the petition?

527
00:43:12,217 --> 00:43:12,677
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

528
00:43:13,238 --> 00:43:13,478
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

529
00:43:13,738 --> 00:43:15,999
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there anyone who would like to comment at this time?

530
00:43:19,581 --> 00:43:19,821
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

531
00:43:20,581 --> 00:43:22,142
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you could, we'll have him come.

532
00:43:22,222 --> 00:43:24,883
[SPEAKER_15]: And if there's anyone on Zoom who would like to comment, please raise your hand on Zoom.

533
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:31,610
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. D'Antonio, name and address for the record, please.

534
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:32,931
[SPEAKER_00]: Anthony D'Antonio.

535
00:43:33,211 --> 00:43:34,591
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.

536
00:43:34,611 --> 00:43:36,551
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 Hicks Avenue in Medford.

537
00:43:37,892 --> 00:43:44,853
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be in favor for the petition, because you talk about a crowded environment, late hours.

538
00:43:45,413 --> 00:43:51,974
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know on Yale Street, where my house is, we have the Oasis, we have Bocelli's, we have a few other things going on.

539
00:43:52,215 --> 00:43:57,796
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a parking lot at Double Curse, because what happens is when they leave the restaurant, they hang out in the parking lot.

540
00:43:57,816 --> 00:43:58,996
[SPEAKER_00]: They have loud music playing.

541
00:44:00,293 --> 00:44:01,694
[SPEAKER_00]: All kinds of distractions there.

542
00:44:02,334 --> 00:44:12,842
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't see a couple of delivery cars making that much of a difference on the street because it's not as thickly settled where their shop is as our place on Yale Street is.

543
00:44:12,962 --> 00:44:15,423
[SPEAKER_00]: So give it a chance.

544
00:44:15,443 --> 00:44:17,085
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

545
00:44:20,267 --> 00:44:21,668
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address for the record, please.

546
00:44:23,206 --> 00:44:25,448
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't prepare anything, but my name is Mary Doyle.

547
00:44:25,629 --> 00:44:32,096
[SPEAKER_10]: I live at 35 Damon Road, but I own 170 Main Street, which is directly across the street from Pinky's.

548
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,118
[SPEAKER_10]: And to your comment.

549
00:44:34,824 --> 00:44:39,766
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a Richdale parking lot right next to my house, which is where some of our bedrooms are.

550
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:53,752
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's my concern, is that people are going to, you know, I'm in favor of the beer hall, I think it's great, but my fear is that, you know, people are gonna leave the beer hall, wanna get pizza, and they're gonna be parking right underneath our bedroom windows.

551
00:44:55,170 --> 00:45:06,679
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm concerned about the Uber Eats and the other delivery services where, especially in the summer, they blast their radios, they don't turn their cars off, they go in to get their packages.

552
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,983
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have people in that apartment and I'm gonna be moving back to that apartment.

553
00:45:12,323 --> 00:45:13,324
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to sleep at night.

554
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:22,271
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't mind one o'clock on a Friday and Saturday night, but on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, I think it's just,

555
00:45:24,747 --> 00:45:25,631
[SPEAKER_10]: Totally opposed to it.

556
00:45:28,202 --> 00:45:28,403
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

557
00:45:28,584 --> 00:45:28,905
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

558
00:45:29,066 --> 00:45:29,387
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

559
00:45:30,845 --> 00:45:42,807
[SPEAKER_15]: And it sounds like there is a motion to continue the public hearing to our next regular meeting, May 14th, please, on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to continue this public hearing to our next meeting on May 14th, and we'll be able to coordinate with them.

560
00:45:42,867 --> 00:45:51,029
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think Councilor Scarpelli is coming up to do it right now, to talk with the building department and try to get to something that could work for everyone.

561
00:45:51,049 --> 00:45:57,010
[SPEAKER_15]: And we'll have further conversations, and thank you for your willingness to work with us on that as well.

562
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:04,449
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to continue the public hearing to the May 14th regular meeting, seconded by Vice President Collins.

563
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:06,451
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

564
00:46:07,371 --> 00:46:07,971
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Kelly?

565
00:46:08,051 --> 00:46:08,232
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

566
00:46:08,752 --> 00:46:09,572
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Collins?

567
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:10,033
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

568
00:46:10,353 --> 00:46:11,193
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Lazzaro?

569
00:46:11,593 --> 00:46:11,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

570
00:46:12,254 --> 00:46:12,794
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Livingston?

571
00:46:12,934 --> 00:46:13,234
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

572
00:46:13,815 --> 00:46:14,535
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Scarpelli?

573
00:46:14,575 --> 00:46:14,795
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

574
00:46:15,115 --> 00:46:15,576
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Tseng?

575
00:46:16,076 --> 00:46:16,316
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

576
00:46:18,277 --> 00:46:18,497
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

577
00:46:18,517 --> 00:46:20,418
[SPEAKER_15]: I have the affirmative, negative, motion passes.

578
00:46:20,898 --> 00:46:23,260
[SPEAKER_15]: Hearing is continued to the date certain of May 14th.

579
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:32,150
[SPEAKER_15]: 24-074 offered by Council Vice President Collins be resolved with the Medford City Council review the annual surveillance report.

580
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:33,332
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Collins.

581
00:46:33,919 --> 00:46:34,960
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, President Barras.

582
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:40,443
[SPEAKER_31]: And I actually want to start with an apology because I didn't notice until just this moment that the, oh, thank you.

583
00:46:41,003 --> 00:46:47,988
[SPEAKER_31]: I didn't notice until just this moment that the first two pages of the annual surveillance report that I submitted are actually missing from our agenda packet.

584
00:46:48,828 --> 00:47:00,735
[SPEAKER_31]: They don't add anything particularly substantive, but what is included is just the surveillance report from the Medford Police Department and not the city council surveillance report that actually summarizes the data.

585
00:47:00,935 --> 00:47:03,637
[SPEAKER_31]: That's what our obligation is to submit at this point.

586
00:47:04,178 --> 00:47:05,541
[SPEAKER_31]: It doesn't add anything substantive.

587
00:47:05,621 --> 00:47:13,755
[SPEAKER_31]: It tallies up the number of approvals and denials of surveillance technology that we did in the preceding calendar year, which in this report is zero.

588
00:47:14,597 --> 00:47:15,779
[SPEAKER_31]: That being said, I still don't

589
00:47:16,144 --> 00:47:23,447
[SPEAKER_31]: feel comfortable putting forward a motion for my fellow councilors to vote upon, having not seen the document in its entirety.

590
00:47:23,527 --> 00:47:35,392
[SPEAKER_31]: So I would motion to table this until our next regular meeting, and I will make sure that those first two pages that contextualize the data are included on the agenda at that time.

591
00:47:35,752 --> 00:47:43,075
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion to table by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Callahan, is this a table to a date certain of May 14th?

592
00:47:43,295 --> 00:47:43,435
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

593
00:47:46,717 --> 00:47:47,577
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please follow.

594
00:47:47,937 --> 00:47:48,517
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor CUMMING.

595
00:47:48,737 --> 00:47:48,917
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

596
00:47:49,258 --> 00:47:50,038
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice-President Collins.

597
00:47:50,098 --> 00:47:50,278
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

598
00:47:50,898 --> 00:47:51,658
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Lazzaro.

599
00:47:51,778 --> 00:47:51,998
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

600
00:47:52,358 --> 00:47:52,898
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Lovett.

601
00:47:53,158 --> 00:47:53,378
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

602
00:47:53,698 --> 00:47:54,119
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Stroud.

603
00:47:54,139 --> 00:47:57,879
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Stroud is temporarily absent.

604
00:47:59,139 --> 00:47:59,640
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Tseng.

605
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:00,320
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

606
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:02,660
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice-President Bears.

607
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:03,160
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

608
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,501
[SPEAKER_15]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

609
00:48:05,541 --> 00:48:07,901
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion is tabled to our next regular meeting.

610
00:48:07,921 --> 00:48:11,882
[SPEAKER_15]: 24-093, offered by Vice-President Collins and President Bears.

611
00:48:12,301 --> 00:48:14,803
[SPEAKER_15]: be it resolved that the Medford City Council express its support of S.

612
00:48:14,823 --> 00:48:15,364
[SPEAKER_15]: 1836 and H.

613
00:48:15,664 --> 00:48:28,355
[SPEAKER_15]: 2963, an act relative to the payment of the organizations exempt from property tax, be it further resolved that the City Clerk forward a copy of this resolution to the Medford Legislative Delegation as well as to the Chairs of the Joint Revenue Committee, Vice President Collins.

614
00:48:29,276 --> 00:48:30,557
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, President Bears.

615
00:48:31,458 --> 00:48:37,183
[SPEAKER_31]: So this is a motion to support the aforementioned bills that are currently in the State House.

616
00:48:38,085 --> 00:48:43,730
[SPEAKER_31]: I received outreach about this from several people that work with the Massachusetts Action for Pilot group.

617
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:57,963
[SPEAKER_31]: This comprises workers and representatives of various social service and educational, et cetera, workers from across the state, all in support of this legislation, which kind of comes up year after year.

618
00:48:58,456 --> 00:49:05,600
[SPEAKER_31]: The context for this is that currently in Massachusetts, large nonprofits that meet certain criteria are exempt from property tax.

619
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:10,182
[SPEAKER_31]: We have several of those here in Medford, most notably Tufts, my alma mater.

620
00:49:11,062 --> 00:49:19,967
[SPEAKER_31]: As an alumnus of Tufts, I've always felt my particular responsibility to advocate for changing that rule so that cities such as ours can implement

621
00:49:21,198 --> 00:49:32,229
[SPEAKER_31]: more fair, essentially compensation systems with these institutions that take up such a large footprint in our communities, but don't have to pay property taxes like everybody else does.

622
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:37,755
[SPEAKER_31]: So this bill would enable a local option that communities can choose to adopt.

623
00:49:38,203 --> 00:49:50,487
[SPEAKER_31]: that would require that these large nonprofit organizations pay really only 25% of the tax obligation that they would otherwise have to submit if they weren't tax exempt.

624
00:49:50,908 --> 00:50:02,652
[SPEAKER_31]: So it's really, in my opinion, it's not even going as far as it should, but so many of our conversations behind this rail are talking about the various infrastructural projects and personnel and services

625
00:50:03,186 --> 00:50:07,329
[SPEAKER_31]: that we ought to be able to provide to our residents that we can't because of a lack of funds.

626
00:50:07,989 --> 00:50:13,473
[SPEAKER_31]: So any action that this council can take to level the playing field, I think is a worthwhile one.

627
00:50:13,493 --> 00:50:28,883
[SPEAKER_31]: And I ask my fellow Councilors for their consideration in lobbying the state house to allow us to give us one more leverage when we're looking for fair compensation from these large, well-endowed institutions that we host in our community.

628
00:50:29,184 --> 00:50:29,424
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

629
00:50:29,878 --> 00:50:33,987
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Vice President Collins, and thank you for allowing me to co-sponsor this resolution.

630
00:50:34,548 --> 00:50:36,933
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been working on pilot since 2017.

631
00:50:37,013 --> 00:50:40,360
[SPEAKER_15]: We had many meetings with Mayor Burke in 2019.

632
00:50:41,792 --> 00:50:54,664
[SPEAKER_15]: The joint Our Revolution Medford, Our Revolution Somerville pilot working group released an estimate that if Tufts paid property taxes on its currently exempt properties, it would pay $8 million a year to the city, which is a significant amount.

633
00:50:55,685 --> 00:51:02,471
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the reasons that I've been working on this, and I worked with Representative Eiderhoven who filed this petition,

634
00:51:04,455 --> 00:51:12,420
[SPEAKER_15]: in 2022 was on a panel, we did some interviews to try to get the word out there about this.

635
00:51:12,821 --> 00:51:19,845
[SPEAKER_15]: This would only go up to 25% and it would only be 25% of what they would otherwise pay if they were not exempt.

636
00:51:20,546 --> 00:51:24,909
[SPEAKER_15]: And it would also exempt any organization whose assets were less than $15 million.

637
00:51:24,929 --> 00:51:29,052
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's not trying to go towards small nonprofit organizations.

638
00:51:29,112 --> 00:51:34,035
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really the large hospitals and educational institutions who do not pay their fair share right now.

639
00:51:34,576 --> 00:51:37,601
[SPEAKER_15]: So that would be $2 million more a year, and that was now five years ago.

640
00:51:38,042 --> 00:51:43,352
[SPEAKER_15]: As everyone knows, property values have gone up by a couple billion dollars since then, so I'm sure it's a little bit more than that.

641
00:51:45,208 --> 00:52:02,613
[SPEAKER_15]: In any case, the reason that it does not advance in the Statehouse is that Tufts and Harvard and MIT and many others pay hundreds of thousands of dollars each every year to fund an organization called the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities of Massachusetts, and they lobby the Statehouse to kill this bill every session.

642
00:52:02,954 --> 00:52:07,675
[SPEAKER_15]: So that is something we can all call, all of our representatives are supportive of it.

643
00:52:08,495 --> 00:52:10,736
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe Representative Barbara Garbally

644
00:52:11,283 --> 00:52:29,349
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe Representative Donato, I'd have to double check, and Senator Jalen, but this is an important thing, and as we all know, the state controls so much of what cities and towns are allowed to do, so that's why it's important that we advocate to the state to allow us to do more here.

645
00:52:29,829 --> 00:52:40,073
[SPEAKER_15]: There is also something that this council has submitted regarding Tufts, which is a lesser bar, it's something called the Institutional Master Plan Home Rule Petition, currently under zoning,

646
00:52:40,633 --> 00:52:51,543
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't have nearly as much zoning authority over Tufts as we do over other private property exempt institutions, have exemptions through something called the Dover Amendment.

647
00:52:52,423 --> 00:52:59,850
[SPEAKER_15]: We have asked that the State House give us the authority to require that Tufts tell us what they plan to do in terms of expansion and growth, a five-year master plan.

648
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:01,912
[SPEAKER_15]: That also has not advanced for

649
00:53:02,692 --> 00:53:18,528
[SPEAKER_15]: we've put it up every every session that I've been a city councilor that has also been quashed and we do that alongside Somerville as well who shares that concern so you know it really is the city working hard on this you know Tufts decided I think in 2021

650
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:22,431
[SPEAKER_15]: that they were going to unilaterally implement.

651
00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:34,374
[SPEAKER_15]: They said, we'll give you a pilot of $450,000, and we're going to give $450,000 to Medford, $450,000 to Somerville, and $450,000 to Boston, and we don't really want to negotiate with you any more than that.

652
00:53:34,774 --> 00:53:49,499
[SPEAKER_15]: So it is not sufficient in my view, and that's why I'm supportive of state legislation to give our city more authority to hold Tufts to pay its fair share to our community for the services that it uses that are paid for by the city of Medford.

653
00:53:51,331 --> 00:53:52,211
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further discussion?

654
00:53:52,651 --> 00:53:54,312
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Tseng, and then Councilor Callaghan.

655
00:53:55,412 --> 00:53:55,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

656
00:53:56,372 --> 00:54:00,454
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this has been really well described, so I'll be pretty brief.

657
00:54:00,934 --> 00:54:05,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, this is really asking big institutions like Tufts to pay their fair share in our city.

658
00:54:06,455 --> 00:54:14,678
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, these institutions, they use our police, fire, medical services, they use infrastructure, water, sewer, and

659
00:54:15,598 --> 00:54:20,580
[SPEAKER_03]: all we ask is for them to pay something a little closer to their fair share instead of $0.

660
00:54:22,481 --> 00:54:32,304
[SPEAKER_03]: The Massachusetts Municipal Association, which is a group that represents local governments from across the state, from across the Commonwealth, all 351 municipalities, this organization has asked

661
00:54:37,731 --> 00:54:45,256
[SPEAKER_03]: local electives like all of us to send in letters of support to pass resolutions on the City Council to support this bill.

662
00:54:45,796 --> 00:54:50,219
[SPEAKER_03]: And they believe that doing so will be important at the State House.

663
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:53,382
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I will very happily support this.

664
00:54:56,524 --> 00:54:56,724
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

665
00:55:00,532 --> 00:55:02,593
[SPEAKER_05]: As a city, we are a cash-strapped city.

666
00:55:02,993 --> 00:55:10,437
[SPEAKER_05]: There are many things, our water pipes, our roads, our schools, I could go on and on, that really require more funding.

667
00:55:11,798 --> 00:55:27,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Property taxes are one of the very few ways that we are able to raise any money, and it seems just not right to me that we ask every homeowner here to pay their property taxes without fail every year, and yet large organizations with billion-dollar

668
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:31,312
[SPEAKER_05]: endowments do not have to pay anything.

669
00:55:32,492 --> 00:55:45,461
[SPEAKER_05]: The 25% number, as I understand it, was gotten to because that is approximately the amount of services that they use of the city that we do not get any reimbursement for.

670
00:55:46,502 --> 00:55:51,185
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree that 25% is not enough, but at least it is something, and I'm in favor.

671
00:55:52,987 --> 00:55:53,228
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

672
00:55:53,288 --> 00:55:53,889
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further discussion?

673
00:55:53,909 --> 00:55:54,450
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpello?

674
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:55,492
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Council President.

675
00:55:55,512 --> 00:55:58,157
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Cohn-Springsteen.

676
00:55:58,397 --> 00:55:59,639
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, this is creative.

677
00:56:00,601 --> 00:56:04,909
[SPEAKER_17]: This is raising money to support our housing issues.

678
00:56:05,745 --> 00:56:07,346
[SPEAKER_17]: through the people in our community.

679
00:56:07,386 --> 00:56:10,208
[SPEAKER_17]: Isn't that great?

680
00:56:10,848 --> 00:56:16,932
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm gonna support this 1000% because this is what we're saying.

681
00:56:17,732 --> 00:56:25,036
[SPEAKER_17]: Because when we're talking with the last few weeks, last few months, the scary talk has really moved a lot of people in a negative way here.

682
00:56:25,397 --> 00:56:27,198
[SPEAKER_17]: So when you hear resolutions like this,

683
00:56:27,998 --> 00:56:34,920
[SPEAKER_17]: you see what Cambridge has to do for, what Harvard has to do for Cambridge when it comes to housing.

684
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:39,060
[SPEAKER_17]: You can see what Boston asked for housing with all their universities.

685
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:42,081
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is something that I agree with my colleagues.

686
00:56:42,141 --> 00:56:50,923
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we need to really, and especially as we see, I mean, they've, Tufts has just grown and growing and growing and

687
00:56:52,082 --> 00:56:59,005
[SPEAKER_17]: And all we keep doing is losing revenue, losing tax revenue, providing more services, costing our community more money.

688
00:56:59,045 --> 00:57:00,905
[SPEAKER_17]: So I support this wholeheartedly.

689
00:57:00,945 --> 00:57:01,265
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

690
00:57:01,726 --> 00:57:03,686
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

691
00:57:03,706 --> 00:57:05,007
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further discussion on the topic?

692
00:57:05,487 --> 00:57:06,567
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address for the record, please.

693
00:57:12,009 --> 00:57:16,051
[SPEAKER_29]: Louise D'Antonio, 41 Dartmouth Street, Medford, Mass.

694
00:57:17,572 --> 00:57:21,193
[SPEAKER_29]: It's nice to see that there's something that I agree with many of you on.

695
00:57:22,415 --> 00:57:23,456
[SPEAKER_29]: That's a move forward.

696
00:57:24,176 --> 00:57:26,438
[SPEAKER_29]: I had a question and then a couple of comments.

697
00:57:27,719 --> 00:57:42,889
[SPEAKER_29]: Is the state legislature talking about separating classroom, space, taxing, and the residential properties that Tufts, the university's own, like the multifamilies?

698
00:57:43,170 --> 00:57:50,875
[SPEAKER_29]: Have they made that distinction or it would be on the entire acreage of footage of the university?

699
00:57:51,644 --> 00:57:57,928
[SPEAKER_15]: So my understanding of it is that it is about what properties qualify for exempt use under state law.

700
00:57:58,329 --> 00:58:05,394
[SPEAKER_15]: The dormitories actually qualify for exempt use right now because they are for educational purposes, the housing of students for educational purposes.

701
00:58:05,814 --> 00:58:08,035
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the definition that applies currently.

702
00:58:08,856 --> 00:58:15,621
[SPEAKER_15]: My understanding is that at least the analysis and the legislation, if it were to move forward against the pay of the lobbyists,

703
00:58:17,002 --> 00:58:29,710
[SPEAKER_15]: is for all of the exempt purposes, and essentially the analysis that was done five years ago was asking the city assessor, what is the assessed value of all the land that is currently exempt from the property tax in the city?

704
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:33,432
[SPEAKER_15]: And then you just apply the property tax rate to that amount to get the figure.

705
00:58:33,852 --> 00:58:34,713
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you for answering that.

706
00:58:34,753 --> 00:58:50,003
[SPEAKER_29]: My comment is, having lived in Medford most of my life and having taught at Medford High School, I can say that Tufts has never been a really good neighbor, not to the people that live where the students are housed.

707
00:58:50,884 --> 00:58:51,724
[SPEAKER_29]: They have a lot of

708
00:58:53,925 --> 00:58:57,327
[SPEAKER_29]: information that they could funnel through to the schools.

709
00:58:57,988 --> 00:59:03,651
[SPEAKER_29]: They just don't seem to want to cooperate on on a day to day basis.

710
00:59:03,751 --> 00:59:12,457
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, they have facilities up there that could be shared not every day, but they really haven't been what we'd call a good neighbor.

711
00:59:12,497 --> 00:59:13,958
[SPEAKER_29]: They haven't extended themselves.

712
00:59:14,418 --> 00:59:15,279
[SPEAKER_29]: I think they offer

713
00:59:16,687 --> 00:59:32,570
[SPEAKER_29]: two scholarships, and this, I may be corrected on this, two scholarships for Medford High School students, Somerville High School students, I don't know about Cambridge, but they're a bit stingy with their resources, and I'd like to see them.

714
00:59:33,666 --> 00:59:34,647
[SPEAKER_29]: give us a little bit more.

715
00:59:34,727 --> 00:59:35,787
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you very much.

716
00:59:35,867 --> 00:59:37,028
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to add on that point.

717
00:59:37,528 --> 00:59:43,811
[SPEAKER_15]: Part of the bill would also right now, tough says that they provide community benefits to the city, but of course, they don't quantify those benefits.

718
00:59:44,852 --> 00:59:54,276
[SPEAKER_15]: This bill would also allow us to require them to tell us if you if you want to provide the money in cash, you know, if we would like to provide the money in cash for your brother, but we're happy to take community benefits.

719
00:59:54,296 --> 00:59:55,457
[SPEAKER_15]: You just have to tell us what they're worth.

720
00:59:55,977 --> 00:59:56,878
[SPEAKER_15]: So that it meets the amount.

721
00:59:57,078 --> 00:59:57,298
[SPEAKER_29]: All right.

722
00:59:57,318 --> 00:59:58,058
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you very much.

723
00:59:58,078 --> 00:59:58,379
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

724
00:59:59,799 --> 01:00:01,060
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address for the record, please.

725
01:00:02,793 --> 01:00:05,275
[SPEAKER_02]: William Duval, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

726
01:00:05,675 --> 01:00:17,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually like this bill as you do, but I wrote the author with one suggestion and it's one that you've heard before if you've been on the council for more than this term.

727
01:00:18,824 --> 01:00:27,270
[SPEAKER_02]: And that suggestion is that we continue to not tax the university's improvements, that's to say the buildings, but we don't give them any exemption at all on the land.

728
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:34,253
[SPEAKER_02]: And that could either be the way the entire bill is structured, or it could be an option that the city council could adopt.

729
01:00:35,593 --> 01:00:39,335
[SPEAKER_02]: It wouldn't discourage buildings going up on the land at all.

730
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:43,157
[SPEAKER_02]: They could build a dorm or an academic building, which we want to do to provide housing and jobs.

731
01:00:44,317 --> 01:00:51,681
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it would much better discourage the university buying up additional land because the tax of the land would be much higher than it is under the proposed bill.

732
01:00:54,032 --> 01:01:04,136
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it would actually wind up giving more revenue, but it would also encourage better behavior at the part of the university, and better align everyone's incentives.

733
01:01:04,516 --> 01:01:04,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

734
01:01:05,357 --> 01:01:05,757
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

735
01:01:07,898 --> 01:01:09,118
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address for the record, please.

736
01:01:12,959 --> 01:01:15,000
[SPEAKER_24]: Kelly Catala, 23 Salem Street.

737
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:15,981
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

738
01:01:16,961 --> 01:01:20,162
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, because this- Please direct your comments to the chair.

739
01:01:20,942 --> 01:01:21,963
[SPEAKER_24]: Through the chair, can I talk to

740
01:01:22,682 --> 01:01:23,343
[SPEAKER_15]: No, you can talk to me.

741
01:01:24,403 --> 01:01:29,807
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, this will help housing, because the universities are part of your housing problem.

742
01:01:30,708 --> 01:01:45,219
[SPEAKER_24]: They overcharge for their housing, they don't have enough housing, then their students end up moving into the neighborhoods, then because they're coming from wealthy areas that are willing to pay much more than what the people in Medford can pay, that raises the rents there.

743
01:01:45,639 --> 01:01:48,121
[SPEAKER_24]: Then they double up, they triple up, they quadruple up.

744
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:50,583
[SPEAKER_24]: If I look to the right side of the room, which I won't,

745
01:01:51,283 --> 01:01:53,886
[SPEAKER_24]: They all came to Medford because of universities.

746
01:01:54,126 --> 01:01:57,229
[SPEAKER_24]: They all came to Massachusetts because of universities.

747
01:01:57,650 --> 01:01:59,692
[SPEAKER_24]: They're coming here, they're staying here.

748
01:02:00,052 --> 01:02:03,076
[SPEAKER_24]: It's increasing the population that is part of the problem.

749
01:02:03,356 --> 01:02:05,738
[SPEAKER_24]: Not that we don't want you here, but it is part of the problem.

750
01:02:06,179 --> 01:02:10,483
[SPEAKER_24]: So if the university is gonna benefit, and I do believe Tufts just raised their tuition to $90,000.

751
01:02:12,165 --> 01:02:13,386
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not about the buildings.

752
01:02:13,466 --> 01:02:17,270
[SPEAKER_24]: It's the fact that they're increasing the cost of housing just by being here.

753
01:02:17,590 --> 01:02:21,214
[SPEAKER_24]: Mayor Menino was able to do a lot with the universities in Boston.

754
01:02:21,614 --> 01:02:25,218
[SPEAKER_24]: Harvard went to the city of Cambridge and they came up with a plan.

755
01:02:25,598 --> 01:02:27,160
[SPEAKER_24]: Cambridge is benefiting from them.

756
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,782
[SPEAKER_24]: I'd like to see Medford benefit on the housing end too.

757
01:02:30,002 --> 01:02:30,363
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

758
01:02:30,863 --> 01:02:31,264
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

759
01:02:31,284 --> 01:02:31,424
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

760
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:33,781
[SPEAKER_15]: Harvard does have an exemption.

761
01:02:33,961 --> 01:02:38,422
[SPEAKER_15]: Cambridge has an exemption for Harvard from some of the laws, which does help them access that.

762
01:02:38,682 --> 01:02:39,723
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's one piece of it.

763
01:02:40,303 --> 01:02:46,345
[SPEAKER_15]: And I will also note that the state is losing population and the fastest loss of population is between 20 and 40.

764
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:54,653
[SPEAKER_24]: When you look at the cost of housing and where the highest costs of being paid from, they're not from the people that have been here all their lives.

765
01:02:55,093 --> 01:02:57,855
[SPEAKER_24]: The people that have been here aren't being able to pay for it.

766
01:02:58,196 --> 01:03:00,598
[SPEAKER_24]: People are coming in, they're getting wonderful degrees.

767
01:03:00,918 --> 01:03:03,500
[SPEAKER_24]: The companies are coming in to get the young graduates.

768
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:07,884
[SPEAKER_24]: They're getting great jobs and they can afford to pay more than what most people are here.

769
01:03:08,244 --> 01:03:10,326
[SPEAKER_24]: Unfortunately, we have a lot of elderly people.

770
01:03:10,746 --> 01:03:15,591
[SPEAKER_24]: that need to go into housing, they're being told they need to wait five years.

771
01:03:15,872 --> 01:03:18,715
[SPEAKER_24]: There is a huge housing crisis, the university is a part of it.

772
01:03:18,775 --> 01:03:28,185
[SPEAKER_24]: In regards to Harvard University, they went to the city of Cambridge with a plan back in 2000, which I don't have all the statistics right in front of me because I didn't plan on going there tonight.

773
01:03:28,525 --> 01:03:33,230
[SPEAKER_24]: However, they helped the city of Cambridge produce and keep

774
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:36,452
[SPEAKER_24]: 2600 affordable units.

775
01:03:36,912 --> 01:03:40,534
[SPEAKER_24]: They don't give them money, they help leverage them the money.

776
01:03:41,334 --> 01:03:45,976
[SPEAKER_24]: That would be great if Tufts did that for Medford, that could help Medford, that would be a partnership.

777
01:03:46,496 --> 01:03:46,857
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

778
01:03:47,137 --> 01:03:47,557
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

779
01:03:47,577 --> 01:03:51,219
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address for the record, actually I'm gonna go to Zoom, Maureen on Zoom.

780
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:53,120
[SPEAKER_15]: Maureen, name and address for the record, please.

781
01:03:57,255 --> 01:04:00,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Zach and the rest of the board members.

782
01:04:01,238 --> 01:04:06,362
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to, first of all, touch on a couple of things that other residents brought up.

783
01:04:07,003 --> 01:04:10,365
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all... Your name and address for the record, please.

784
01:04:10,906 --> 01:04:14,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Maureen Dunham, 55 Ellsworth Street, Medford, Mass.

785
01:04:15,069 --> 01:04:15,349
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

786
01:04:16,289 --> 01:04:28,257
[SPEAKER_09]: So first of all, I want to touch base on what the former academic within the city mentioned, and that is the Stingy.

787
01:04:29,137 --> 01:04:40,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Two residents from Medford and two residents from Somerville that are one of thousands that apply for a full scholarship to Tufts.

788
01:04:42,063 --> 01:04:45,921
[SPEAKER_09]: When those candidates are not accepted,

789
01:04:47,880 --> 01:05:06,827
[SPEAKER_09]: We actually export them to other local state universities such as Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, my own son to Maryland, and we're losing a lot of the brightest bulbs.

790
01:05:08,327 --> 01:05:12,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Our own sons and daughters who are sons and daughters of

791
01:05:13,749 --> 01:05:18,151
[SPEAKER_09]: City of Medford, two outside universities, number one.

792
01:05:20,132 --> 01:05:37,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Number two, to touch on the infrastructure note that someone else made, I grew up in West Somerville on the grounds of Tufts University and have been a homeowner in Medford for the past 34 years.

793
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:40,381
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, as I go back and forth,

794
01:05:41,221 --> 01:05:50,010
[SPEAKER_09]: I noticed that the roads in Medford, not so much in Somerville, are in very poor disrepair.

795
01:05:50,891 --> 01:06:03,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Yet, when I cross over Boston Avenue and go through the side streets that are Tufts University property, I note that

796
01:06:05,049 --> 01:06:07,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Those streets are very well maintained.

797
01:06:07,331 --> 01:06:23,582
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know they're not maintained by the cities of Medford-Somerville because they've been bought and they're being used as non-for-profit housing,

798
01:06:25,254 --> 01:06:28,535
[SPEAKER_09]: university offices, et cetera, et cetera.

799
01:06:29,536 --> 01:06:36,339
[SPEAKER_09]: So another reason why I wholeheartedly endorse this move forward.

800
01:06:37,499 --> 01:06:48,944
[SPEAKER_09]: And secondly, I want to say that, oh, thirdly, I want to touch on the base that they use all of our emergency services and other services on a regular basis.

801
01:06:50,217 --> 01:07:12,047
[SPEAKER_09]: I have been going back and forth from Medford to Somerville, and on numerous occasions, I've seen students in housing, like three-family, two-family housing in Medford or in Somerville that are out on rooftops drinking and celebrating.

802
01:07:13,064 --> 01:07:16,445
[SPEAKER_09]: and having outdoor barbecues and fires.

803
01:07:17,445 --> 01:07:24,567
[SPEAKER_09]: And we all know where that leads to with the addition of a little bit of alcohol and immaturity.

804
01:07:25,267 --> 01:07:32,329
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's another reason why I wholeheartedly endorse support of this motion.

805
01:07:33,209 --> 01:07:34,350
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's all I have to say.

806
01:07:34,410 --> 01:07:35,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much for listening to me.

807
01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:37,210
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

808
01:07:37,230 --> 01:07:38,951
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address for the record, please.

809
01:07:39,531 --> 01:07:42,133
[SPEAKER_28]: My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.

810
01:07:42,853 --> 01:07:49,958
[SPEAKER_28]: Having served on this board some years ago, the city of Medford and Tufts University engaged in the pilot, a million dollar pilot program.

811
01:07:50,599 --> 01:07:57,944
[SPEAKER_28]: And the pilot program consisted of six students from Medford, six students from Somerville, who'd be able to go to Tufts University for nothing.

812
01:07:58,644 --> 01:08:06,430
[SPEAKER_28]: The million dollar cash part of the program consisted of three years of getting cash up front with the remaining portions of the money to be used for

813
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:10,754
[SPEAKER_28]: I think there could have been fire or police equipment here in the city of Medford.

814
01:08:11,334 --> 01:08:15,779
[SPEAKER_28]: Now that hasn't been followed through since, for what reason, I don't know.

815
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:25,869
[SPEAKER_28]: But the idea of taxing up to 25% relative to the nonprofit, whether it's Tufts University or someone else, I guess you haven't hit the dollar mark yet of where you're gonna go.

816
01:08:27,008 --> 01:08:40,773
[SPEAKER_28]: But speaking with leaders up at the State House, the one thing that the City of Medford hasn't done, as other cities and towns done, you have not moved to provide an amendment to the CPA tax, which would include affordable housing.

817
01:08:40,793 --> 01:08:54,198
[SPEAKER_28]: And as a result of that, and knowing that the Commonwealth now does not give back to the City of Medford from their surplus to the CPA, it's all going to be on cities and towns, excuse me, individually.

818
01:08:54,938 --> 01:09:03,727
[SPEAKER_28]: So I think the city of mid that has an opening over and beyond your 25% also to amend the CPA to now include affordable housing.

819
01:09:04,467 --> 01:09:09,532
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, you give it to churches, you've given it to schools into swimming pools and open space and land.

820
01:09:10,333 --> 01:09:19,200
[SPEAKER_28]: This is a great opportunity right now for you as a council, first term especially, to move forward on your reps and on your senators to make this amendment.

821
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:22,082
[SPEAKER_28]: You're not getting rid of the CPA, you're amending it.

822
01:09:22,442 --> 01:09:30,928
[SPEAKER_28]: And by amending it to put this inclusion in there, this will be your first step along with your 25% for the purpose of going forward to get your affordable housing.

823
01:09:31,489 --> 01:09:34,511
[SPEAKER_28]: The other part of affordable housing is very simple.

824
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:39,174
[SPEAKER_28]: What has the city of Medford, can you folks, any one of you here,

825
01:09:40,322 --> 01:09:59,314
[SPEAKER_28]: give an accounting of how much money has been used for affordable housing, where has the location's been, where is the land, and where has the working relationship taken place between a private contractor coming in with the city of Medford to provide affordable housing along with regular housing.

826
01:10:00,675 --> 01:10:02,417
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't think you have a big inventory on that.

827
01:10:02,617 --> 01:10:10,623
[SPEAKER_28]: And I think if you keep talking about affordable housing, you keep talking about the transfer tax, you keep talking about the registry, I think you should start there.

828
01:10:11,023 --> 01:10:19,891
[SPEAKER_28]: Because if there's nothing on the books right now, I think you need to get your feet wet in that particular area, get your base set up before you go into this next move.

829
01:10:20,251 --> 01:10:20,751
[SPEAKER_28]: 25% sounds good.

830
01:10:21,072 --> 01:10:25,015
[SPEAKER_28]: I think you need an inventory of all the property in the city method that's tax exempt.

831
01:10:25,035 --> 01:10:26,216
[SPEAKER_28]: And I'm quite sure you'll find

832
01:10:26,696 --> 01:10:30,919
[SPEAKER_28]: There are other pieces only on Tufts University where you can get that 25% from.

833
01:10:31,419 --> 01:10:31,759
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

834
01:10:33,701 --> 01:10:37,003
[SPEAKER_15]: Just to answer some of the questions, I can give you an answer to some of them.

835
01:10:37,943 --> 01:10:49,451
[SPEAKER_15]: The only properties that were owned by nonprofits with assets over $15 million were Tufts University's many properties, as well as the former, what was Harvard Vanguard.

836
01:10:49,631 --> 01:10:51,032
[SPEAKER_15]: That was purchased by Atrius Health.

837
01:10:51,550 --> 01:11:01,620
[SPEAKER_15]: which is a for-profit corporation, and that money, that building is now taxed, the Atrius Health building here, but that was another organization that had over the threshold and was paying a pilot.

838
01:11:02,156 --> 01:11:10,983
[SPEAKER_15]: And additionally, the Rivers Edge development was part of the Brownfields Mississippi Valley Development Corporation, and that was paying a pilot and is now moving to the tax rolls.

839
01:11:11,604 --> 01:11:15,126
[SPEAKER_15]: So those are the major nonprofits that were paying pilots.

840
01:11:15,327 --> 01:11:25,314
[SPEAKER_28]: But a few years ago up in Beacon Hill, before the 25% came into play, there was a percentage ratio that went, like I believe Tufts University at the time had a $30 million endowment.

841
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:28,957
[SPEAKER_28]: And there was a dollar amount that was set on the endowment that the school had.

842
01:11:29,878 --> 01:11:31,380
[SPEAKER_28]: as to what percentage it would go.

843
01:11:31,841 --> 01:11:33,643
[SPEAKER_28]: Now, Tufts doesn't have a large endowment.

844
01:11:33,663 --> 01:11:36,848
[SPEAKER_28]: It's not like Harvard University that's into the billions of dollars.

845
01:11:37,368 --> 01:11:43,937
[SPEAKER_28]: But there was a dollar amount, you may want to check this out once again, do your homework, go to Beacon Hill and find out what that legislation was.

846
01:11:44,438 --> 01:11:47,041
[SPEAKER_28]: Unfortunately, it didn't pass because as you said before,

847
01:11:48,402 --> 01:11:50,165
[SPEAKER_28]: Academy of colleges and universities.

848
01:11:50,565 --> 01:11:52,908
[SPEAKER_28]: But still, it's a stepping stone to go forward.

849
01:11:53,369 --> 01:12:04,885
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, and these are all pilot programs that you can look into, just because somebody is multi rich, like having I mean, Tufts University, you might find other locations where, you know,

850
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:10,322
[SPEAKER_28]: Listen, if you treat one one way, you got to treat them all the same way.

851
01:12:10,762 --> 01:12:15,324
[SPEAKER_28]: And it might be better to have a universal thing rather than go to the 25% and just go for the biggest one.

852
01:12:15,604 --> 01:12:22,547
[SPEAKER_28]: Because if you can work on all of them, maybe in the long run, you'll be able to get more in the long run than just grappling at the first one.

853
01:12:23,427 --> 01:12:26,328
[SPEAKER_15]: I was very supportive of the endowment tax that you're talking about.

854
01:12:26,728 --> 01:12:35,791
[SPEAKER_15]: And in terms of the affordable housing piece, the planning department does have the city's subsidized affordable housing inventory, the SHI, which is a list of all of the affordable housing units in the city.

855
01:12:36,212 --> 01:12:42,974
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's what we use to keep track of affordable units that are deed restricted, as well as making sure that we are meeting the

856
01:12:43,473 --> 01:12:47,496
[SPEAKER_15]: safe harbor requirements for 40 B. So that is maintained by the planning.

857
01:12:47,516 --> 01:13:06,490
[SPEAKER_28]: But what you don't have right now in your inventory, you might have that, which I can vote, but you don't have the physical ground locations with new and additional affordable housing can go in and working toward that with getting this money, whether it's again, the 25% of the affordable housing of the CPA money, whatever it might be.

858
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:07,151
[SPEAKER_28]: Understood.

859
01:13:07,171 --> 01:13:07,451
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

860
01:13:07,811 --> 01:13:08,131
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

861
01:13:09,492 --> 01:13:10,013
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Leming.

862
01:13:11,224 --> 01:13:14,286
[SPEAKER_18]: and just to say a couple things about the CPA.

863
01:13:14,326 --> 01:13:18,327
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm not sure where the 25% number came from.

864
01:13:18,388 --> 01:13:25,231
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe on the CPA, the minimum is 10% for open spaces, historic preservation, and affordable housing.

865
01:13:25,291 --> 01:13:38,937
[SPEAKER_18]: Now I understand that Cambridge requires 80% to go to affordable housing, but I believe that the reason that they do that is because they have money coming from other sources for historic preservation and open spaces.

866
01:13:38,977 --> 01:13:40,418
[SPEAKER_18]: So their operating budget is about

867
01:13:40,858 --> 01:13:52,229
[SPEAKER_18]: five times the size of Medford, they do have more money to throw around for, you know, building a playground or repairing a church or something like that.

868
01:13:52,609 --> 01:14:03,079
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think that the use of CPA money within Medford is a little bit different from the use of CPA money within other communities, especially Cambridge, which, again, has a lot more funds.

869
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:06,781
[SPEAKER_18]: And the same really goes with Harvard and Tufts.

870
01:14:06,801 --> 01:14:09,763
[SPEAKER_18]: So Harvard's endowment, like you were saying, is above $50 billion.

871
01:14:09,823 --> 01:14:11,324
[SPEAKER_18]: Tufts is $2.4 billion.

872
01:14:11,785 --> 01:14:16,468
[SPEAKER_18]: So when we're talking about money here, it's like Cambridge.

873
01:14:16,548 --> 01:14:23,632
[SPEAKER_18]: And I do admire a lot of what Cambridge has done with affordable housing, but we're really talking about another order of magnitude in terms of funding.

874
01:14:24,853 --> 01:14:25,314
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

875
01:14:25,454 --> 01:14:27,035
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to go to Martha on Zoom.

876
01:14:27,055 --> 01:14:28,596
[SPEAKER_15]: Martha, name and address for the record, please.

877
01:14:32,051 --> 01:14:34,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, hi, I'm Martha Andres.

878
01:14:34,412 --> 01:14:37,292
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm at 45 Kilgore Avenue in Medford.

879
01:14:39,133 --> 01:14:48,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for proposing this revisiting of the pilot payments that Tufts does.

880
01:14:48,695 --> 01:14:50,796
[SPEAKER_07]: I would encourage you, I've worked

881
01:14:51,701 --> 01:14:55,525
[SPEAKER_07]: for MIT, Harvard, and Tufts.

882
01:14:55,986 --> 01:15:00,531
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that they negotiate pretty hard on the community benefits.

883
01:15:00,791 --> 01:15:09,281
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the end of the day, if you are strong and creative, you will get community benefits out of them.

884
01:15:13,101 --> 01:15:30,352
[SPEAKER_07]: I would very much suggest that you base it, as a previous speaker said, not just on the police and fire and emergency services that they get from Medford, but on their impact on Medford as a community, on our housing.

885
01:15:31,883 --> 01:15:38,586
[SPEAKER_07]: our costs, and you ask them to be a real community partner to leverage what they can do.

886
01:15:38,686 --> 01:15:44,229
[SPEAKER_07]: They have not only money, but expertise, and they could do a lot more in Medford than they're doing.

887
01:15:44,389 --> 01:15:44,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

888
01:15:45,950 --> 01:15:46,350
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

889
01:15:46,370 --> 01:15:50,192
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to go to Mr. Castagnetti on Zoom.

890
01:15:50,252 --> 01:15:53,033
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address for the record, please.

891
01:15:54,814 --> 01:15:57,095
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, Andrew Castagnetti.

892
01:15:57,842 --> 01:15:59,003
[SPEAKER_23]: Cushing Street Methodist.

893
01:15:59,343 --> 01:16:02,164
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Councilor, President Isaac Beers.

894
01:16:03,005 --> 01:16:03,745
[SPEAKER_23]: Can you hear me, sir?

895
01:16:06,006 --> 01:16:06,587
[SPEAKER_23]: You can hear me?

896
01:16:07,227 --> 01:16:09,348
[SPEAKER_15]: Isaac Bruce Beers II, if you want to go all the way.

897
01:16:11,229 --> 01:16:12,790
[SPEAKER_23]: Isaac B. Zach Beers.

898
01:16:13,370 --> 01:16:14,131
[SPEAKER_23]: Can you hear me, sir?

899
01:16:14,751 --> 01:16:15,451
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, we can hear you.

900
01:16:15,471 --> 01:16:16,332
[SPEAKER_15]: Go ahead, Mr. Castagnetti.

901
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:19,834
[SPEAKER_23]: I could barely hear you.

902
01:16:20,814 --> 01:16:26,057
[SPEAKER_23]: Being a Woodstock graduate, I'm all in and I'm for taxing these

903
01:16:27,017 --> 01:16:34,741
[SPEAKER_23]: these nonprofits with their multi-billion dollar endowments, which supposedly they cannot touch, which to me is a bunch of malarkey.

904
01:16:37,502 --> 01:16:44,726
[SPEAKER_23]: On the other hand, have any of you Councilors heard of this entity called Walnut Hill Properties?

905
01:16:46,026 --> 01:16:46,326
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

906
01:16:48,347 --> 01:16:48,548
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

907
01:16:49,508 --> 01:16:53,230
[SPEAKER_23]: And can you basically tell us what it stands for and who owns it?

908
01:16:54,366 --> 01:16:57,628
[SPEAKER_15]: Walnut Hill Properties is the for-profit arm of Tufts University.

909
01:16:57,808 --> 01:17:01,169
[SPEAKER_15]: They purchase properties, but they are taxed on those properties.

910
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:03,611
[SPEAKER_23]: That's what I understand.

911
01:17:03,631 --> 01:17:08,113
[SPEAKER_23]: I was at a meeting 20 years ago with Michael McGlynn, and I think he was

912
01:17:08,863 --> 01:17:10,624
[SPEAKER_23]: He was the one that got this forward.

913
01:17:10,644 --> 01:17:22,307
[SPEAKER_23]: This is an entity of Tufts College, and it forces them to when they buy real estate, one family's 10 families doesn't matter to buy it on the Walnut Hill properties.

914
01:17:22,747 --> 01:17:29,109
[SPEAKER_23]: So we don't lose that real estate tax on off the tax tools, which is great.

915
01:17:29,329 --> 01:17:29,590
[SPEAKER_23]: You know,

916
01:17:32,821 --> 01:17:38,686
[SPEAKER_23]: So I don't know how much more tax you're gonna be able to get out of them, you know, with your proposition.

917
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:46,312
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

918
01:17:46,352 --> 01:17:47,012
[SPEAKER_15]: Anything further?

919
01:17:49,134 --> 01:17:55,359
[SPEAKER_23]: No, I wish you luck because we do take care of all the fire department apparatus stuff.

920
01:17:55,639 --> 01:17:56,439
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you for listening.

921
01:17:57,420 --> 01:17:58,281
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

922
01:17:59,946 --> 01:18:01,727
[SPEAKER_15]: go to Maureen D. on Zoom.

923
01:18:01,767 --> 01:18:07,692
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address for the record, please.

924
01:18:07,732 --> 01:18:11,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Maureen Donovan, 55 Ellsworth Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

925
01:18:11,995 --> 01:18:13,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a couple of more points.

926
01:18:13,896 --> 01:18:28,227
[SPEAKER_09]: The first one being that to counter their argument that they provide services to the city, cultural, educational, et cetera, I want to point out that most of those services are

927
01:18:31,921 --> 01:18:37,628
[SPEAKER_09]: are done by or accomplished by students, not the university itself.

928
01:18:38,209 --> 01:18:40,011
[SPEAKER_09]: They put out a program there and

929
01:18:43,476 --> 01:18:53,704
[SPEAKER_09]: such as daycare services, or a fair, or an educational service to the students and community of Somerville and Medford.

930
01:18:54,365 --> 01:19:05,674
[SPEAKER_09]: But the university doesn't really pay for the labor, because it's an expectation of the university that may be part of their culture that students give back.

931
01:19:06,314 --> 01:19:07,896
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's all free labor.

932
01:19:08,836 --> 01:19:22,539
[SPEAKER_09]: I also want to note that, on a second note, that Tufts is like, I hate to use this word, a vulture.

933
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:30,902
[SPEAKER_09]: And they are out there like vultures hovering over all the properties in the city of Somerville and Medford.

934
01:19:31,782 --> 01:19:31,942
[SPEAKER_09]: And

935
01:19:33,038 --> 01:19:42,461
[SPEAKER_09]: What they do is they go to the owners of these properties and they offer them money beyond what they could get from private enterprise.

936
01:19:43,162 --> 01:19:44,322
[SPEAKER_09]: And so they sell.

937
01:19:45,082 --> 01:19:51,405
[SPEAKER_09]: And then in turn, what happens if Tufts sells a property, which I doubt they ever will,

938
01:19:52,445 --> 01:20:00,590
[SPEAKER_09]: they won't pay a tax to the city of Somerville or Medford for selling over a million dollar property.

939
01:20:01,190 --> 01:20:02,391
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's wrong.

940
01:20:02,471 --> 01:20:08,954
[SPEAKER_09]: You expect the residents, hard working residents to do it, but not these non for profits.

941
01:20:09,755 --> 01:20:10,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and one more thing.

942
01:20:11,576 --> 01:20:16,398
[SPEAKER_09]: I do notice that Mass General Brigham has a few

943
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:22,644
[SPEAKER_09]: outlier facilities within the city of Medford.

944
01:20:23,425 --> 01:20:36,840
[SPEAKER_09]: And we know from reading articles about the Boston Globe and from hearing it on other media that they just keep reaping in the benefits.

945
01:20:37,621 --> 01:20:44,724
[SPEAKER_09]: and turning it into their own agenda, such as developing their own health insurance, et cetera, et cetera.

946
01:20:44,804 --> 01:20:55,188
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think this is a wonderful opportunity to make these billion dollar entities contribute to our city.

947
01:20:55,488 --> 01:20:56,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for listening to me.

948
01:20:56,689 --> 01:20:58,810
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

949
01:20:58,890 --> 01:20:59,910
[SPEAKER_15]: Go to Roberta Cameron.

950
01:20:59,930 --> 01:21:01,491
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address for the record, please.

951
01:21:09,255 --> 01:21:09,696
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

952
01:21:09,716 --> 01:21:19,149
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate this resolution and I appreciate all of the discussion that we've heard this evening about it.

953
01:21:19,490 --> 01:21:24,857
[SPEAKER_01]: The one small thing that I wanted to add to the discussion was that in considering the impact of the university,

954
01:21:25,558 --> 01:21:48,468
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking not only of the services, the municipal services that they use, and the students who live in off-campus housing throughout the community, but even more so, I think about the staff and faculty of the university who also need housing in the community.

955
01:21:49,068 --> 01:22:00,693
[SPEAKER_01]: and that providing sufficient affordable housing in any way that the university can contribute to that will really help to serve the university as much as it serves the community.

956
01:22:01,353 --> 01:22:02,074
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

957
01:22:03,074 --> 01:22:03,574

1001
01:24:23,333 --> 01:24:28,537
[SPEAKER_15]: From the Community Preservation Committee, dear Mr. President, the CPC has submitted one appropriation request for the below project.

1002
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:33,321
[SPEAKER_15]: The intention of this communication is to provide a brief project summary for the benefit of council members.

1003
01:24:33,581 --> 01:24:41,467
[SPEAKER_15]: Thomas Brook Park phase two, the CPC has previously recommended and the city council approved funding for the restoration of Thomas Brook Park, a project managed by the Metro Historical Commission.

1004
01:24:41,994 --> 01:24:48,897
[SPEAKER_15]: We are pleased that the Historical Commission has utilized the previous funding strategically and expeditiously and is now shifting into their final restoration phase.

1005
01:24:49,338 --> 01:24:54,300
[SPEAKER_15]: Thomas Brooke Park is located adjacent to the Medford Brooks Estate and contains the presumed location of the original Brooks House.

1006
01:24:54,780 --> 01:25:00,743
[SPEAKER_15]: The Historical Commission is rehabilitating the landscaping to create a functional recreational space while celebrating and preserving Medford's history.

1007
01:25:01,183 --> 01:25:05,005
[SPEAKER_15]: A portion of this funding will be spent cleaning up the tree and landscaping debris left over from previous work.

1008
01:25:05,444 --> 01:25:12,068
[SPEAKER_15]: The CBC supports this project and voted unanimously to recommend funding with one member abstaining, as they are a member of the Historical Commission.

1009
01:25:13,869 --> 01:25:25,215
[SPEAKER_15]: I will go to our Community Preservation Coordinator and the chair of the, vice chair of the Historical Commission, Teresa Dupont and Ryan Hayward.

[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address for the record, please.

1011
01:25:28,017 --> 01:25:29,618
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi, Teresa Dupont, 85 George P. Hassett in Medford.

1012
01:25:32,796 --> 01:25:33,797
[SPEAKER_25]: Good evening, councillors.

1013
01:25:33,917 --> 01:25:38,819
[SPEAKER_25]: I wanted to first thank you for the time to discuss this request of the Community Preservation Committee.

1014
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:47,284
[SPEAKER_25]: I am joined by Roberta Cameron, chair of the committee, as well as Ryan Hayward, co-chair of the Medford Historical Commission.

1015
01:25:47,945 --> 01:26:00,972
[SPEAKER_25]: So as you briefed there before you as an appropriation request to fund the next phase of the Thomas Brooks Park restoration, I want to allow Ryan and Roberta to share their comments as well, but I'll take this opportunity

1016
01:26:01,789 --> 01:26:10,653
[SPEAKER_25]: To quickly share that this project has been a multi-phase project that has been previously recommended by the CPC, as well as funded by this honorable body.

1017
01:26:10,673 --> 01:26:25,639
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, and some of the goals that have been identified in the phase, I personally think that will be really beneficial to the community as well as the residents of that immediate area, because it's going to bring some really nice amenities in the area.

1018
01:26:27,035 --> 01:26:34,745
[SPEAKER_25]: At this time, I guess I'll turn it over to Ryan if you wanted to give any further details on the project.

1019
01:26:36,087 --> 01:26:37,048
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't want to steal your thunder.

1020
01:26:37,969 --> 01:26:44,157
[SPEAKER_30]: No, I'll just be real quick to summarize and it's Ryan Heyward, 40 Sheridan Ave, Medford MA.

1021
01:26:46,459 --> 01:26:50,642
[SPEAKER_30]: So this is a second phase of work for Thomas Brooks Park.

1022
01:26:51,903 --> 01:26:58,808
[SPEAKER_30]: The first phase, of course, restoring the stone walls, Pompeii's wall, and conducting an archaeological dig.

1023
01:26:58,848 --> 01:27:08,735
[SPEAKER_30]: This next round, we're going to try to go back and continue with the archaeological excavations to confirm some additional findings on that site.

1024
01:27:08,755 --> 01:27:13,479
[SPEAKER_30]: We're going to be addressing the tree canopy and deadwood.

1025
01:27:14,399 --> 01:27:16,381
[SPEAKER_30]: We're going to put up some signage on the park.

1026
01:27:17,202 --> 01:27:30,734
[SPEAKER_30]: All of the openings that we made along the length of the park will receive curb cut adjustments, sidewalks, and striping to allow the pedestrians along the street to access the park.

1027
01:27:31,535 --> 01:27:35,679
[SPEAKER_30]: And then there's a little bit of extra funding in there for contingency, knowing how construction projects work.

1028
01:27:35,719 --> 01:27:39,182
[SPEAKER_30]: It's a little bit wild these days, and that accounts for the entire project.

1029
01:27:40,987 --> 01:27:41,567
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Ryan.

1030
01:27:41,607 --> 01:27:44,828
[SPEAKER_15]: We also have the chair of the community preservation committee, Roberta Cameron.

1031
01:27:44,848 --> 01:27:46,929
[SPEAKER_15]: Roberta, if you'd like to share anything additional.

1032
01:27:48,070 --> 01:27:48,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1033
01:27:48,650 --> 01:27:57,913
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to thank the council for supporting this park in the past with previous funding for the restoration of the wall and the design.

1034
01:27:58,613 --> 01:28:02,995
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm looking forward to seeing the implementation of the design in this space.

1035
01:28:04,636 --> 01:28:05,056
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1036
01:28:05,176 --> 01:28:06,556
[SPEAKER_15]: Any questions by members of the council?

1037
01:28:06,576 --> 01:28:08,617
[SPEAKER_15]: Council Vice President Collins.

1038
01:28:09,326 --> 01:28:10,166
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, President Bears.

1039
01:28:10,187 --> 01:28:15,590
[SPEAKER_31]: Just want to quickly thank, uh, manager manager DuPont Ryan Roberta for your work on this.

1040
01:28:15,610 --> 01:28:21,233
[SPEAKER_31]: I think this is one of those projects in the community, um, where the CPC is really successfully.

1041
01:28:21,893 --> 01:28:28,497
[SPEAKER_31]: Leveraged funding over several rounds to get us to this phase of the park improvements.

1042
01:28:28,557 --> 01:28:32,820
[SPEAKER_31]: I know this is something that community members, um, that abutters have really been looking forward to.

1043
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:36,262
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, so I would motion for approval after further questions and comment from

1044
01:28:36,735 --> 01:28:39,076
[SPEAKER_31]: my fellow councilors, but I'm really excited to see this progressing.

1045
01:28:39,256 --> 01:28:39,976
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you for your hard work.

1046
01:28:40,296 --> 01:28:43,578
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion to approve by Vice President Collins, seconded by Council Lazzaro.

1047
01:28:43,618 --> 01:28:44,398
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further discussion?

1048
01:28:46,579 --> 01:28:49,420
[SPEAKER_15]: Any discussion by members of the public in the chamber or on Zoom?

1049
01:28:54,682 --> 01:28:57,043
[SPEAKER_15]: Seeing none, on the motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

01:29:05,758 --> 01:29:06,018
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1059
01:29:06,919 --> 01:29:07,439
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Sagan.

1060
01:29:07,859 --> 01:29:08,119
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1061
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:09,960
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1062
01:29:09,980 --> 01:29:10,501
[SPEAKER_15]: I have the affirmative.

1063
01:29:10,541 --> 01:29:10,981
[SPEAKER_15]: None negative.

1064
01:29:11,021 --> 01:29:11,841
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

1065
01:29:15,704 --> 01:29:17,465
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion to revert to the regular order of business?

1066
01:29:17,905 --> 01:29:23,448
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a motion to revert to the regular order of business, seconded by my Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Leming.

1067
01:29:23,468 --> 01:29:24,209
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1068
01:29:40,230 --> 01:29:40,530
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1069
01:29:40,850 --> 01:29:41,090
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1070
01:29:41,110 --> 01:29:41,410
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1071
01:29:41,630 --> 01:29:41,811
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1072
01:30:13,531 --> 01:30:16,334
[SPEAKER_15]: 24-094 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

1073
01:30:16,354 --> 01:30:19,176
[SPEAKER_15]: It be resolved that the City Council discuss subcommittee processes.

1074
01:30:19,256 --> 01:30:20,057
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1075
01:30:20,297 --> 01:30:21,318
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1076
01:30:22,452 --> 01:30:25,253
[SPEAKER_17]: First of all, the council president and I did speak.

1077
01:30:26,113 --> 01:30:39,476
[SPEAKER_17]: Moving forward, I think that coming to professional opinions that putting in vague resolutions where it comes to discussion, we're going to try to make them more substantive.

1078
01:30:39,756 --> 01:30:51,099
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that whenever we do a subcommittee meeting or a regular meeting and we put resolutions in that are open-ended, I can understand that it's a little confusing, and I think that we can work on that.

1079
01:30:52,240 --> 01:31:04,990
[SPEAKER_17]: with this process, I think that understanding, it first started with the process with subcommittee that Councilor Leming proposed that with the newsletter.

1080
01:31:05,210 --> 01:31:08,833
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that understanding the process where it starts

1081
01:31:09,574 --> 01:31:23,837
[SPEAKER_17]: here and to a subcommittee and the subcommittee is the process is then sent to the council floor that we vote on something as a council to support or not support or share openly to the public of any concerns that we have.

1082
01:31:24,377 --> 01:31:25,637
[SPEAKER_17]: Has something changed since then?

1083
01:31:26,458 --> 01:31:33,439
[SPEAKER_15]: The council could of course authorize a committee to take action if it wanted to do so, but generally final disposition should occur on the council floor.

1084
01:31:33,982 --> 01:31:36,743
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so, and this is so people understand.

1085
01:31:37,323 --> 01:31:43,486
[SPEAKER_17]: I've gotten phone calls and they said, we don't see your names represented on this newsletter.

1086
01:31:44,206 --> 01:31:48,788
[SPEAKER_17]: And the issues I said that, well, I'm not, because I think that I had some concerns.

1087
01:31:49,248 --> 01:31:58,672
[SPEAKER_17]: And the concerns I had was not the fact that we're getting more information out to the community, but making sure that everybody, that there's equity involved.

1088
01:31:59,552 --> 01:32:17,662
[SPEAKER_17]: And we asked for some answers to the communications director, and he gave us some responses that really didn't equate to much, but still we have still yet vetted how we're getting the have-nots, the people that don't have an avenue to get our information.

1089
01:32:18,442 --> 01:32:19,923
[SPEAKER_17]: And where is our information going?

1090
01:32:20,993 --> 01:32:32,796
[SPEAKER_17]: it's going to the same people, the haves in our community, and they're getting the information that's designed by six members of this council, that I would question whether there is some violations.

1091
01:32:32,856 --> 01:32:40,358
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would ask legal counsel to report back to us if this is in violation of, you know,

1092
01:32:42,281 --> 01:32:42,821
[SPEAKER_17]: campaigning.

1093
01:32:43,542 --> 01:32:55,031
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think because we have six members that are on a slate that are putting out a newsletter that's going directly to an identified group of people that really isn't hitting the whole community.

1094
01:32:55,331 --> 01:32:59,194
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to the same list that all city communications go through.

1095
01:32:59,214 --> 01:33:04,779
[SPEAKER_17]: Sure, and I appreciate your opinion, but I think there's some issues that I really want a legal opinion on.

1096
01:33:05,139 --> 01:33:07,841
[SPEAKER_15]: By your logic, the mayor's communications would also be campaigning.

1097
01:33:08,041 --> 01:33:08,942
[SPEAKER_17]: So we should ask that too.

1098
01:33:10,243 --> 01:33:18,849
[SPEAKER_17]: So the key is really just asking these questions and having a set of solicitor, this wouldn't even have been a resolution, just a phone call and say, hey, I have a question.

1099
01:33:18,869 --> 01:33:21,791
[SPEAKER_17]: But because we don't do that, I have to bring this forth on the council floor.

1100
01:33:22,291 --> 01:33:23,612
[SPEAKER_17]: So I mean, that would be one.

1101
01:33:24,153 --> 01:33:32,939
[SPEAKER_17]: The second, which is more, that's really affected this community more than I think my colleagues even thought they could.

1102
01:33:33,860 --> 01:33:35,081
[SPEAKER_17]: Because over this past week,

1103
01:33:36,715 --> 01:33:47,840
[SPEAKER_17]: there was communication that was signed by my president and my vice president to state delegates about the transfer tax.

1104
01:33:48,940 --> 01:34:03,406
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's gone rampant that my fellow colleagues used their titles on a topic that we wanted to send to subcommittee that we have yet to talk about.

1105
01:34:06,155 --> 01:34:17,801
[SPEAKER_17]: The communication, the lack of communication, and the lack of putting forth this process of going towards subcommittee, it's something that we found so important to this community that hundreds of people were involved.

1106
01:34:18,982 --> 01:34:28,007
[SPEAKER_17]: And the feedback we got back from real people that have been here for years, that actually put this community on the map.

1107
01:34:29,028 --> 01:34:32,850
[SPEAKER_17]: I want you to understand, I get phone calls from people that told me, George,

1108
01:34:33,709 --> 01:34:50,600
[SPEAKER_17]: if no one's gonna listen to us, and there isn't gonna be the option that Councilor Callahan, they stress, put forth saying, this is just an opportunity to bring this to subcommittee to see what works and what doesn't, to see if we needed, if this is going to, and how we can focus and who we look at.

1109
01:34:50,620 --> 01:34:51,641
[SPEAKER_17]: Are we looking at developers?

1110
01:34:51,661 --> 01:34:52,562
[SPEAKER_17]: Are we looking at homeowners?

1111
01:34:52,762 --> 01:34:53,782
[SPEAKER_17]: Are we looking at seniors?

1112
01:34:53,802 --> 01:34:55,524
[SPEAKER_17]: Are we looking at so on and so forth?

1113
01:34:56,384 --> 01:34:57,125
[SPEAKER_17]: But we didn't do that.

1114
01:34:58,058 --> 01:35:05,283
[SPEAKER_17]: So these members of the community legitimately called me, and this isn't a political ploy or anything, I'm just sharing something.

1115
01:35:05,823 --> 01:35:20,853
[SPEAKER_17]: Good Medford people, backbone to this community, that said they decided that something what you think is sort of a political victory has now forced them to move on.

1116
01:35:22,254 --> 01:35:25,215
[SPEAKER_17]: And that to me is damaging to our community.

1117
01:35:26,036 --> 01:35:27,417
[SPEAKER_17]: It's still dividing our community.

1118
01:35:28,527 --> 01:35:29,388
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, don't get me wrong.

1119
01:35:30,609 --> 01:35:32,911
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody knows this is the political process.

1120
01:35:34,272 --> 01:35:42,019
[SPEAKER_17]: Six members of this community, this body, ran on a slate, were elected, and they have the decision in the final vote.

1121
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:44,441
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody has to understand that.

1122
01:35:44,841 --> 01:35:51,867
[SPEAKER_17]: So if people come up and wanna be angry and disrespectful and talk negatively and be angry, that's too bad, right?

1123
01:35:52,568 --> 01:35:54,049
[SPEAKER_17]: They didn't do what they had to do in November.

1124
01:35:55,711 --> 01:35:58,792
[SPEAKER_17]: But what I want you to understand, that these are real issues.

1125
01:35:59,612 --> 01:36:00,412
[SPEAKER_17]: These are real issues.

1126
01:36:00,432 --> 01:36:02,733
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is what, it's only a 2% tax.

1127
01:36:02,753 --> 01:36:03,453
[SPEAKER_17]: I hear that too.

1128
01:36:03,813 --> 01:36:05,714
[SPEAKER_17]: It's only this, but we heard it today.

1129
01:36:05,754 --> 01:36:06,494
[SPEAKER_17]: We heard it this week.

1130
01:36:07,494 --> 01:36:14,376
[SPEAKER_17]: Between the $3 to $6 million focus on getting our roads back to snuff, $3 to $6 million.

1131
01:36:14,396 --> 01:36:16,657
[SPEAKER_17]: We're talking about a $250 million new high school.

1132
01:36:21,823 --> 01:36:22,003
[SPEAKER_17]: right?

1133
01:36:22,243 --> 01:36:24,084
[SPEAKER_17]: We're talking about a rent control.

1134
01:36:24,464 --> 01:36:29,386
[SPEAKER_17]: We talked about a 2% transfer tax.

1135
01:36:29,707 --> 01:36:31,728
[SPEAKER_17]: We're talking about an override.

1136
01:36:33,048 --> 01:36:37,310
[SPEAKER_17]: We're talking about a CPA that the state isn't matching.

1137
01:36:38,110 --> 01:36:43,533
[SPEAKER_17]: And from what we see is really, they're not doing their share for affordable housing.

1138
01:36:45,274 --> 01:36:46,935
[SPEAKER_17]: So with all this, it's not just 2%.

1139
01:36:48,871 --> 01:36:51,133
[SPEAKER_17]: And what that letter says, it's pretty damaging.

1140
01:36:51,813 --> 01:36:53,855
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if you really thought it out when you signed this on.

1141
01:36:54,175 --> 01:36:56,397
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's- I signed the same letter in 2020.

1142
01:36:56,437 --> 01:37:13,510
[SPEAKER_17]: That'll bring me to the point where I'll ask for, through the clerk, I'll ask for a legal opinion that using city council titles and the correspondence to the state or other entities that gives the impression the information is offered as an official act of the city council.

1143
01:37:13,530 --> 01:37:17,633
[SPEAKER_17]: It specifically didn't, if you read the letter- Well, if that's something that, I'm cliche for you, but you're not my attorney.

1144
01:37:17,813 --> 01:37:24,760
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli, if you read the letter, there's a section that says signed on behalf of the board, and then there's a section that says signed on behalf of the individual.

1145
01:37:25,141 --> 01:37:27,443
[SPEAKER_15]: Our names were included in the section that said signed on behalf of the individual.

1146
01:37:27,483 --> 01:37:39,375
[SPEAKER_17]: So let me ask the question that we can, Mr. Clerk, through the chair, to ask legal representation if, by using it, no matter what line you put it in, but using your title

1147
01:37:40,456 --> 01:37:44,980
[SPEAKER_17]: By using your title, does that constitute what I asked?

1148
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,481
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you'd like me to send that to you, I will.

1149
01:37:46,861 --> 01:37:52,145
[SPEAKER_17]: But I, Council President, I respect you, but you're not the legal entity of this body.

1150
01:37:52,465 --> 01:37:53,246
[SPEAKER_17]: So I want that.

1151
01:37:53,266 --> 01:37:55,468
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that a motion to amend the paper?

1152
01:37:55,568 --> 01:38:01,673
[SPEAKER_17]: I wouldn't, if we could, I'd like to make that as a motion that we ask for the legal opinion on that.

1153
01:38:04,538 --> 01:38:22,584
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's a motion on the floor by Councilor Scarpelli to amend the paper to request a legal opinion on whether city communications are campaign communications and whether the use of city title, the use of titles by city officials, could you, what the use of the titles?

1154
01:38:23,025 --> 01:38:29,007
[SPEAKER_17]: So city council titles using correspondence to state or other entities, it gives the impression

1155
01:38:29,929 --> 01:38:34,152
[SPEAKER_17]: that the information is offered as an official act of the City Council.

1156
01:38:35,213 --> 01:38:35,393
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

1157
01:38:35,674 --> 01:38:35,834
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

1158
01:38:36,254 --> 01:38:36,494
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1159
01:38:36,774 --> 01:38:37,215
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you.

1160
01:38:37,295 --> 01:38:39,617
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to do want to clarify that that letter did not do that.

1161
01:38:39,837 --> 01:38:39,957
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1162
01:38:40,117 --> 01:38:40,377
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1163
01:38:40,457 --> 01:38:46,022
[SPEAKER_17]: But what I'm saying is you whatever line you put it in individually or not,

1164
01:38:47,549 --> 01:38:59,314
[SPEAKER_17]: It's it just doesn't it's it's it doesn't pass the smell test when you sit here and talk to hundreds of people and you express that this is a process that we want to vet it is right.

1165
01:38:59,774 --> 01:39:03,316
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we put out and what they what was what was said in that letter.

1166
01:39:04,315 --> 01:39:16,864
[SPEAKER_17]: was so damaging that it truly affected neighbors and residents that it's going to affect more than just the 2%, more than what was said, maybe 1% here, 1% there.

1167
01:39:17,265 --> 01:39:22,909
[SPEAKER_17]: The talk was 5%, and who would pay for it, and then so on and so forth.

1168
01:39:23,169 --> 01:39:33,137
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's a magnitude of issues on that letter that I think that as a body to even sign that, individually or not, it just gives out

1169
01:39:34,127 --> 01:39:38,548
[SPEAKER_17]: the look that this body truly doesn't want to listen to the residents.

1170
01:39:38,568 --> 01:39:40,509
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to clarify, what did the letter say?

1171
01:39:41,029 --> 01:39:42,509
[SPEAKER_17]: We can read it if you like.

1172
01:39:42,829 --> 01:39:43,749
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll send you a copy of it.

1173
01:39:44,090 --> 01:39:52,152
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I just wanted to see, because the letter that I signed, which I also signed four years ago, and I'm going to go to Councilor, Vice President Collins, then Councilor Collins, and then Councilor Lazzaro.

1174
01:39:54,744 --> 01:40:07,278
[SPEAKER_15]: I signed one four years ago, I testified actually in public in favor of the transfer fee February 2020 at the State House, signed the same letter, is requesting the authority to give cities and towns the power to make the decision for themselves.

1175
01:40:08,099 --> 01:40:10,923
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's what the letter said, and I'm gonna go to Vice President Collins.

1176
01:40:10,943 --> 01:40:14,306
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm not done yet, I haven't stopped, I'm still continuing to speak.

1177
01:40:14,947 --> 01:40:15,427
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, you're not done.

1178
01:40:15,507 --> 01:40:16,088
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, no, I'm not done.

1179
01:40:16,188 --> 01:40:16,288
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1180
01:40:16,488 --> 01:40:16,948
[SPEAKER_17]: No, thank you.

1181
01:40:17,348 --> 01:40:25,772
[SPEAKER_17]: So the other issue is that we're talking about, you know, the these communities that are involved in this tenure and this in this transfer tax.

1182
01:40:26,332 --> 01:40:35,396
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's surprising to see that these communities and I've reached out to local members of of council and elected bodies in these communities.

1183
01:40:36,096 --> 01:40:42,619
[SPEAKER_17]: And I find it amazing that for the most part, most of these communities that have that have signed on to this are

1184
01:40:43,619 --> 01:40:48,681
[SPEAKER_17]: vacation communities, communities that have housing for summer rentals.

1185
01:40:49,501 --> 01:41:12,168
[SPEAKER_17]: You have a few that you have conquered, possibly Somerville, Arlington, Cambridge, but then the rest are West Tinsbury, Wellfleet, Truro, Tisbury, Provincetown, Oaks Bluff, Nantucket, Edgartown, Amherst, Boston, Brookline, that's Chatham, Chilmark,

1186
01:41:13,803 --> 01:41:22,790
[SPEAKER_17]: These are towns that, for the most part, when you say that these towns, there are 17 cities and towns that are supporting this, you're sending out the wrong message.

1187
01:41:23,530 --> 01:41:28,574
[SPEAKER_17]: Because the reason those communities are out there is because of the development that goes on.

1188
01:41:28,814 --> 01:41:36,460
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, if this council truly said, let's focus on a transfer tax on developers for these properties, it'd be important to discuss it.

1189
01:41:37,961 --> 01:41:45,128
[SPEAKER_17]: But with that letter that was just signed on, whether it was two years ago, it was done again this week, that it sends the wrong message.

1190
01:41:46,129 --> 01:41:48,351
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, and I'll finish with this.

1191
01:41:50,273 --> 01:42:00,283
[SPEAKER_17]: When you look at what is being asked for and what has been discussed by this council over the last two months, and the monies that you're asking for,

1192
01:42:01,161 --> 01:42:07,183
[SPEAKER_17]: you're scaring homeowners, homeowners that I think that I don't think you truly understand.

1193
01:42:07,923 --> 01:42:10,263
[SPEAKER_17]: A million dollars isn't a lot of money.

1194
01:42:12,144 --> 01:42:18,105
[SPEAKER_17]: You raise your eyebrows, but a million dollars for a homeowner in this community isn't isn't a lot of money.

1195
01:42:18,886 --> 01:42:24,447
[SPEAKER_17]: And for the people that built these homes to a million dollars, they're hard working blue collar workers.

1196
01:42:25,467 --> 01:42:26,968
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you take that off the camera, please?

1197
01:42:27,878 --> 01:42:38,180
[SPEAKER_17]: You're talking about homeowners that built for nothing and using their homes for retirement for the most part, at least for the 300 phone calls and emails that I've received.

1198
01:42:39,641 --> 01:42:49,963
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, again, this is my opinion as a city councilor moving forward when we get it to subcommittees that we really spell things out so we understand the processes

1199
01:42:51,038 --> 01:42:57,483
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're not misleading community members that we're going to wait for the subcommittee that was so intense that we haven't had a meeting.

1200
01:42:58,403 --> 01:43:03,627
[SPEAKER_17]: We haven't had a meeting, but then my two fellow leaders, my council leadership here can sign off.

1201
01:43:04,748 --> 01:43:09,551
[SPEAKER_17]: And what I think is a violation using the title, but we'll wait for legal opinion.

1202
01:43:10,032 --> 01:43:10,312
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1203
01:43:11,325 --> 01:43:11,806
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1204
01:43:12,066 --> 01:43:20,436
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would note that many Councilors have signed many letters over many years advocating for the things that they care about and always have something to say on an issue.

1205
01:43:20,516 --> 01:43:22,959
[SPEAKER_17]: You have a lot to say really not from the chair, my friend.

1206
01:43:23,179 --> 01:43:25,101
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, you really violations are sir.

1207
01:43:27,273 --> 01:43:29,713
[SPEAKER_15]: Violations are the violations of telling the truth.

1208
01:43:29,833 --> 01:43:31,174
[SPEAKER_15]: So is that what the truth is?

1209
01:43:31,694 --> 01:43:34,354
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I'm my obligation as the chair is to state facts.

1210
01:43:34,434 --> 01:43:36,615
[SPEAKER_17]: You don't say facts.

1211
01:43:36,815 --> 01:43:38,535
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm incredibly disappointed.

1212
01:43:38,715 --> 01:43:44,396
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm disappointed that there are people who would miss our neighbors so that they feel like they need to move.

1213
01:43:44,556 --> 01:43:45,196
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's shame.

1214
01:43:45,256 --> 01:43:45,996
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm disappointed.

1215
01:43:46,016 --> 01:43:46,857
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Collins.

1216
01:43:46,877 --> 01:43:47,257
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1217
01:43:49,257 --> 01:43:50,277
[SPEAKER_17]: You're not following your rules.

1218
01:43:54,258 --> 01:43:54,578
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1219
01:43:56,311 --> 01:43:57,975
[SPEAKER_31]: I think we should take the temperature down.

1220
01:43:57,995 --> 01:44:01,624
[SPEAKER_31]: Just going to pause for a second.

1221
01:44:01,704 --> 01:44:02,667
[SPEAKER_31]: Let's take the temperature down.

1222
01:44:05,655 --> 01:44:07,956
[SPEAKER_31]: I'll start through the chair to Councilor Scarpelli.

1223
01:44:07,976 --> 01:44:14,938
[SPEAKER_31]: I appreciate you're bringing up the process for the newsletter coming out of the resident services and public engagement.

1224
01:44:15,078 --> 01:44:21,119
[SPEAKER_31]: Obviously this is our, that committee of which I am not a part is just piloting this process going forward.

1225
01:44:21,159 --> 01:44:26,561
[SPEAKER_31]: I agree it would also be more comfortable if that was brought to the floor and disposed of from there.

1226
01:44:26,701 --> 01:44:28,201
[SPEAKER_31]: I think that's a great note for going forward.

1227
01:44:31,846 --> 01:44:35,889
[SPEAKER_31]: this is a resolution about discussing the city council subcommittee process.

1228
01:44:36,189 --> 01:44:53,482
[SPEAKER_31]: And I just want to note that I don't really think it's in the service of giving people proper notice to weigh in on an issue that they care about, or transparency for us to be re-litigating a topic that is in committee, the committee that I chair, under a paper for which it was not brought up.

1229
01:44:54,422 --> 01:44:57,564
[SPEAKER_31]: So I don't think that- I'm sorry, I didn't understand that.

1230
01:44:57,585 --> 01:44:59,666
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, any comments on the transfer fee are out of order.

1231
01:44:59,886 --> 01:45:00,146
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1232
01:45:01,715 --> 01:45:02,536
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm going to finish my point.

1233
01:45:02,676 --> 01:45:06,260
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't think that we should let this turn into relitigating the transfer fee.

1234
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:18,632
[SPEAKER_31]: We are going to talk about that in committee so that residents and Councilors can be properly noticed about when the substance of that discussion is going to occur and come prepared, having thought about it and speaking about it.

1235
01:45:19,584 --> 01:45:23,308
[SPEAKER_31]: Through the chair to Councilor Scarpelli, I hope you know that I sincerely respect you very much.

1236
01:45:23,608 --> 01:45:31,276
[SPEAKER_31]: I've always enjoyed working with you, and I respect you enough to want to correct the record when things are being said that I think are a bad faith attack on my character.

1237
01:45:31,296 --> 01:45:35,721
[SPEAKER_31]: I think that anybody who's willing to engage in this in good faith knows that there is a difference between me

1238
01:45:36,341 --> 01:45:48,605
[SPEAKER_31]: as an individual, using my name and my title to speak as an individual, using my petition, signing a letter in support of something, being crystal clear, it's me as an individual endorsing something.

1239
01:45:48,685 --> 01:45:58,247
[SPEAKER_31]: I do that all of the time, on many platforms, on letters, on social media, and individual phone calls with various administrations saying I'm speaking as myself.

1240
01:45:59,248 --> 01:46:00,208
[SPEAKER_31]: Every councillor here

1241
01:46:01,556 --> 01:46:04,238
[SPEAKER_31]: Every Councilor here has the opportunity to do that.

1242
01:46:04,918 --> 01:46:06,239
[SPEAKER_31]: Some exercise it more than others.

1243
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:11,042
[SPEAKER_31]: Everybody in any role has an opportunity to say that, to say, this is the experience that I'm speaking from.

1244
01:46:11,062 --> 01:46:16,766
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm not speaking for my constituency, necessarily, when I'm signing a letter saying, I endorse this as a public official.

1245
01:46:17,787 --> 01:46:19,468
[SPEAKER_31]: This is concurrent with our public process.

1246
01:46:19,528 --> 01:46:24,371
[SPEAKER_31]: We are going to have publicly noticed committee meetings about the real estate transfer fee.

1247
01:46:24,872 --> 01:46:31,176
[SPEAKER_31]: At the same time, just like everybody here, I retain the right to say, I as an individual endorse that process.

1248
01:46:32,336 --> 01:46:35,857
[SPEAKER_31]: I also want to bring up, well, there's a lot to say about this.

1249
01:46:40,218 --> 01:46:50,141
[SPEAKER_31]: I think it's really regrettable that there has been so much consternation about, you know, this is a polarizing issue, and I get that.

1250
01:46:50,201 --> 01:46:53,902
[SPEAKER_31]: And maybe that's not even worth regretting, because polarizing issues are always going to be polarizing.

1251
01:46:54,442 --> 01:46:56,302
[SPEAKER_31]: And it's how we move on from that that's really important.

1252
01:47:00,453 --> 01:47:18,563
[SPEAKER_31]: I really take umbrage with the assertion that having some people in office who are supportive of one thing and other people also in office and also out of office who don't agree and going through that process of friction and tension and talking about it and arguing about it in public session

1253
01:47:20,874 --> 01:47:21,995
[SPEAKER_31]: I disagree that that's harmful.

1254
01:47:22,635 --> 01:47:29,618
[SPEAKER_31]: And I take umbrage with the fact that being in support of something that doesn't have consensus is harming this community.

1255
01:47:29,878 --> 01:47:35,461
[SPEAKER_31]: We are going to talk about this in public session, as we have been doing, until it gets to the time we're going to put it to a vote.

1256
01:47:35,881 --> 01:47:48,106
[SPEAKER_31]: And when we put it to a vote, I want to remind everybody, what we put to a vote is simply asking the state for the authority to again meet in public session to deliberate on what we should do as a community.

1257
01:47:50,342 --> 01:47:52,604
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't believe that perception is reality, actually.

1258
01:47:53,124 --> 01:47:59,608
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think that when people are telling us how something should make us feel, we should follow the money.

1259
01:48:00,929 --> 01:48:12,877
[SPEAKER_31]: And I hope that, I know we're gonna continue to talk about these issues in committee, these polarizing issues, these issues that leave many of us feeling extremely passionate.

1260
01:48:14,974 --> 01:48:23,078
[SPEAKER_31]: but I think we should all come with our own opinions and a mutual respect and an unwillingness to believe that anybody in the room is out to get the other person.

1261
01:48:23,778 --> 01:48:29,140
[SPEAKER_31]: And whoever's telling you that somebody in the room is out to get the other person, they're probably wrong, because we all live here.

1262
01:48:29,961 --> 01:48:30,221
[SPEAKER_31]: Thanks.

1263
01:48:32,302 --> 01:48:32,902
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1264
01:48:33,222 --> 01:48:37,684
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Callahan, Councilor Lazzaro, Vice President, sorry, Councilor Leming.

1265
01:48:38,025 --> 01:48:39,025
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Callahan first.

1266
01:48:42,327 --> 01:48:43,307
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe I did it.

1267
01:48:45,581 --> 01:48:46,252
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, councillors are.

1268
01:48:50,949 --> 01:48:51,689
[SPEAKER_06]: I had raised my hand earlier.

1269
01:48:51,949 --> 01:48:52,390
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't matter.

1270
01:48:53,890 --> 01:49:13,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli, I appreciate you mentioning something about the Resident Services Committee, that you had voiced the same concerns during that meeting, but then you had left the Zoom and didn't hear our responses, but I had offered to bring that paper to the regular meeting.

1271
01:49:13,576 --> 01:49:17,497
[SPEAKER_06]: It did not get a second, and it didn't get voted to come to the regular meeting, so it didn't pass.

1272
01:49:18,337 --> 01:49:27,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I also offered to, uh, speak with our director of diversity, equity and inclusion, which did that motion did pass.

1273
01:49:27,208 --> 01:49:33,936
[SPEAKER_06]: And I spoke with her today about ways that we can best, um, take advantage of

1274
01:49:34,798 --> 01:49:55,438
[SPEAKER_06]: her and her expertise and our affinity groups and our different opportunities in the city to make sure that we're taking advantage of all the resources that we have at our disposal to make sure that the newsletter is reaching our residents to the best of our abilities.

1275
01:49:55,458 --> 01:49:57,439
[SPEAKER_06]: A few things that she mentioned were

1276
01:50:00,583 --> 01:50:08,732
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand the intention of the newsletters to be emailed, but also that we could have paper copies and we can bring them to events.

1277
01:50:08,812 --> 01:50:12,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we can distribute them along with the listening sessions once those are off the ground.

1278
01:50:13,234 --> 01:50:29,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and then, um, something director noise I mentioned is, uh, bringing bringing paper copies to things like the Haitian flag ceremony that's coming up May 18th and meeting communities where they already are instead of requesting that folks come to us.

1279
01:50:30,105 --> 01:50:33,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Um so that's something that we discussed, but I would intend to

1280
01:50:41,189 --> 01:50:49,435
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would also reiterate what Vice President Collins says and hope that we can keep our comments on this to what's on the agenda.

1281
01:50:50,616 --> 01:50:55,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1282
01:50:55,720 --> 01:51:05,688
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to say, I am trying to understand how we can be discussing the transfer fee when it is not on the agenda.

1283
01:51:07,438 --> 01:51:21,228
[SPEAKER_05]: And I implore the chair to limit discussion to what is on the agenda, because people need to be noticed publicly so that everyone knows what is on the agenda and what we are discussing.

1284
01:51:22,129 --> 01:51:26,312
[SPEAKER_05]: This can't be a body where you put something completely vague on the agenda.

1285
01:51:26,753 --> 01:51:32,477
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have to say, when I read this, I had no idea what was going to be discussed.

1286
01:51:35,925 --> 01:51:43,567
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to know, and the public needs to know, what is on the agenda, so that people who are interested in talking about that topic can come.

1287
01:51:44,187 --> 01:51:56,491
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I spoke with Councilor Scarpelli about that, and I believe we are amending this to have some substance, but in the future, if there are motions to discuss in a vague way, I probably will rule them out of order.

1288
01:51:58,451 --> 01:52:00,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Second, I would like to say

1289
01:52:17,603 --> 01:52:17,963
[SPEAKER_05]: back to me.

1290
01:52:21,206 --> 01:52:21,866
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, thank you.

1291
01:52:22,246 --> 01:52:26,970
[SPEAKER_18]: I would like to emphasize the point that there was a motion that Councilor Tseng was absent.

1292
01:52:27,030 --> 01:52:28,491
[SPEAKER_18]: He was on vacation at the moment.

1293
01:52:29,251 --> 01:52:35,956
[SPEAKER_18]: So there are four people of the five committee members of the most recent Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee Councilors Scarpelli through the chair.

1294
01:52:36,517 --> 01:52:43,902
[SPEAKER_18]: You let your objections to the newsletter be known, which were you consistently let everybody on this body note since we've been discussing the newsletter.

1295
01:52:44,662 --> 01:52:44,742
[SPEAKER_18]: Um.

1296
01:52:45,603 --> 01:52:50,428
[SPEAKER_18]: But then at 8 34 PM, you then left the meeting without notifying anybody.

1297
01:52:51,148 --> 01:52:56,894
[SPEAKER_18]: And because of that, like I was chair, so I didn't think it was appropriate to second motion from the chair.

1298
01:52:57,494 --> 01:53:09,766
[SPEAKER_18]: And obviously, Councilor Callahan disagreed with the motion to send it to the regular, um, to the floor because there was the opinion that the perfect cannot, uh,

1299
01:53:10,510 --> 01:53:16,473
[SPEAKER_18]: be good, can't be the enemy of the perfect, whichever way that goes, and that we needed to get a newsletter out in a timely way.

1300
01:53:17,213 --> 01:53:22,576
[SPEAKER_18]: If you had decided to stay at the meeting and attend these meetings consistently, we would be debating this at the floor.

1301
01:53:22,596 --> 01:53:24,157
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor, if you could just share your comments with the chair.

1302
01:53:24,737 --> 01:53:25,157
[SPEAKER_18]: Apologies.

1303
01:53:26,258 --> 01:53:37,343
[SPEAKER_18]: If Councilor Scriabelli had decided to stay at the meeting and hear the rest of the discussion, then we would be voting on the newsletter on the floor right now, and I hope that in the future, resident services and public engagement committees

1304
01:53:37,827 --> 01:53:39,349
[SPEAKER_18]: We can do that second.

1305
01:53:39,369 --> 01:53:52,846
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that it just in response to some of the discussion about public fear and outrage in response to some of these, I would like to point out that a lot of the more recent

1306
01:53:54,468 --> 01:54:08,398
[SPEAKER_18]: concerns and emails that we've been seeing were the result of a text sent around to many other, to most residents in the city, or a huge number of them from the Greater Boston Real Estate Board, which has obviously consistently opposed these measures in other cities.

1307
01:54:08,619 --> 01:54:13,022
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think that that should be noted.

1308
01:54:13,743 --> 01:54:14,023
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1309
01:54:14,163 --> 01:54:14,623
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1310
01:54:14,683 --> 01:54:15,864
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, if I can.

1311
01:54:16,725 --> 01:54:17,525
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Callahan.

1312
01:54:18,206 --> 01:54:20,768
[SPEAKER_17]: Directly, he used my name, so I would point of personal privilege.

1313
01:54:21,752 --> 01:54:23,693
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to go to Councilor Callahan, if I may.

1314
01:54:27,596 --> 01:54:28,017
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1315
01:54:31,139 --> 01:54:36,323
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to just make a comment that it seems that people do misunderstand the subcommittee process.

1316
01:54:38,405 --> 01:54:43,829
[SPEAKER_05]: So, since this is what is on the agenda, I would like to discuss the subcommittee process.

1317
01:54:44,729 --> 01:54:49,013
[SPEAKER_05]: That is, that when we are going to begin to discuss

1318
01:54:50,382 --> 01:55:01,726
[SPEAKER_05]: some piece of legislation, for example, that before we can come in with all the wording ready, set, go, we have to give it a paper number.

1319
01:55:02,486 --> 01:55:07,048
[SPEAKER_05]: So we bring it to this body for it to get a paper number so that it can be discussed in committee.

1320
01:55:10,789 --> 01:55:12,570
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the way that we do things.

1321
01:55:13,530 --> 01:55:15,071
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it will be discussed in committee.

1322
01:55:15,311 --> 01:55:17,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Committees are open to the public.

1323
01:55:17,191 --> 01:55:18,672
[SPEAKER_05]: They are held right here in this room.

1324
01:55:19,753 --> 01:55:31,337
[SPEAKER_05]: any member of the public may come, they may be part just as in city council meetings, they can be part of the discussion where we craft the language together as a community.

1325
01:55:32,517 --> 01:55:38,159
[SPEAKER_05]: That may take one committee meeting, it may take more than one committee meeting.

1326
01:55:39,439 --> 01:55:48,202
[SPEAKER_05]: It will then, especially if it is an ordinance or some larger piece, it will be required to have three hearings, three readings.

1327
01:55:51,693 --> 01:55:54,914
[SPEAKER_05]: here at the city council meeting.

1328
01:55:56,215 --> 01:56:07,439
[SPEAKER_05]: So I am somewhat confused as to why what was said that was my description that this was the beginning of a process is being questioned.

1329
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:14,482
[SPEAKER_05]: It is definitely the beginning of a, this is what subcommittee, subcommittee, but committee process is about.

1330
01:56:14,863 --> 01:56:18,204
[SPEAKER_05]: You get a paper number, it goes to committee, it gets discussed openly,

1331
01:56:18,644 --> 01:56:26,693
[SPEAKER_05]: with the public in committee, that is where language can be drafted, and then it comes to this body, and there are still public hearings in this body.

1332
01:56:29,916 --> 01:56:35,802
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, every item discussed by the City Council is discussed in multiple public meetings with the participation of the public.

1333
01:56:35,983 --> 01:56:38,125
[SPEAKER_17]: So I thank Councilor Callahan.

1334
01:56:38,817 --> 01:56:39,418
[SPEAKER_17]: Point taken.

1335
01:56:40,098 --> 01:56:41,179
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for answering my question.

1336
01:56:41,880 --> 01:56:46,164
[SPEAKER_17]: The question I had was the process subcommittee for the newsletter.

1337
01:56:46,825 --> 01:56:47,485
[SPEAKER_17]: It got its number.

1338
01:56:47,926 --> 01:56:48,466
[SPEAKER_17]: It was vetted.

1339
01:56:49,387 --> 01:56:51,389
[SPEAKER_17]: It comes to then the body that we vote on it.

1340
01:56:52,109 --> 01:56:56,253
[SPEAKER_17]: And then once it's agreed with the community, a newsletter is then released, correct?

1341
01:56:57,130 --> 01:56:57,890
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the process.

1342
01:56:58,211 --> 01:56:59,631
[SPEAKER_17]: Was the process followed, Councilor?

1343
01:56:59,932 --> 01:57:00,372
[SPEAKER_05]: It was not.

1344
01:57:00,512 --> 01:57:01,012
[SPEAKER_05]: It was not.

1345
01:57:01,393 --> 01:57:03,094
[SPEAKER_17]: So I appreciate that.

1346
01:57:03,194 --> 01:57:05,375
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is what the conversation was.

1347
01:57:05,915 --> 01:57:12,819
[SPEAKER_17]: And for what I left, I think I've been very vocal in understanding I do the best I can on Wednesday nights.

1348
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:14,840
[SPEAKER_17]: I've expressed that to the president.

1349
01:57:15,741 --> 01:57:16,942
[SPEAKER_17]: I do have another job.

1350
01:57:17,242 --> 01:57:18,563
[SPEAKER_17]: As a matter of fact, I have two other jobs.

1351
01:57:19,063 --> 01:57:22,005
[SPEAKER_17]: And I do the best I can to stay to every meet at Council Leming.

1352
01:57:23,185 --> 01:57:25,467
[SPEAKER_17]: But on Wednesday nights, as Councilor Bears can attest,

1353
01:57:26,437 --> 01:57:28,819
[SPEAKER_17]: I do the best I can to stay as long as I can.

1354
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:38,185
[SPEAKER_17]: And to point me out that I left at a certain time, I gave my opinion, and then I had to go close the program.

1355
01:57:39,166 --> 01:57:49,193
[SPEAKER_17]: So to that point, I've asked the council president to please look for other evenings other than Wednesday nights, so I can stay at all the meetings.

1356
01:57:49,413 --> 01:57:51,494
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, I don't have to miss a meeting, because I missed one.

1357
01:57:52,455 --> 01:57:53,556
[SPEAKER_17]: I missed the one prior to this.

1358
01:57:55,060 --> 01:57:56,401
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I stayed as long as I could.

1359
01:57:58,003 --> 01:58:03,689
[SPEAKER_17]: And I appreciate the discussion that happened after that, but that's common practice.

1360
01:58:04,430 --> 01:58:04,950
[SPEAKER_17]: That happens.

1361
01:58:05,270 --> 01:58:05,971
[SPEAKER_17]: You've missed meetings.

1362
01:58:06,852 --> 01:58:07,633
[SPEAKER_17]: We've missed meetings.

1363
01:58:07,673 --> 01:58:08,414
[SPEAKER_17]: We've left meetings.

1364
01:58:10,916 --> 01:58:18,720
[SPEAKER_17]: The process I bring this forward on your situation and your resolution is that what Councilor Callahan said is what is an issue.

1365
01:58:19,200 --> 01:58:22,001
[SPEAKER_17]: A subcommittee gets a number, we discuss it.

1366
01:58:22,762 --> 01:58:25,963
[SPEAKER_17]: Long as it takes, we make a vote to send this to the council.

1367
01:58:26,844 --> 01:58:29,805
[SPEAKER_17]: To the council, we then vote and then we act.

1368
01:58:30,285 --> 01:58:30,886
[SPEAKER_17]: You didn't do that.

1369
01:58:34,531 --> 01:58:36,913
[SPEAKER_17]: You didn't do that, Councilor Bears, through the Chair, to Councilor Leming.

1370
01:58:37,353 --> 01:58:37,934
[SPEAKER_17]: You didn't do that.

1371
01:58:38,414 --> 01:58:41,217
[SPEAKER_17]: So I appreciate that bringing forward, because it's true, that's what happened.

1372
01:58:41,697 --> 01:59:01,315
[SPEAKER_17]: And then to Councilor Collins, through the Chair, to be vague and to be deceiving, not my intention, didn't know how to bring this forward, no different than her first meeting, Councilor Bears, through the Chair, when we talked about, quote unquote,

1373
01:59:02,489 --> 01:59:05,035
[SPEAKER_17]: The description of our subcommittee was on what?

1374
01:59:05,837 --> 01:59:07,742
[SPEAKER_17]: Home rule petitions, very vague.

1375
01:59:08,567 --> 01:59:09,788
[SPEAKER_15]: I can read the full text of that.

1376
01:59:09,848 --> 01:59:11,349
[SPEAKER_17]: Very vague home rule petition.

1377
01:59:11,389 --> 01:59:14,390
[SPEAKER_15]: So when we saw that, if I could read the full text.

1378
01:59:14,691 --> 01:59:15,811
[SPEAKER_31]: Wait, can I interject really quickly?

1379
01:59:16,231 --> 01:59:16,892
[SPEAKER_15]: No, hold on a minute.

1380
01:59:16,932 --> 01:59:19,293
[SPEAKER_31]: No, Councilor Scarpelli, I didn't mean that you were being deceitful.

1381
01:59:19,493 --> 01:59:22,435
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, well, I can read the full text.

1382
01:59:22,455 --> 01:59:35,823
[SPEAKER_15]: The February 14th Planning and Permitting Committee meeting, 22-310, housing home rule petitions offered by Vice President Bears and Councilor Collins, whereas the city of Medford and greater Boston region are in the midst of a deep housing crisis that is displacing residents and families.

1383
01:59:36,403 --> 02:00:02,806
[SPEAKER_15]: and whereas the City of Medford saw a 15% year-over-year increase in average rents from March 2021 to March 2022, and a 5% increase in average rents from February 22 to March 2022, according to WGBH News, and whereas many Medford residents are facing significant rent increase or other methods of displacement from rental units, now, therefore, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the Housing Subcommittee meet to discuss the potential drafting of home rule petitions on the following policies to protect Medford residents facing housing instability,

1384
02:00:03,346 --> 02:00:16,957
[SPEAKER_15]: and a lack of affordable housing options, bullet point rent stabilization, tenant right to purchase, tenant right to counsel, just cause eviction protections, regulation of upfront lease fees, anti-price housing protections, and exemptions for small owner-occupant landlords.

1385
02:00:17,537 --> 02:00:28,626
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it further resolved that the housing subcommittee discuss a potential council resolution supporting H1378 and S886, an act enabling local options for tenant protections currently under consideration by the Massachusetts legislature.

1386
02:00:28,686 --> 02:00:30,508
[SPEAKER_15]: So it was a pretty specific notice.

1387
02:00:30,976 --> 02:00:43,124
[SPEAKER_17]: So when we talk about these concerns and issues, when we talk about subcommittees, and we talk about subcommittees that are in session that we're not talking about, and they're not being they're not being brought forth yet.

1388
02:00:44,965 --> 02:00:51,990
[SPEAKER_17]: When the community sees a concern, and they bring it forth to me, and

1389
02:00:54,639 --> 02:01:01,924
[SPEAKER_17]: that they're nervous for the fact that the process that they thought was mentioned that evening wasn't followed through.

1390
02:01:05,787 --> 02:01:11,751
[SPEAKER_17]: I looked at this as a process to speak on it so they understood the process as we move forward.

1391
02:01:13,092 --> 02:01:23,360
[SPEAKER_17]: So as we move forward with the subcommittee process on the transfer tax, understand what phone calls I got, the emails I got, the people that talked to me on the street,

1392
02:01:24,807 --> 02:01:25,567
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is done.

1393
02:01:25,647 --> 02:01:26,387
[SPEAKER_17]: I said, what is done?

1394
02:01:26,987 --> 02:01:27,848
[SPEAKER_17]: No, it's not done.

1395
02:01:28,388 --> 02:01:34,249
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, this letter says everything that we fear about, everything that we were nervous about that evening.

1396
02:01:36,569 --> 02:01:47,751
[SPEAKER_17]: So to one councilor's point of view, as this being dividing and this is being hurtful, you have hundreds of people that felt that night that they weren't listened to.

1397
02:01:48,771 --> 02:01:52,772
[SPEAKER_17]: And then with the delay and not talking about an issue that was a pretty hot topic,

1398
02:01:54,383 --> 02:02:02,268
[SPEAKER_17]: and then not being brought forth and then this letter going out publicly, it put people in a different way.

1399
02:02:04,229 --> 02:02:09,613
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's my responsibility as a council to try to put this forward so we can discuss it, so we can move forward with it.

1400
02:02:11,194 --> 02:02:12,535
[SPEAKER_17]: So if at any time

1401
02:02:14,619 --> 02:02:25,550
[SPEAKER_17]: that you say something to me that's hurtful, and I say something to you that's hurtful, we know each other personally to understand that I know you have a job to do, and you're representing people that have come to you directly.

1402
02:02:25,950 --> 02:02:26,611
[SPEAKER_17]: That's all I'm doing.

1403
02:02:29,273 --> 02:02:32,937
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm telling you, it is scary to people.

1404
02:02:34,434 --> 02:02:40,036
[SPEAKER_17]: It's scary to people that when I, it's not that it is scary people to the point that they are.

1405
02:02:40,256 --> 02:02:44,978
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's what I just, you need to share that as part of this lack of subcommittee process.

1406
02:02:45,658 --> 02:02:48,119
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, appreciate our talk earlier.

1407
02:02:48,439 --> 02:02:58,422
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll make sure moving forward as we move forward with these, our resolutions that I will eliminate discussion and I'll be more detailed for the body.

1408
02:02:58,663 --> 02:02:58,983
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1409
02:02:59,023 --> 02:02:59,563
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1410
02:03:03,749 --> 02:03:07,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to say really quickly two quick things.

1411
02:03:07,031 --> 02:03:12,174
[SPEAKER_03]: I think my name was invoked earlier on to correct the record.

1412
02:03:13,014 --> 02:03:23,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I have been trying to make this meeting and the last meeting in person, but I've not been able to because of some academic and professional commitments.

1413
02:03:25,402 --> 02:03:28,143
[SPEAKER_03]: I was away for a weekend, but that didn't affect this work.

1414
02:03:31,225 --> 02:03:34,928
[SPEAKER_03]: I think in general, it seems like this discussion is getting a little out of hand.

1415
02:03:35,868 --> 02:03:43,513
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there are good questions being raised about how we can better communicate how the city council works in the first place.

1416
02:03:43,533 --> 02:03:51,299
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think I have to be very honest in saying that before I ran for office and when I was just the viewer of these meetings,

1417
02:03:52,159 --> 02:03:55,281
[SPEAKER_03]: that city council, how it worked, I also was confused by it.

1418
02:03:55,742 --> 02:04:05,749
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we need to just do better in general at communicating how we work, regardless of how subcommittees work, of how the general council works.

1419
02:04:06,149 --> 02:04:17,638
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think in the future, we need to create some short guide or some short document, some diagram showing people how these processes work.

1420
02:04:20,063 --> 02:04:22,623
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Leming, Councilor Callahan.

1421
02:04:23,104 --> 02:04:30,625
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd also just like to point out a few things about the process, since this is a resolution to discuss City Council subcommittee processes.

1422
02:04:30,665 --> 02:04:46,108
[SPEAKER_18]: So what we're doing in the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee is we have a continuing resolution, which is a resolution to innovate in the City Council's communication processes.

1423
02:04:46,168 --> 02:04:47,948
[SPEAKER_18]: And so that basically means that we come up with

1424
02:04:49,029 --> 02:04:51,510
[SPEAKER_18]: a number of ideas, one of which is the newsletter.

1425
02:04:51,530 --> 02:05:12,184
[SPEAKER_18]: And so in earlier committee meetings, we had motioned and agreed to, as a committee, come up with a schedule by which people draft the newsletter, and then every month have a different city councilor, not necessarily somebody on the committee, if they want to volunteer and have the time to put forward a draft of the newsletter, which would then be edited at a committee meeting.

1426
02:05:12,424 --> 02:05:17,588
[SPEAKER_18]: So if there are concerns, I mean, I think that the,

1427
02:05:18,608 --> 02:05:29,078
[SPEAKER_18]: Vagueness of resolutions or the specificity with which individual papers say that we're going to, you know, do X, Y or Z in committee is a continuing concern.

1428
02:05:29,118 --> 02:05:32,982
[SPEAKER_18]: Obviously, that's been a concern with this with this very agenda.

1429
02:05:33,562 --> 02:05:39,688
[SPEAKER_18]: But if it does make, I mean, we obviously can bring forth a another.

1430
02:05:40,669 --> 02:05:50,638
[SPEAKER_18]: resolution that more specifically states that we're going to put out a newsletter every month via committee for consideration at the regular meetings.

1431
02:05:50,738 --> 02:06:04,450
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just that with communications it is necessary to be timely and get something out there every month because events happen every month and we need to be consistent in our communications and

1432
02:06:05,191 --> 02:06:07,592
[SPEAKER_18]: we get criticized for being intransparent.

1433
02:06:08,412 --> 02:06:11,053
[SPEAKER_18]: And the newsletter is a way to address that.

1434
02:06:11,393 --> 02:06:13,454
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's important to be timely.

1435
02:06:13,474 --> 02:06:15,635
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you very much.

1436
02:06:16,215 --> 02:06:16,835
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's all I have.

1437
02:06:17,276 --> 02:06:18,016
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Callahan.

1438
02:06:18,595 --> 02:06:19,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

1439
02:06:19,896 --> 02:06:24,680
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to comment that what I described as the process is for ordinances.

1440
02:06:24,700 --> 02:06:26,682
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not necessarily for resolutions.

1441
02:06:26,742 --> 02:06:28,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Resolutions don't have to go through three readings.

1442
02:06:29,724 --> 02:06:33,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Different things that we pass through this body have different requirements.

1443
02:06:34,508 --> 02:06:38,471
[SPEAKER_05]: I certainly was not under the impression that the newsletter had a paper number.

1444
02:06:38,712 --> 02:06:42,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Each individual monthly newsletter has its own paper number, and therefore,

1445
02:06:43,095 --> 02:06:46,436
[SPEAKER_05]: must come out of committee and then be discussed in this body.

1446
02:06:46,697 --> 02:06:48,757
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy to do that if that is what we want to do.

1447
02:06:49,718 --> 02:06:59,542
[SPEAKER_05]: But I did think that that committee had the ability to pass a newsletter, since it's simply a thing that is happening.

1448
02:06:59,822 --> 02:07:01,123
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally appreciate it.

1449
02:07:01,143 --> 02:07:06,265
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very happy to change that understanding of mine and to have those sent to this body.

1450
02:07:06,365 --> 02:07:11,407
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not convinced that that would be a great idea, because I think editing, you know,

1451
02:07:12,364 --> 02:07:18,630
[SPEAKER_05]: hundred and fifty word newsletter in the city council meetings does not seem like a super great use of time.

1452
02:07:18,650 --> 02:07:23,334
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, to be honest, it's just like.

1453
02:07:24,346 --> 02:07:27,269
[SPEAKER_15]: We're spending a bunch of time talking about a couple of semantic issues.

1454
02:07:28,129 --> 02:07:29,210
[SPEAKER_15]: There was a resolution 24-015.

1455
02:07:29,230 --> 02:07:30,251
[SPEAKER_15]: Semantics for you.

1456
02:07:30,291 --> 02:07:33,254
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it's semantics in general.

1457
02:07:33,935 --> 02:07:42,903
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's 24-015 did not explicitly say that the committee could issue the newsletter itself and therefore the committee should have referred something back to the council.

1458
02:07:43,283 --> 02:07:49,605
[SPEAKER_15]: the council could absolutely vote to say this committee shall do X. We keep papers in committee all the time and meet on them multiple times.

1459
02:07:49,645 --> 02:07:52,126
[SPEAKER_15]: We just have done it three times in the past two weeks on the city budget.

1460
02:07:52,627 --> 02:07:53,307
[SPEAKER_15]: So you are correct.

1461
02:07:53,807 --> 02:07:58,649
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have sent out motions from that committee to the administration without them coming before this council.

1462
02:07:58,709 --> 02:08:01,590
[SPEAKER_15]: Additionally, we've approved committee reports coming from the committee.

1463
02:08:01,710 --> 02:08:03,611
[SPEAKER_15]: So arguably it was approved tonight.

1464
02:08:04,811 --> 02:08:06,192
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's a lot of ways that it happens.

1465
02:08:06,892 --> 02:08:08,953
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's why we're talking about

1466
02:08:09,773 --> 02:08:16,817
[SPEAKER_15]: Semantics, I think at this point it would probably be helpful if someone were to file a resolution that formally said the committee can do this.

1467
02:08:18,298 --> 02:08:22,500
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, it's a real good use of our time.

1468
02:08:24,581 --> 02:08:26,142
[SPEAKER_17]: That's just so wrong.

1469
02:08:26,582 --> 02:08:28,323
[SPEAKER_17]: It's semantics.

1470
02:08:28,423 --> 02:08:29,544
[SPEAKER_17]: In what way, Mr. President?

1471
02:08:30,222 --> 02:08:31,303
[SPEAKER_17]: in the way that I just described it.

1472
02:08:31,443 --> 02:08:40,128
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, it's pretty embarrassing, because for this council, I deserve the respect that when I bring something forward, that it's given back that same respect.

1473
02:08:40,669 --> 02:08:43,110
[SPEAKER_17]: And to call it that is out of line.

1474
02:08:43,671 --> 02:08:43,911
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

1475
02:08:45,132 --> 02:08:49,434
[SPEAKER_15]: I deserve also the respect that every other council has ever gotten when they sign a letter.

1476
02:08:49,494 --> 02:08:50,795
[SPEAKER_15]: You keep talking from the chair.

1477
02:08:51,135 --> 02:08:52,476
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, just, you know.

1478
02:08:54,398 --> 02:08:55,839
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further discussion on the matter?

1479
02:08:57,740 --> 02:08:59,641
[SPEAKER_31]: We should go to public participation or call to question.

1480
02:09:00,202 --> 02:09:04,466
[SPEAKER_15]: Great, is there a motion to call to question, or do we want to hear from the, do we want to go to public participation?

1481
02:09:04,486 --> 02:09:05,727
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further comments from councilors?

1482
02:09:07,289 --> 02:09:09,711
[SPEAKER_15]: Hearing no other motions, name and address for the record, please.

1483
02:09:11,323 --> 02:09:12,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1484
02:09:12,844 --> 02:09:15,086
[SPEAKER_11]: Gaston Fierro, 61 Stigney Road.

1485
02:09:15,946 --> 02:09:25,453
[SPEAKER_11]: So I thought that this discussion was about processes, same as 24-097, discuss processes dealing with possible homeroom petitions.

1486
02:09:26,874 --> 02:09:35,520
[SPEAKER_11]: I read the letter that got signed on April 16th, and that is directly related to subcommittee processes and homeroom petitions.

1487
02:09:35,980 --> 02:09:38,722
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just wanted to give my view on

1488
02:09:39,699 --> 02:09:40,680
[SPEAKER_11]: on the whole.

1489
02:09:40,780 --> 02:09:43,223
[SPEAKER_15]: How is it related to the subcommittee processes, if I may ask?

1490
02:09:43,603 --> 02:09:52,072
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we said on the meeting on March 12th that the discussion was to bring the transfer fee to subcommittee for discussion.

1491
02:09:52,772 --> 02:10:01,822
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I found this letter signed by the council president and vice president that got sent to the state legislature with

1492
02:10:03,183 --> 02:10:03,904
[SPEAKER_11]: a bunch of things.

1493
02:10:04,524 --> 02:10:14,132
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um, that's the part that I'm completely confused about, and I can put a little meaning to more detail, and maybe you can answer some of the questions that I have.

1494
02:10:14,152 --> 02:10:19,657
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it, um, uh, yeah, I think it would be relevant to the, uh, home rule petitions paper.

1495
02:10:20,157 --> 02:10:22,619
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, okay, if that is fine, but I'll Councilor.

1496
02:10:22,639 --> 02:10:23,440
[SPEAKER_15]: Will you prefer me to wait?

1497
02:10:23,460 --> 02:10:24,161
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm happy to wait.

1498
02:10:24,201 --> 02:10:25,422
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1499
02:10:25,702 --> 02:10:27,123
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, President Bears and Gaston.

1500
02:10:27,163 --> 02:10:28,304
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm sorry to interrupt you.

1501
02:10:28,384 --> 02:10:29,465
[SPEAKER_31]: I do think I was just gonna

1502
02:10:29,785 --> 02:10:31,947
[SPEAKER_31]: I think that's more relevant to a resolution that is coming up.

1503
02:10:32,328 --> 02:10:41,918
[SPEAKER_31]: I also have a clarification to offer that I think speaks directly to your question about the difference between what's talked about in the letter and the process of the home rule, but we can get to that under the next paper.

1504
02:10:41,938 --> 02:10:42,538
[SPEAKER_31]: So, sorry.

1505
02:10:42,678 --> 02:10:43,559
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, I'm happy to.

1506
02:10:43,599 --> 02:10:44,420
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you for indulging me.

1507
02:10:44,480 --> 02:10:45,541
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, I appreciate that.

1508
02:10:46,743 --> 02:10:48,064
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address for the record, please.

1509
02:10:48,084 --> 02:10:48,464
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening.

1510
02:10:49,926 --> 02:10:51,808
[SPEAKER_14]: Steve Sinella, 69 Whittier Road.

1511
02:10:53,194 --> 02:10:58,615
[SPEAKER_14]: So I've been getting a ton of calls and emails kind of based upon that letter.

1512
02:10:58,675 --> 02:11:01,856
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm kind of one of the person that reached out to George.

1513
02:11:01,936 --> 02:11:03,537
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure he got a ton of calls that night.

1514
02:11:05,237 --> 02:11:12,039
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a petition going kind of that's against the real estate transfer fee, the rent control and the first right of refusal.

1515
02:11:12,981 --> 02:11:14,983
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, it's ongoing.

1516
02:11:15,043 --> 02:11:17,566
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're still building a bunch of people to be able to sign that.

1517
02:11:17,606 --> 02:11:25,234
[SPEAKER_14]: But I was kind of holding this for subcommittee and got a lot of calls stating, you know, it looks like the city council's already signed off on this.

1518
02:11:25,795 --> 02:11:26,415
[SPEAKER_14]: No, we have not.

1519
02:11:26,676 --> 02:11:28,898
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, well, it's it was taken that way.

1520
02:11:29,298 --> 02:11:31,941
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of people called me and said, I feel like I've not heard.

1521
02:11:32,722 --> 02:11:33,523
[SPEAKER_14]: No one's listening.

1522
02:11:33,783 --> 02:11:34,543
[SPEAKER_14]: No one cares.

1523
02:11:35,224 --> 02:11:40,827
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, there's a lot of people in Medford and there's a lot of people you need to listen to and you're not listening at all.

1524
02:11:40,968 --> 02:11:49,433
[SPEAKER_14]: And by you, you guys putting that, you should have probably put it as layman and say that, you know, just Zach Beers is doing this and not the president and the vice president.

1525
02:11:50,214 --> 02:11:52,795
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I think that's a, you know, a big issue, right?

1526
02:11:53,196 --> 02:11:54,637
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'd like to drop off this petition.

1527
02:11:54,997 --> 02:11:57,078
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the first many, uh, it's about 300.

1528
02:11:57,399 --> 02:11:59,800
[SPEAKER_14]: And this was that night that you actually proposed this.

1529
02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:02,302
[SPEAKER_14]: We got about 300 people, uh, kind of to sign this.

1530
02:12:02,882 --> 02:12:04,664
[SPEAKER_14]: to be against what we're looking to do.

1531
02:12:05,304 --> 02:12:15,492
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you could just take that and forward it on and hopefully the subcommittee, and that you can clear up that you didn't put this out as the city of Medford.

1532
02:12:16,133 --> 02:12:16,653
[SPEAKER_14]: It's concerning.

1533
02:12:16,813 --> 02:12:18,815
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, you can deliver the petition to Larry.

1534
02:12:18,855 --> 02:12:19,856
[SPEAKER_15]: He will keep it on file.

1535
02:12:20,456 --> 02:12:22,217
[SPEAKER_15]: And what happened, there's two things here.

1536
02:12:22,257 --> 02:12:29,203
[SPEAKER_15]: So there was a letter written to the state house about a piece of legislation proposed by the governor, the Affordable Homes Act.

1537
02:12:29,966 --> 02:12:39,269
[SPEAKER_15]: and specifically a portion of that legislation, which would authorize cities and towns to discuss the implementation of a fee, a real estate transfer fee.

1538
02:12:40,549 --> 02:12:46,691
[SPEAKER_15]: As individual city councilors and as the council president and vice president, we signed on to the letter supporting that legislation.

1539
02:12:47,251 --> 02:12:53,693
[SPEAKER_15]: That is separate from the in-council proposal for a discussion of a home rule petition and subcommittee.

1540
02:12:53,733 --> 02:12:54,813
[SPEAKER_15]: So those are two different things.

1541
02:12:55,313 --> 02:13:02,916
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I know you're kind of stirring up a bee's nest, more or less, you know, there's a lot of folks that are, you know, starting to get angry about.

1542
02:13:02,997 --> 02:13:03,377
[SPEAKER_14]: I hear that.

1543
02:13:03,397 --> 02:13:08,539
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we should clarify that, that it wasn't the City of Medford, it was actually just two people putting it out there.

1544
02:13:08,559 --> 02:13:10,620
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, it was the Council President and Vice President.

1545
02:13:10,780 --> 02:13:11,520
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Callahan.

1546
02:13:12,281 --> 02:13:14,282
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope this can be clarifying for people.

1547
02:13:16,741 --> 02:13:25,427
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the idea is that we have a discussion as a community about what we would want, whether we want it, what it would look like in terms of a transfer fee.

1548
02:13:27,849 --> 02:13:35,294
[SPEAKER_05]: The letter that was signed is for the state to allow us to have that discussion, right?

1549
02:13:35,534 --> 02:13:39,657
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we can discuss it all we want, but we won't be able to- To give us the authority.

1550
02:13:39,677 --> 02:13:45,060
[SPEAKER_05]: To give us the authority, right, to have to, once we've had that discussion, to actually pass something.

1551
02:13:49,565 --> 02:13:53,727
[SPEAKER_05]: The idea of like, I think we all want to be able to have that discussion.

1552
02:13:54,007 --> 02:13:55,968
[SPEAKER_05]: We've literally not written a single word.

1553
02:13:56,688 --> 02:13:58,189
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to have the discussion.

1554
02:13:59,209 --> 02:14:04,531
[SPEAKER_05]: And that letter doesn't do anything but try to enable us to be able to have the discussion as a community.

1555
02:14:06,052 --> 02:14:06,512
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1556
02:14:07,442 --> 02:14:07,722
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1557
02:14:07,782 --> 02:14:09,003
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think it was taken that way.

1558
02:14:09,123 --> 02:14:10,144
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of information.

1559
02:14:10,224 --> 02:14:10,724
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to go.

1560
02:14:10,984 --> 02:14:11,244
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1561
02:14:11,304 --> 02:14:12,125
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1562
02:14:12,485 --> 02:14:15,087
[SPEAKER_17]: We can have that discussion whether it's a letter or not.

1563
02:14:15,127 --> 02:14:16,367
[SPEAKER_17]: Please, please explain.

1564
02:14:17,788 --> 02:14:20,650
[SPEAKER_17]: That's sending a wrong message.

1565
02:14:20,710 --> 02:14:24,032
[SPEAKER_17]: We can have a discussion without sending anything to the state.

1566
02:14:24,432 --> 02:14:25,012
[SPEAKER_17]: That's not true.

1567
02:14:25,232 --> 02:14:25,532
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1568
02:14:27,438 --> 02:14:30,381
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, yes, and that's what we're doing in the committee.

1569
02:14:32,203 --> 02:14:37,588
[SPEAKER_15]: I also, as a councillor, signed a letter about something I think the state should let all cities and towns do.

1570
02:14:37,928 --> 02:14:42,112
[SPEAKER_15]: This is why people were allowed because you used your titles.

1571
02:14:42,172 --> 02:14:42,493
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all.

1572
02:14:42,873 --> 02:14:43,133
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1573
02:14:45,215 --> 02:14:46,777
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further discussion by members of the council?

1574
02:14:46,837 --> 02:14:49,039
[SPEAKER_15]: Seeing none, I'm going to go to Maureen D. on Zoom.

1575
02:14:49,079 --> 02:14:50,621
[SPEAKER_15]: Maureen, name and address for the record, please.

1576
02:15:01,658 --> 02:15:03,299
[SPEAKER_15]: Maureen, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

1577
02:15:05,560 --> 02:15:06,341
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, that's better.

1578
02:15:07,921 --> 02:15:13,244
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Maureen Donovan, and I live at 55 Elkworth Street in Medford.

1579
02:15:13,324 --> 02:15:15,365
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been a resident for 34 years.

1580
02:15:16,246 --> 02:15:24,090
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have a copy of the letter right here in front of me, and I read it about a half dozen times and made notations with it.

1581
02:15:24,450 --> 02:15:27,772
[SPEAKER_09]: And I agree with somewhat

1582
02:15:30,529 --> 02:15:52,391
[SPEAKER_09]: everyone's comments, but I take umbrage, to use the vice president's word, to the fact that it didn't follow a subcommittee process, that there was a lack of transparency, that the two members that signed it blindsided

1583
02:15:55,138 --> 02:16:00,947
[SPEAKER_09]: more than 50% of their council members, by putting this forward, that it

1584
02:16:03,012 --> 02:16:13,699
[SPEAKER_09]: misrepresented the council in general, but even more grievous, it misrepresented the residents of the city of Medford.

1585
02:16:14,400 --> 02:16:17,421
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will read to you right here.

1586
02:16:18,202 --> 02:16:31,631
[SPEAKER_09]: We write to you as municipal officers and staff who work each and every day to provide livable and affordable housing for our residents to express our enthusiastic support.

1587
02:16:34,340 --> 02:16:44,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but the residents of Medford elected this city council.

1588
02:16:45,507 --> 02:16:58,535
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that your mission is to work with the vast majority or popular vote of the city, of the residents in the city of Medford

1589
02:16:59,557 --> 02:17:02,539
[SPEAKER_09]: and you didn't represent all of us.

1590
02:17:03,559 --> 02:17:09,603
[SPEAKER_09]: You represented two of yourselves on the city council.

1591
02:17:10,383 --> 02:17:22,931
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd like to know how many of the residents of the city of Medford did you represent when you sent this letter to the state house and signed it?

1592
02:17:25,530 --> 02:17:31,012
[SPEAKER_15]: And we were representing, as you noted, municipal officers and Councilor Collins and I are two municipal officers.

1593
02:17:32,112 --> 02:17:45,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, but the rhetoric or the language in the letter insinuated that you were representing the whole body and the residents of Medford.

1594
02:17:46,096 --> 02:17:46,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you correct me?

1595
02:17:47,036 --> 02:17:49,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I have it in black and white in front of me.

1596
02:17:49,804 --> 02:18:02,931
[SPEAKER_15]: you look at the signatures on the letter, there's a section for people who are signing on behalf of the body and officers who are signing as individuals, and Vice President Collins and I were signed under the section representing individuals.

1597
02:18:04,229 --> 02:18:24,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I respect your individual opinions on this matter, but what I find disrespectful is your lack of transparency and lack of communication with the vast majority of taxpayers in the city of Medford.

1598
02:18:25,253 --> 02:18:29,074
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's what you really need to look at.

1599
02:18:30,455 --> 02:18:36,618
[SPEAKER_09]: There are major issues within our community that get ignored day after day after day.

1600
02:18:37,258 --> 02:18:46,382
[SPEAKER_09]: The school department, the infrastructure of the streets and sidewalks, just to name a few.

1601
02:18:48,083 --> 02:18:53,746
[SPEAKER_09]: So could someone like to respond to me about that respectfully?

1602
02:18:54,758 --> 02:19:10,312
[SPEAKER_15]: The issues we are certainly working on all of those issues we've had, you know, dozens of meetings in the past few months, touching on every subject that you said, but again, you know, we were actually literally as elected officials signing a public letter so that the public would know.

1603
02:19:10,872 --> 02:19:14,634
[SPEAKER_15]: our position on the local option transfer fee and the Affordable Homes Act.

1604
02:19:14,754 --> 02:19:20,438
[SPEAKER_15]: So as individual Councilors, we were sending a letter to inform the public about our opinion on an issue.

1605
02:19:21,498 --> 02:19:27,962
[SPEAKER_15]: The individual Councilors signing on to public statements does not have to go through any sort of council process.

1606
02:19:28,902 --> 02:19:29,963
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's how that works.

1607
02:19:31,544 --> 02:19:33,345
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Collins, Councilor Lazzaro.

1608
02:19:34,906 --> 02:19:35,206
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1609
02:19:35,246 --> 02:19:35,766
[SPEAKER_31]: I apologize.

1610
02:19:35,806 --> 02:19:38,768
[SPEAKER_31]: I made a motion to call the question, but I just want to interject with one more thing.

1611
02:19:40,046 --> 02:19:47,948
[SPEAKER_31]: Like I mentioned, I exercise my right and privilege to add my name to sign on letters at my discretion.

1612
02:19:48,728 --> 02:19:54,449
[SPEAKER_31]: Another topic that we talked about earlier in the agenda, the payment in lieu of tax legislation that's being considered by the State House.

1613
02:19:56,050 --> 02:20:04,612
[SPEAKER_31]: Last week, I also added my name to a list of signatories separate from the paper that we discussed and dispensed with tonight, I also signed that letter.

1614
02:20:06,181 --> 02:20:11,103
[SPEAKER_31]: acting as myself as an individual, signing on as Kit Collins, Vice President of the Medford City Council.

1615
02:20:11,143 --> 02:20:18,526
[SPEAKER_31]: And like all the other times that I've done that, the letter was not phrased in such a way as to purport that I was speaking for this council, because I wasn't.

1616
02:20:19,466 --> 02:20:22,648
[SPEAKER_31]: I made no assertion of speaking for this council, because I wasn't.

1617
02:20:23,188 --> 02:20:24,729
[SPEAKER_31]: I was endorsing it as an individual.

1618
02:20:25,229 --> 02:20:31,091
[SPEAKER_31]: Tonight, when we passed that resolution, we chose, through our votes, to endorse it as a council.

1619
02:20:36,610 --> 02:20:47,493
[SPEAKER_31]: And I don't disparage anybody for feeling angry or disappointed in me for choosing to advocate for issues that you would rather I not.

1620
02:20:47,813 --> 02:20:48,454
[SPEAKER_31]: That is your right.

1621
02:20:49,654 --> 02:20:54,175
[SPEAKER_31]: I know that there are many people in the community who disagree with me on that issue and many others, and many who do.

1622
02:20:55,016 --> 02:21:02,658
[SPEAKER_31]: And that is your right, and it is absolutely your right and your privilege to say so in these public meetings, however you want to.

1623
02:21:03,171 --> 02:21:16,854
[SPEAKER_31]: However, I really do think that we need to correct the record and draw a distinction between an individual official endorsing a policy using their own individual name and saying that this is in some way a breach of our process.

1624
02:21:16,994 --> 02:21:18,114
[SPEAKER_31]: They are two separate things.

1625
02:21:18,714 --> 02:21:27,536
[SPEAKER_31]: You are well within your rights to say, I disagree with you and I wish you wouldn't advocate for that, but that's not the same thing as us breaking a regulation.

1626
02:21:27,856 --> 02:21:30,456
[SPEAKER_31]: And I really will stop speaking on the topic now.

1627
02:21:30,697 --> 02:21:30,977
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1628
02:21:31,197 --> 02:21:31,617
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1629
02:21:31,677 --> 02:21:32,837
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to second the motion.

1630
02:21:34,514 --> 02:21:36,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lazzaro.

1631
02:21:36,495 --> 02:21:38,517
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't, I don't know what this letter is.

1632
02:21:38,657 --> 02:21:39,757
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not on the agenda.

1633
02:21:39,857 --> 02:21:41,779
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't read it and I can't find it online.

1634
02:21:41,919 --> 02:21:43,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we not talk about the letter anymore?

1635
02:21:43,480 --> 02:21:46,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I literally, I don't even know what the letter is.

1636
02:21:47,262 --> 02:21:49,624
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not on the agenda and it's not included in the packet.

1637
02:21:49,684 --> 02:21:51,505
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't feel equipped to discuss it.

1638
02:21:52,505 --> 02:21:54,867
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not something that we were supposed to talk about tonight.

1639
02:21:55,247 --> 02:21:59,430
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Vice President Collins to call the question seconded by Councilor Lemme.

1640
02:22:00,493 --> 02:22:04,654
[SPEAKER_09]: shouldn't all of the city council members be aware of this letter?

1641
02:22:06,535 --> 02:22:07,375
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a public letter.

1642
02:22:13,357 --> 02:22:15,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, then why don't the city council members?

1643
02:22:16,458 --> 02:22:18,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Why aren't they aware of it if it's public?

1644
02:22:18,859 --> 02:22:19,159
[SPEAKER_15]: Green?

1645
02:22:19,619 --> 02:22:20,420
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't I don't know.

1646
02:22:20,480 --> 02:22:20,760
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't.

1647
02:22:21,640 --> 02:22:22,901
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know what news people read.

1648
02:22:22,941 --> 02:22:24,021
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know what letters people read.

1649
02:22:26,843 --> 02:22:27,683
[SPEAKER_15]: I do not control that.

1650
02:22:28,124 --> 02:22:32,365
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Council Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Leming, to call the question.

1651
02:22:35,827 --> 02:22:37,308
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1652
02:22:38,008 --> 02:22:38,928
[SPEAKER_21]: To call the question, yes.

1653
02:22:38,968 --> 02:22:40,869
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. President, can I speak on that first?

1654
02:22:41,349 --> 02:22:41,530
[SPEAKER_28]: No.

1655
02:22:42,390 --> 02:22:43,350
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Collins?

1656
02:22:43,851 --> 02:22:44,011
Yes.

1657
02:22:44,931 --> 02:22:45,691
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Lazzaro?

1658
02:22:45,731 --> 02:22:46,032
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1659
02:22:46,872 --> 02:22:47,452
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Leming?

1660
02:22:47,592 --> 02:22:47,852
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1661
02:22:48,373 --> 02:22:49,153
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1662
02:22:52,194 --> 02:22:53,615
[SPEAKER_17]: No, we have people that want to speak.

1663
02:22:53,979 --> 02:22:55,380
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a motion to call the question.

1664
02:22:55,400 --> 02:22:56,641
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a motion to call the previous question.

1665
02:22:56,661 --> 02:22:58,742
[SPEAKER_15]: It's undebatable.

1666
02:22:58,782 --> 02:23:00,203
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a motion to call the previous question.

1667
02:23:00,223 --> 02:23:02,164
[SPEAKER_15]: It's undebatable.

1668
02:23:02,244 --> 02:23:03,605
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a police order.

1669
02:23:05,106 --> 02:23:06,987
[SPEAKER_28]: Did you withdraw it?

1670
02:23:07,027 --> 02:23:07,467
[SPEAKER_18]: I said no.

1671
02:23:08,348 --> 02:23:08,988
[SPEAKER_18]: There's another item.

1672
02:23:09,008 --> 02:23:09,128
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1673
02:23:12,264 --> 02:23:13,125
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, 60 for everyone.

1674
02:23:13,145 --> 02:23:22,557
[SPEAKER_15]: The negative motion passes on the rule for the previous question that's initiates a 15 minute period where Councilors may further debate the calling of the question.

1675
02:23:23,197 --> 02:23:25,781
[SPEAKER_15]: Each Councilor can speak for up to, I believe, two minutes.

1676
02:23:27,646 --> 02:23:29,387
[SPEAKER_15]: Other councillors would like to speak further on the matter?

1677
02:23:29,527 --> 02:23:31,049
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Leming.

1678
02:23:31,069 --> 02:23:38,894
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd just like to point out that I second the motion because we still have to get to 24097, which actually discusses the home rule petitions.

1679
02:23:39,114 --> 02:23:44,839
[SPEAKER_18]: We were still on the subcommittee processes and we hadn't been really discussing that, so that's all I have to say.

1680
02:23:46,680 --> 02:23:47,040
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1681
02:23:47,080 --> 02:23:49,002
[SPEAKER_15]: Do councillors have any further on this paper?

1682
02:23:51,992 --> 02:23:57,955
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion is the motion by Councilor Scarpelli to discuss the City Council subcommittee processes.

1683
02:23:58,015 --> 02:24:00,497
[SPEAKER_15]: And also, there were two amendments to the motion.

1684
02:24:01,717 --> 02:24:03,718
[SPEAKER_15]: Could you read back the amendments to the motion, Mr. Clerk?

1685
02:24:05,159 --> 02:24:11,002
[SPEAKER_21]: To get a legal opinion on whether City Council wants to use the title.

1686
02:24:12,303 --> 02:24:19,406
[SPEAKER_21]: What's the legal representation on whether using the title as a City Councilor in a campaign?

1687
02:24:21,744 --> 02:24:31,727
[SPEAKER_21]: So the first one is that... And there's also use of titles by city officials that give the impression that something is offered as an official act of counsel.

1688
02:24:32,528 --> 02:24:37,089
[SPEAKER_21]: And then there's one about... It was one related to newsletters and whether they were campaigning.

1689
02:24:37,549 --> 02:24:42,971
[SPEAKER_17]: Right, the question is for the legal department to ask if a newsletter that's being put forth could be construed as campaigning.

1690
02:24:45,049 --> 02:24:58,934
[SPEAKER_17]: But the question the first question is legal opinion using City Council titles and correspondence to the state or other entities that give the impression that the information is offered as an official act of the City Council.

1691
02:25:00,375 --> 02:25:03,176
[SPEAKER_15]: Can we further amend that to give the impression to a reasonable person?

1692
02:25:09,502 --> 02:25:10,282
[SPEAKER_17]: the legal standard.

1693
02:25:10,723 --> 02:25:20,929
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, if I can, I did forward the edification for Council Leming on the 23rd of that evening at 8.23.

1694
02:25:23,294 --> 02:25:29,737
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't have your number readily available, Councilor Leming, so I know that Councilor Villes wasn't in-house that evening.

1695
02:25:29,757 --> 02:25:30,757
[SPEAKER_15]: I was not at that point, no.

1696
02:25:30,817 --> 02:25:36,819
[SPEAKER_17]: So I thought I was on the assumption you were, so, because I was also sick, so.

1697
02:25:37,119 --> 02:25:37,940
[SPEAKER_15]: My apologies for that.

1698
02:25:37,980 --> 02:25:47,524
[SPEAKER_17]: No, what I said was, on that text was, hey, Zach, I'm out if you could just, so you could just move the questions quicker, because I have to leave.

1699
02:25:48,144 --> 02:25:49,904
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's when I asked about,

1700
02:25:51,526 --> 02:25:54,132
[SPEAKER_17]: seeing if we can have any meetings outside of Wednesdays.

1701
02:25:54,713 --> 02:25:55,375
[SPEAKER_17]: So, thank you.

1702
02:25:56,377 --> 02:25:56,837
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1703
02:25:57,017 --> 02:26:03,841
[SPEAKER_15]: So the rule 23 on the previous question, members must gain the floor part of making such a motion, which Vice President Collins did.

1704
02:26:03,881 --> 02:26:05,041
[SPEAKER_15]: A motion must receive a second.

1705
02:26:05,081 --> 02:26:07,303
[SPEAKER_15]: It received one by Councilor Leming.

1706
02:26:07,723 --> 02:26:11,965
[SPEAKER_15]: All further amendment or debate of the main question shall be suspended until the previous question is decided.

1707
02:26:12,545 --> 02:26:19,449
[SPEAKER_15]: On the previous question, non-exceeding 15 minutes shall be allowed for debate, which shall be confined to giving reasons why the main question should not be put to an immediate vote.

1708
02:26:19,889 --> 02:26:22,250
[SPEAKER_15]: And no member shall speak for more than two minutes after such debate.

1709
02:26:22,310 --> 02:26:25,932
[SPEAKER_15]: A majority vote shall be sufficient to end debate on the main question and require an immediate vote.

1710
02:26:27,076 --> 02:26:31,162
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there any further debate on why the previous question should not be put on paper 24-094?

1711
02:26:31,222 --> 02:26:32,023
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Callahan.

1712
02:26:50,089 --> 02:26:53,570
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not debate on the merits of the main question.

1713
02:26:53,590 --> 02:26:56,911
[SPEAKER_15]: It's debates on why we should continue debate.

1714
02:26:57,891 --> 02:26:58,231
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1715
02:26:58,351 --> 02:27:00,332
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further discussion on why we should continue debate?

1716
02:27:03,272 --> 02:27:09,154
[SPEAKER_15]: Seeing none, on the motion on the main question on the paper proposed by Councilor Scarpelli as amended by Councilor Scarpelli.

1717
02:27:10,574 --> 02:27:11,775
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1718
02:27:15,216 --> 02:27:16,416
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a second on the main paper?

1719
02:27:18,359 --> 02:27:19,779
[SPEAKER_15]: Seconded by Vice President Collins.

1720
02:27:19,819 --> 02:27:20,760
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1721
02:27:23,480 --> 02:27:24,221
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Callahan?

1722
02:27:24,381 --> 02:27:24,541
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

1723
02:27:25,861 --> 02:27:26,641
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Collins?

1724
02:27:26,981 --> 02:27:27,161
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1725
02:27:28,902 --> 02:27:29,742
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Lazzaro?

1726
02:27:30,002 --> 02:27:30,182
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1727
02:27:31,322 --> 02:27:31,942
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Lemingke?

1728
02:27:32,263 --> 02:27:32,483
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1729
02:27:33,523 --> 02:27:34,263
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1730
02:27:35,063 --> 02:27:35,323
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1731
02:27:36,364 --> 02:27:36,964
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Tseng?

1732
02:27:37,444 --> 02:27:37,624
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1733
02:27:40,865 --> 02:27:41,926
[SPEAKER_21]: President Ferris.

1734
02:27:41,946 --> 02:27:44,427
[SPEAKER_15]: No, three in the affirmative, four in the negative, the motion fails.

1735
02:27:44,447 --> 02:27:51,410
[SPEAKER_15]: 24-096, resolution offered by Councilor Scarpelli, resolution that the City Council finalize dates for a walking tour of all firehouses in the city.

1736
02:27:51,450 --> 02:27:55,492
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved that the City Council finalize dates for a walking tour to all firehouses in the city.

1737
02:27:55,732 --> 02:27:56,272
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. Chairman.

1738
02:27:57,473 --> 02:27:59,534
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe we have reached.

1739
02:28:00,034 --> 02:28:00,654
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Chairman.

1740
02:28:01,075 --> 02:28:01,955
[SPEAKER_15]: Excuse me, thank you.

1741
02:28:02,395 --> 02:28:05,157
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Pente, you could speak at public participation, that's all.

1742
02:28:05,857 --> 02:28:06,717
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanted to speak on that.

1743
02:28:08,118 --> 02:28:09,639
[SPEAKER_15]: The home rule petition is the next paper.

1744
02:28:14,249 --> 02:28:15,550
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe we have a date for this.

1745
02:28:15,770 --> 02:28:15,550
1030?

1746
02:28:15,790 --> 02:28:16,010
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1747
02:28:16,090 --> 02:28:17,371
[SPEAKER_20]: Any further discussion?

1748
02:28:17,411 --> 02:28:17,572
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1749
02:28:43,416 --> 02:28:48,698
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody tried, I believe at least four of us will be able to attend the 18th at 1030.

1750
02:28:50,179 --> 02:28:50,919
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further discussion?

1751
02:28:50,939 --> 02:28:52,280
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you want to vote on it or do you want to withdraw it?

1752
02:28:56,441 --> 02:28:56,581
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.

1753
02:28:57,282 --> 02:29:02,264
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion, on the withdrawal, the motion is withdrawn, 24-096.

1754
02:29:02,284 --> 02:29:07,606
[SPEAKER_15]: 24-097, be it resolved, the City Council discuss processes dealing with possible home rule petitions.

1755
02:29:09,067 --> 02:29:09,807
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1756
02:29:18,755 --> 02:29:31,503
[SPEAKER_17]: where our leadership moving forward, where the mayor stands on this and getting her more involved as we discuss the processes.

1757
02:29:31,583 --> 02:29:39,708
[SPEAKER_17]: So the process for a home rule petition is this council would discuss it, any issue, then it would be voted.

1758
02:29:39,748 --> 02:29:46,352
[SPEAKER_17]: If it's voted through, it would then go to the mayor's office and the mayor would then have the option to veto it or move it through.

1759
02:29:46,872 --> 02:29:48,313
[SPEAKER_17]: And then it would go to the state house, correct?

1760
02:29:48,772 --> 02:29:55,461
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe, actually, that if the mayor chooses not to submit it, that the council cannot overrule her.

1761
02:29:56,002 --> 02:29:56,743
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, is that true?

1762
02:29:56,763 --> 02:29:57,424
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe so, yes.

1763
02:29:57,504 --> 02:30:00,267
[SPEAKER_17]: Because the other question was that if it came back to the council,

1764
02:30:01,127 --> 02:30:05,169
[SPEAKER_17]: we could do vote on overruling her decision.

1765
02:30:05,329 --> 02:30:12,373
[SPEAKER_15]: So we sent 6-1 last year, the home rule petitions on the budget and the charter ballot questions.

1766
02:30:12,913 --> 02:30:14,113
[SPEAKER_15]: Those were sent to her 6-1.

1767
02:30:14,173 --> 02:30:17,255
[SPEAKER_15]: She did not return them and she did not submit them.

1768
02:30:17,315 --> 02:30:23,018
[SPEAKER_15]: There is no legal requirement under state law, according to the meetings we had with council about that for her to return it to us.

1769
02:30:23,438 --> 02:30:25,079
[SPEAKER_15]: And we cannot override her decision.

1770
02:30:25,419 --> 02:30:28,521
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is the process just sort of to be to be informed.

1771
02:30:28,541 --> 02:30:30,783
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe I'll explain a little bit better.

1772
02:30:30,863 --> 02:30:35,627
[SPEAKER_17]: So as this process goes on, we start talking about different home petitions.

1773
02:30:36,227 --> 02:30:44,653
[SPEAKER_17]: The question also falls in not just in the council, but what the process is with the mayor's office and then with the state delegates and then moving forward.

1774
02:30:44,693 --> 02:30:45,534
[SPEAKER_17]: So I appreciate that.

1775
02:30:45,994 --> 02:30:46,695
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, thank you.

1776
02:30:46,915 --> 02:30:49,297
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think, yeah, just to go into it just a little more.

1777
02:30:49,884 --> 02:31:02,567
[SPEAKER_15]: Any Councilor could put a resolution on the agenda to request that this council as a collective body submit a home rule petition to the legislature requesting that the city have the authority to do something that it currently does not have the authority to do.

1778
02:31:03,247 --> 02:31:08,848
[SPEAKER_15]: For example, we've submitted a home rule petition to ask Tufts to do the institutional master plan.

1779
02:31:10,369 --> 02:31:10,829
[SPEAKER_15]: A charter

1780
02:31:11,890 --> 02:31:13,971
[SPEAKER_15]: change would be a home rule petition.

1781
02:31:14,051 --> 02:31:16,072
[SPEAKER_15]: The transfer fee was a home rule petition.

1782
02:31:16,472 --> 02:31:25,716
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's this body acting collectively to request that state allowed the body to take an action, authorized the city to take action.

1783
02:31:26,276 --> 02:31:31,519
[SPEAKER_15]: Many home rule petitions have been granted, and there are many special acts that apply to the city of Medford.

1784
02:31:32,199 --> 02:31:36,421
[SPEAKER_15]: But as Councilor Scarpelli noted, a councillor would propose that it would be on a regular meeting agenda.

1785
02:31:37,256 --> 02:31:41,900
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, that could be referred to a committee as the charter ballot questions were last year.

1786
02:31:41,920 --> 02:31:47,764
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, those were then, uh, discussed in committee, referred back to the regular council.

1787
02:31:48,264 --> 02:31:51,587
[SPEAKER_15]: The council voted to send them by a 6 to 1 vote.

1788
02:31:52,147 --> 02:31:56,951
[SPEAKER_15]: The mayor decided not to send them to the statehouse, and therefore they died at that point.

1789
02:31:57,731 --> 02:32:00,073
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, if the mayor had sent them to the statehouse,

1790
02:32:00,673 --> 02:32:02,774
[SPEAKER_15]: then the state house would consider the petitions.

1791
02:32:02,834 --> 02:32:09,255
[SPEAKER_15]: Technically, they would be entered in by our representatives and senator into the general court as a piece of legislation.

1792
02:32:09,836 --> 02:32:26,540
[SPEAKER_15]: Then that piece of legislation would have to pass through the state house and the state senate and be signed by the governor, at which point the law, there would be a law of the state of Massachusetts, and that law would say that the city of Medford is authorized to do X. So that is the process.

1793
02:32:28,504 --> 02:32:31,746
[SPEAKER_15]: Any discussion by members of the council on the process for a home rule petition?

1794
02:32:34,649 --> 02:32:36,710
[SPEAKER_15]: Seeing none, discussion by members of the public.

1795
02:32:37,130 --> 02:32:38,231
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address for the record, please.

1796
02:32:38,611 --> 02:32:41,514
[SPEAKER_28]: Robert Pinto, Zero Summit Road in Medford, Mass.

1797
02:32:42,154 --> 02:32:53,983
[SPEAKER_28]: Regarding the public letter that was written on April 16th regarding House Bill, I believe it's 3128, the Affordable Home Act.

1798
02:32:54,103 --> 02:32:55,163
[SPEAKER_28]: In that particular bill,

1799
02:32:56,141 --> 02:33:01,909
[SPEAKER_28]: There were transfers fees also that could be beneficial to a community that were discussed.

1800
02:33:02,470 --> 02:33:11,343
[SPEAKER_28]: And there was seven inclusions as it related what you could and could not do, which also had an opt-in and an opt-out proviso in that bill.

1801
02:33:12,364 --> 02:33:23,392
[SPEAKER_28]: But I'd like to, to you, Mr. Chairman, I want to get to your letter of April 28, where you sent out a notice saying, correcting the record on Medved's plans to address the housing crisis.

1802
02:33:24,072 --> 02:33:26,434
[SPEAKER_28]: And two particular paragraphs were sort of like, watch me.

1803
02:33:27,054 --> 02:33:28,815
[SPEAKER_28]: The first, the first one states the following.

1804
02:33:29,736 --> 02:33:47,055
[SPEAKER_28]: The City Council and the City Planning staff are working on zoning rebuild reforms to allow more housing to be built, reduce permitting and regulatory burdens for private property owners, encouraging major economic development, and require construction of more

1805
02:33:47,916 --> 02:33:49,837
[SPEAKER_28]: subsidize affordable housing units.

1806
02:33:50,358 --> 02:33:56,761
[SPEAKER_28]: We are also working on policies to benefit good landlords like the Good Landlord Tax Credit.

1807
02:33:57,422 --> 02:34:02,525
[SPEAKER_28]: And the second paragraph reads, the final piece of that comprehensive approach

1808
02:34:03,405 --> 02:34:20,392
[SPEAKER_28]: is anti-disbursement policies targeted at the large corporations who are buying properties, jacking up rents, and earning a huge profit by knocking out long-time residents and making unnaturally affordable units too expensive for the average person.

1809
02:34:22,242 --> 02:34:31,150
[SPEAKER_28]: I understand what you wrote, but I don't understand who these large corporations that are coming in here into the city of Medford and they're dispersing people.

1810
02:34:31,870 --> 02:34:40,758
[SPEAKER_28]: I see houses that are bought by individuals who had an opportunity to buy a single family or two family house as an individual, but not as a corporation.

1811
02:34:41,379 --> 02:34:48,325
[SPEAKER_28]: And you sent this out apparently because you wanted to allegedly, you know, correct something that was sent out.

1812
02:34:49,502 --> 02:35:01,275
[SPEAKER_28]: But if I were to see this as I did see it, I'm confused right now because I don't know of any major large corporations that have come in to the city of Medford and bought single or two family homes.

1813
02:35:02,369 --> 02:35:06,311
[SPEAKER_28]: either tore them down, rebuilt them, and sold them for large profit.

1814
02:35:06,431 --> 02:35:07,992
[SPEAKER_28]: I know individual people have done it.

1815
02:35:08,653 --> 02:35:14,676
[SPEAKER_28]: But when you say large corporations, it makes it look like this city is now being overrun by large corporations.

1816
02:35:15,516 --> 02:35:19,859
[SPEAKER_28]: And if you're going to address that through your zoning and your community development,

1817
02:35:22,278 --> 02:35:23,799
[SPEAKER_28]: The wording is very important.

1818
02:35:24,600 --> 02:35:31,824
[SPEAKER_28]: And this type of wording makes it look like corporate America has just taken over the city of Medford, making it unaffordable for people to live here.

1819
02:35:32,525 --> 02:35:33,525
[SPEAKER_28]: And that's not fair.

1820
02:35:33,966 --> 02:35:45,113
[SPEAKER_28]: You also have the opportunity of a business person or a business lady who may be able to come in here, can afford to buy a single or two or a three family house, do it over, and if they can make a profit, so be it.

1821
02:35:45,773 --> 02:35:50,637
[SPEAKER_28]: If the city really wants to get into affordable housing and low and moderate income housing,

1822
02:35:51,457 --> 02:35:55,238
[SPEAKER_28]: They've had the last eight years to talk about this and do something.

1823
02:35:55,978 --> 02:36:00,039
[SPEAKER_28]: And if they're not going to do it, then maybe it should be on the burden of the city council.

1824
02:36:00,359 --> 02:36:08,381
[SPEAKER_28]: And maybe you just you guys and girls, you just voted tonight on a CPA to give more money out, maybe to a place in the Brooks Estates.

1825
02:36:08,881 --> 02:36:09,801
[SPEAKER_28]: But put that aside.

1826
02:36:10,241 --> 02:36:19,223
[SPEAKER_28]: If you're really concerned and really serious about affordable housing, you should start putting all your pennies together on all your nickels and all your dimes and all your resources where the money can come in.

1827
02:36:20,063 --> 02:36:21,324
[SPEAKER_28]: and really have a second look.

1828
02:36:22,125 --> 02:36:35,354
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, when the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I think it's could be almost 12-13 years ago, came out with the CPA tax, we were supposed to, like other cities and towns, get a percentage of what the profit was on the state's annual profit.

1829
02:36:35,754 --> 02:36:36,815
[SPEAKER_28]: We haven't gotten anything.

1830
02:36:37,515 --> 02:36:47,240
[SPEAKER_28]: So you're really putting the burden right back on the Medford taxpayer, or the Medford city government to go forward and look for that type of development, look for that type of money.

1831
02:36:47,800 --> 02:36:49,001
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, here's your chance.

1832
02:36:49,361 --> 02:36:58,445
[SPEAKER_28]: Before you get into the, you know, Worcester just got through passing, I don't know if you folks realize it, they just got through passing on April 29th, March 9th of this year.

1833
02:37:00,166 --> 02:37:03,828
[SPEAKER_28]: The registry as it relates to single and two family and three family homes.

1834
02:37:04,790 --> 02:37:07,651
[SPEAKER_28]: They had that, they voted on that in September of 2022.

1835
02:37:08,311 --> 02:37:12,632
[SPEAKER_28]: And it took them two years before they implemented it.

1836
02:37:12,952 --> 02:37:21,734
[SPEAKER_28]: They are now meeting in their next main meeting to make revisions to it because of the pushback, because there's a lot of stringent material into that registry.

1837
02:37:22,274 --> 02:37:27,636
[SPEAKER_28]: But the best part about the whole thing, as the city manager said, he's willing to make changes and tone it down.

1838
02:37:28,396 --> 02:37:35,637
[SPEAKER_28]: Can you imagine having, if you don't go and register, you're gonna get a $300 fine, and every single day you don't register, it's a $300 fine?

1839
02:37:35,837 --> 02:37:38,598
[SPEAKER_28]: That's kind of excessive, really excessive.

1840
02:37:38,898 --> 02:37:40,878
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, you don't wanna go to these extremes.

1841
02:37:41,218 --> 02:37:55,361
[SPEAKER_28]: And what you do wanna, if you really believe in what you're talking about, you wanna have a full-blown discussions with the pros and the cons, and how this thing can or cannot work, and how does it fit into the city of Medford's lifestyle.

1842
02:37:56,181 --> 02:38:07,728
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. Chairman, with all due respect, I do not see large corporations coming into our city in Medford, street after street, buying and taking over real estate, turning it over and making a huge profit.

1843
02:38:08,329 --> 02:38:13,772
[SPEAKER_28]: If a single person, be it yourself or any member of the council, has the ability to do it, good luck to you.

1844
02:38:14,093 --> 02:38:15,353
[SPEAKER_28]: That's what America is all about.

1845
02:38:16,074 --> 02:38:24,960
[SPEAKER_28]: If you're trying to reduce the rents, you're trying to reduce the cost of living, trying to reduce everything else, then speak to your state legislature, speak to your federal authorities.

1846
02:38:25,720 --> 02:38:29,303
[SPEAKER_28]: They're the ones that should be looking out for you, just as well as your local authorities.

1847
02:38:29,623 --> 02:38:30,424
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. Penta.

1848
02:38:30,524 --> 02:38:31,004
[SPEAKER_28]: You're welcome.

1849
02:38:32,225 --> 02:38:35,468
[SPEAKER_15]: We go to Sharon on zoom name and address record, please.

1850
02:38:42,914 --> 02:38:45,055
[SPEAKER_15]: Sharon DSL on zoom name and address.

1851
02:38:45,196 --> 02:38:46,016
[SPEAKER_20]: Sharon on zoom.

1852
02:38:47,715 --> 02:38:48,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening, everyone.

1853
02:38:48,776 --> 02:38:50,037
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Sharon DSO.

1854
02:38:50,097 --> 02:38:51,458
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you can hear me clearly.

1855
02:38:51,478 --> 02:38:55,161
[SPEAKER_08]: I would be there in person.

1856
02:38:55,181 --> 02:38:59,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1857
02:39:01,066 --> 02:39:03,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Sharon DSO, I hope you can hear me clearly.

1858
02:39:03,488 --> 02:39:07,150
[SPEAKER_08]: I would be there in person.

1859
02:39:07,170 --> 02:39:11,214
[SPEAKER_08]: I would gladly be there in person.

1860
02:39:12,374 --> 02:39:15,397
[SPEAKER_08]: But I had a long day in the dentist chair today.

1861
02:39:16,576 --> 02:39:22,239
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to make a comment briefly by that woman who spoke a little while ago.

1862
02:39:22,299 --> 02:39:41,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Her last initial is also a D. Someone at the city council mentioned earlier that they gladly signed with their name the letter recently going to the state house, meaning our residents, and they went to a local college.

1863
02:39:43,015 --> 02:39:50,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, to the best of my knowledge, ladies and gentlemen, I teach literature in composition.

1864
02:39:50,718 --> 02:39:54,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Our residents, like our children, means each and every one.

1865
02:39:54,979 --> 02:39:59,501
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not each and every one of us were represented in that letter by consent.

1866
02:40:00,161 --> 02:40:02,642
[SPEAKER_08]: But moving on to something a little bit more important.

1867
02:40:03,923 --> 02:40:06,104
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm on the same line with Mr. Penta.

1868
02:40:07,364 --> 02:40:07,944
[SPEAKER_08]: This issue,

1869
02:40:13,459 --> 02:40:19,686
[SPEAKER_08]: First, how many people last year applied to affordable housing?

1870
02:40:20,086 --> 02:40:24,931
[SPEAKER_08]: How many people have been in stress or in waiting on the list?

1871
02:40:25,972 --> 02:40:31,098
[SPEAKER_08]: We should have this meeting in conjunction with the head of housing of Medford.

1872
02:40:31,498 --> 02:40:35,903
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a very bold move, I feel, and may seem slight to you.

1873
02:40:36,767 --> 02:40:47,691
[SPEAKER_08]: However, I think it's a domino effect and it affects many, many homeowners and people who may be transient and have to move after a short stay here.

1874
02:40:48,412 --> 02:40:51,933
[SPEAKER_08]: And however, like the realtors mentioned too, it affects them.

1875
02:40:52,773 --> 02:40:55,355
[SPEAKER_08]: There are many additives in this domino effect.

1876
02:40:55,795 --> 02:40:58,776
[SPEAKER_08]: This should be shoved right out of the council tonight.

1877
02:40:59,720 --> 02:41:07,963
[SPEAKER_08]: It should be reworded also that that paper should be retracted from the state house stating representing our residents.

1878
02:41:10,144 --> 02:41:12,425
[SPEAKER_08]: And I also thank you for your time.

1879
02:41:12,445 --> 02:41:22,649
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm hoping we don't see this issue for a very long time until we see numbers, figures, and directors of affordable housing in this city.

1880
02:41:23,149 --> 02:41:23,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1881
02:41:23,630 --> 02:41:26,791
[SPEAKER_15]: In address for record, please.

1882
02:41:29,241 --> 02:41:30,542
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1883
02:41:30,582 --> 02:41:32,483
[SPEAKER_11]: Gaston Fiore, 61 Stigny Road.

1884
02:41:33,303 --> 02:41:39,566
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm just very concerned about the processes, as I said.

1885
02:41:39,646 --> 02:41:45,049
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just wrote the following, which are just facts.

1886
02:41:45,189 --> 02:41:50,252
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would like to engage at the end if there are any questions.

1887
02:41:51,212 --> 02:41:55,155
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's start with what has been said.

1888
02:41:55,935 --> 02:42:00,258
[SPEAKER_11]: During the city council meeting on March 12th, some city councilors said the following.

1889
02:42:00,618 --> 02:42:03,360
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Leming said, quote, another quote,

1890
02:42:21,212 --> 02:42:39,831
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Collins said, quote, as Councilor Leming said, what's before us tonight is whether we want to have the conversation about how to tailor this tool to dedicate a small percentage of only the highest ticket real estate transactions towards the most underinvested in housing in our community, end quote.

1891
02:42:40,751 --> 02:42:42,432
[SPEAKER_11]: Another quote, I want to be clear.

1892
02:42:42,692 --> 02:42:47,154
[SPEAKER_11]: If we vote this into committee tonight, then we can and we will get into the weeds.

1893
02:42:47,654 --> 02:42:57,878
[SPEAKER_11]: With the community, we can discuss how to tailor this to affect the appropriate type of highest value sales just to capture a small percentage of huge value increases that have come into this region, end quote.

1894
02:42:58,658 --> 02:43:09,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Callahan said, quote, we literally don't have a single word written about what kind of transfer fee we would do because we can't until we get a number and we send it to committee.

1895
02:43:09,921 --> 02:43:14,703
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is going to take months because we're going to take a lot of input from the committee, end quote.

1896
02:43:14,923 --> 02:43:17,943
[SPEAKER_11]: Another quote, I know way too much about state politics.

1897
02:43:18,124 --> 02:43:26,266
[SPEAKER_11]: I can tell you that of any communities that have passed a real estate transfer fee, as with many other housing related issues, the state does not approve them.

1898
02:43:27,006 --> 02:43:32,990
[SPEAKER_11]: So what is going to happen is, we're lucky enough to pass anything that is related to a real estate transfer fee, it will not be approved by the state.

1899
02:43:33,511 --> 02:43:37,734
[SPEAKER_11]: The only thing likely to come out through the state is what is going to be very similar to Governor Healey's proposition.

1900
02:43:37,774 --> 02:43:40,556
[SPEAKER_11]: Governor Healey's proposition, just so you know, is 1% on either side.

1901
02:43:40,716 --> 02:43:47,140
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing will affect anyone who sells a house for less than a million dollars, and the only tax is on what is over a million dollars.

1902
02:43:47,160 --> 02:43:49,742
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you sell your house for 1.1 million dollars, the total tax for you is $1,000.

1903
02:43:49,782 --> 02:43:50,302
[SPEAKER_11]: So you know,

1904
02:43:51,363 --> 02:44:09,487
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope I can assuage some people's fears, and I really hope we can have a respectful discussion tonight, and that you can all participate in our many months long discussion that we hopefully will be about to begin, that will happen in perfectly open meetings, which we'll invite you all to come to.

1905
02:44:10,407 --> 02:44:10,747
[SPEAKER_11]: end quote.

1906
02:44:11,488 --> 02:44:15,531
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, let's turn to what has been done, not said, done.

1907
02:44:16,031 --> 02:44:27,900
[SPEAKER_11]: On April 16th, City Council President Bears and Vice President Collins signed a letter addressed to the state's legislature in support of the provisions to enable local option transfer fees in Governor Healey's H4138, the Affordable Homes Act.

1908
02:44:29,901 --> 02:44:43,128
[SPEAKER_11]: The letter urged state legislators to pay particular attention to the inclusion of several components, including a provision to allow municipalities to apply fees to the full amount of transactions.

1909
02:44:44,089 --> 02:44:48,291
[SPEAKER_11]: I repeat, to apply fees to the full amount of transactions.

1910
02:44:49,491 --> 02:44:50,132
[SPEAKER_11]: So I ask,

1911
02:44:51,479 --> 02:44:59,162
[SPEAKER_11]: How did we arrive at just a chasm between what has been said to us in the city council meeting and what has been signed and sent to state legislatures?

1912
02:44:59,783 --> 02:45:11,428
[SPEAKER_11]: How did we get from wanting to discuss every single detail regarding a possible implementation of a transfer fee to already signing a letter to the state legislature in support of such fees?

1913
02:45:12,068 --> 02:45:22,331
[SPEAKER_11]: How did we get from wanting to target only the highest value real estate transactions to sign in a letter in support of allowing the fee to apply to the full amount of transactions?

1914
02:45:22,911 --> 02:45:33,575
[SPEAKER_11]: How did we get from saying that we shouldn't have fear because any real estate transfer fee that passes the city council will not be approved by the state to sign in a letter to lobby the state to allow such transfer fees?

1915
02:45:34,415 --> 02:45:35,896
[SPEAKER_11]: I do certainly know one thing, though.

1916
02:45:36,136 --> 02:45:40,017
[SPEAKER_11]: I personally lost all trust that I had in most members of this city council.

1917
02:45:40,137 --> 02:45:40,918
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1918
02:45:40,938 --> 02:45:41,338
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1919
02:45:41,438 --> 02:45:42,458
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm happy to respond.

1920
02:45:43,659 --> 02:45:45,460
[SPEAKER_15]: I think a few things are being conflated.

1921
02:45:45,640 --> 02:45:58,345
[SPEAKER_15]: So what we were talking about on March 12th was a home rule petition for this city council to craft a request to the state to allow Just Medford to implement a real estate transfer fee.

1922
02:45:59,105 --> 02:46:01,426
[SPEAKER_15]: You were quoting me and saying, those things don't pass.

1923
02:46:01,666 --> 02:46:03,087
[SPEAKER_15]: I completely agree with that.

1924
02:46:03,668 --> 02:46:04,448
[SPEAKER_15]: It was it was Anna.

1925
02:46:04,708 --> 02:46:05,288
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought it was me.

1926
02:46:05,429 --> 02:46:05,989
[SPEAKER_15]: So sorry.

1927
02:46:06,569 --> 02:46:08,270
[SPEAKER_15]: I basically think the same thing.

1928
02:46:09,791 --> 02:46:22,518
[SPEAKER_15]: If we were to have the committee meeting on the Home Rule petition, we were to report it out of committee, the mayor were to send it to the legislature, but probably go in the same place that the other 18 Home Rule petitions have gone, which is the trash bin.

1929
02:46:24,289 --> 02:46:26,210
[SPEAKER_15]: Separately, there's three things at play here.

1930
02:46:26,330 --> 02:46:32,234
[SPEAKER_15]: There's the home rule petition by the city council and the mayor to request permission for the city to do something.

1931
02:46:32,854 --> 02:46:39,699
[SPEAKER_15]: There's the legislation that is at the state house, which would authorize all cities and towns to implement something.

1932
02:46:39,719 --> 02:46:42,540
[SPEAKER_15]: And then there's what ordinance we would actually pass in the city.

1933
02:46:44,381 --> 02:46:46,443
[SPEAKER_15]: I support local control on this issue.

1934
02:46:47,501 --> 02:46:55,477
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that the state should give cities and towns, all of them the permission, including what was in that letter, to implement whatever transfer fee those cities and towns want to implement.

1935
02:46:56,904 --> 02:47:04,888
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think that my position on what we should implement in Medford should constrain what the people of Nantucket want to implement in Nantucket.

1936
02:47:05,769 --> 02:47:11,331
[SPEAKER_15]: So I support a broad local option allowing cities and towns to do something that they want to do.

1937
02:47:11,692 --> 02:47:15,634
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't think that we should impose our conditions and our politics on other communities.

1938
02:47:15,734 --> 02:47:18,455
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that all communities should have the local control on this issue.

1939
02:47:19,175 --> 02:47:23,958
[SPEAKER_15]: What you quoted at the beginning is what all of us said, we would be comfortable passing in Medford.

1940
02:47:24,994 --> 02:47:28,476
[SPEAKER_15]: which is high-end transactions targeted at the high-end real estate.

1941
02:47:29,277 --> 02:47:30,177
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's three pieces.

1942
02:47:30,978 --> 02:47:34,920
[SPEAKER_15]: I support a broad local option for all cities and towns to implement a transfer fee.

1943
02:47:35,641 --> 02:47:43,626
[SPEAKER_15]: That's different because I believe cities and towns need a lot more authority because the state constrains our authority to do basically anything, so we aren't able to address the problems that people have.

1944
02:47:44,554 --> 02:47:50,038
[SPEAKER_15]: That's entirely different from what ordinance on a transfer fee I think Medford should pass if we were given that authority.

1945
02:47:50,538 --> 02:47:55,162
[SPEAKER_15]: So those are the three pieces, and I hope that clarifies my position on the issue.

1946
02:47:57,403 --> 02:48:01,046
[SPEAKER_11]: So my view on that is that let's assume that, you know,

1947
02:48:03,968 --> 02:48:06,910
[SPEAKER_11]: I oppose, I'm against theft, right?

1948
02:48:07,551 --> 02:48:12,715
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think theft should be, I'm talking in general, it could be something else like murder or something, I don't know, putting an example.

1949
02:48:13,255 --> 02:48:14,416
[SPEAKER_11]: I think theft should be illegal.

1950
02:48:14,997 --> 02:48:30,289
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm not gonna, you know, sign a letter where I'm saying like, well, you know what, I actually, I'm against theft, but I'm gonna let it, I'm gonna let every city decide for themselves whether I want theft, whether they want theft to be illegal or not.

1951
02:48:30,509 --> 02:48:31,290
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I won't.

1952
02:48:31,870 --> 02:48:34,952
[SPEAKER_11]: I am against theft and I think theft should be illegal.

1953
02:48:35,152 --> 02:48:43,037
[SPEAKER_11]: So why do you support a letter in your capacity as an individual to apply the transfer fee to the full amount of transactions?

1954
02:48:43,157 --> 02:48:50,622
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, so if I basically don't think that a transfer fee should apply to the full amount of transactions, I don't think it should apply anywhere.

1955
02:48:50,682 --> 02:48:53,084
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want someone... I just think it shouldn't apply in Mexico.

1956
02:48:54,084 --> 02:48:56,286
[SPEAKER_15]: I just think that the full amount should not be here in Medford.

1957
02:48:56,406 --> 02:48:59,288
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think that I should impose my opinion on the people of another city.

1958
02:49:00,629 --> 02:49:01,630
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's my position.

1959
02:49:01,650 --> 02:49:06,533
[SPEAKER_15]: I support local control for communities, and I also have specific opinions about what I believe Medford should implement.

1960
02:49:06,754 --> 02:49:08,375
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I respect your opinion.

1961
02:49:08,415 --> 02:49:15,820
[SPEAKER_11]: I just think that, again, if someone opposes something, then it's based on conviction, and then that shouldn't apply anywhere else.

1962
02:49:15,840 --> 02:49:16,761
[SPEAKER_15]: And I have two convictions.

1963
02:49:16,841 --> 02:49:19,503
[SPEAKER_15]: One is local control, and one is what the ordinance should look like in the city.

1964
02:49:19,523 --> 02:49:19,903
[SPEAKER_15]: That's fine.

1965
02:49:19,923 --> 02:49:20,223
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1966
02:49:20,323 --> 02:49:22,165
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Collins, since you also signed the letter.

1967
02:49:23,302 --> 02:49:24,002
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, President Barras.

1968
02:49:24,703 --> 02:49:25,644
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you for speaking to this.

1969
02:49:26,004 --> 02:49:43,556
[SPEAKER_31]: And again, this is similar to what I said before, but I again want to reinforce, I know that you disagree with, I'm sorry, through the chair, I know that many constituents disagree with me about my opinion on the transfer fee, the Home Rule petition, the Affordable Homes Act, which are again, two separate, totally separate processes about the same topic.

1970
02:49:44,977 --> 02:49:46,798
[SPEAKER_31]: That's your right, completely respect that.

1971
02:49:46,898 --> 02:49:49,500
[SPEAKER_31]: I know that there's a lot that we disagree on and a lot that we agree on.

1972
02:49:50,120 --> 02:49:52,382
[SPEAKER_31]: But the thing that I really think is important to reinforce

1973
02:49:53,038 --> 02:49:56,281
[SPEAKER_31]: is that we are talking about two different things.

1974
02:49:57,502 --> 02:50:02,066
[SPEAKER_31]: We are all endowed with the right to endorse a piece of state-level legislation.

1975
02:50:02,546 --> 02:50:04,528
[SPEAKER_31]: I think we've probably all done that at different times.

1976
02:50:05,228 --> 02:50:06,469
[SPEAKER_31]: And there's a separate process.

1977
02:50:06,489 --> 02:50:07,110
[SPEAKER_31]: Or oppose.

1978
02:50:07,130 --> 02:50:07,550
[SPEAKER_31]: Or oppose.

1979
02:50:08,591 --> 02:50:19,340
[SPEAKER_31]: And there is a separate process by which we come together as a city council in committee meetings to collectively, in public session, craft what we are actually putting forward to the state house to say,

1980
02:50:19,824 --> 02:50:26,189
[SPEAKER_31]: the majority of city councilors voted for this, that we would like for you to put forward as state legislation.

1981
02:50:26,930 --> 02:50:46,627
[SPEAKER_31]: And I hope that, I'm trying to find the words to make this more clear, because I understand that it's confusing for a lot of people, that the Affordable Homes Act, which is a massive housing bond bill that also includes a proposal for a local option for real estate transfer fee, encounters the same topic as our proposed real estate

1982
02:50:47,096 --> 02:50:50,718
[SPEAKER_31]: transfer fee home rule petition that is currently in the permitting and planning committee.

1983
02:50:50,778 --> 02:50:55,481
[SPEAKER_31]: I understand that those are easy to conflate because there's that Venn diagram overlap.

1984
02:50:56,822 --> 02:51:12,291
[SPEAKER_31]: And I just want to reinforce for people who are not as deeply intimate with this issue as all of us behind the rail are and the people who most frequently show up to the public meetings, I just want to make it crystal clear that these are two separate processes.

1985
02:51:13,171 --> 02:51:14,212
[SPEAKER_31]: They're related by topic.

1986
02:51:14,687 --> 02:51:17,988
[SPEAKER_31]: They're two separate processes, and I just think that's really important to make clear.

1987
02:51:18,388 --> 02:51:30,393
[SPEAKER_31]: And if I may, while I have the floor, as we're talking about the processes with possible home rule petitions, I think the most important part of this conversation already happened, which is how do these actually happen?

1988
02:51:30,593 --> 02:51:31,293
[SPEAKER_31]: What's the process?

1989
02:51:32,274 --> 02:51:33,654
[SPEAKER_31]: City Council goes to the mayor.

1990
02:51:33,834 --> 02:51:35,815
[SPEAKER_31]: They could full stop at the mayor.

1991
02:51:35,935 --> 02:51:38,356
[SPEAKER_31]: If they don't, they go to the delegation.

1992
02:51:38,736 --> 02:51:40,457
[SPEAKER_31]: They get put forward as a legislation.

1993
02:51:41,701 --> 02:51:55,289
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't like to talk about this often because I think that we should do them anyway, but yeah, I have no optimism that the Home Rule petition that we may or may not craft here in Medford City Council will become law because traditionally they don't.

1994
02:51:56,432 --> 02:52:02,194
[SPEAKER_31]: I've been a member of home, I've been a participant in home rule petition efforts in my first term on the Medford City Council.

1995
02:52:02,234 --> 02:52:04,195
[SPEAKER_31]: Did any of them become law or get even close?

1996
02:52:04,795 --> 02:52:05,756
[SPEAKER_31]: No, absolutely not.

1997
02:52:06,396 --> 02:52:11,518
[SPEAKER_31]: But, you know, to use the words of somebody who spoke just earlier, I don't think that this is a slight issue at all, the housing crisis.

1998
02:52:11,538 --> 02:52:12,739
[SPEAKER_31]: I think that it's a major issue.

1999
02:52:13,099 --> 02:52:13,959
[SPEAKER_31]: And that's why I think that's it.

2000
02:52:14,644 --> 02:52:37,551
[SPEAKER_31]: That's why I think it's so important that we have the conversation with every mechanism possible, including lobbying for state-level legislation, as well as having the conversation about if we should lobby for this, essentially, with a home rule petition, because the issue of displacement and housing unaffordability is so large and so rampant in Medford that I really think it's worth having that conversation anyway.

2001
02:52:38,572 --> 02:52:38,832
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

2002
02:52:39,432 --> 02:52:43,133
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would note that we voted seven to zero on the pilot legislation.

2003
02:52:43,789 --> 02:52:45,630
[SPEAKER_15]: which is getting wiped out every session.

2004
02:52:46,451 --> 02:52:52,774
[SPEAKER_15]: Because we think it's a good idea, even though we don't have confidence that the State House will actually approve the legislation.

2005
02:52:53,475 --> 02:52:54,215
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Callahan.

2006
02:52:55,356 --> 02:52:57,517
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, Councilor Lemmie, Councilor- yeah, my bad.

2007
02:52:58,638 --> 02:53:00,719
[SPEAKER_15]: We usually have a button and it would show me a list.

2008
02:53:01,780 --> 02:53:03,821
[SPEAKER_15]: So, we're getting that back.

2009
02:53:07,907 --> 02:53:13,654
[SPEAKER_18]: No, when I've chaired meetings before, I've definitely like not noticed like which side of my or you just picked the hand that went up last.

2010
02:53:15,361 --> 02:53:19,303
[SPEAKER_18]: No, so just to be a bit more clear about the practicalities of this.

2011
02:53:19,463 --> 02:53:32,147
[SPEAKER_18]: So if the Affordable Homes Act does end up including a provision for us to implement a local option for a real estate transfer fee, the home rule petition proposal in Medford would be moot.

2012
02:53:32,207 --> 02:53:41,511
[SPEAKER_18]: There just wouldn't really be any point in filing that because we would then have, we would then have it by default what the state gives us.

2013
02:53:41,571 --> 02:53:43,012
[SPEAKER_18]: So we would likely have to file

2014
02:53:44,472 --> 02:53:53,080
[SPEAKER_18]: another resolution into a regular meeting in that case and just drop the Home Rule petition if we do get it from the Affordable Homes Act.

2015
02:53:53,160 --> 02:53:59,245
[SPEAKER_18]: So hopefully that just clarifies sort of what the process looks like because

2016
02:54:00,873 --> 02:54:18,421
[SPEAKER_18]: The 18 Home Rule petitions that have been filed, if you actually go and read them, and they're all on the State House website, they're all kind of slightly different and they're a little bit, they just have very different provisions depending on what individual city councils discussed at any given time.

2017
02:54:18,681 --> 02:54:24,163
[SPEAKER_18]: And so if the Affordable Homes Act is passed, all of those would probably just be rejected.

2018
02:54:25,126 --> 02:54:30,925
[SPEAKER_18]: outright officially because then, you know, everybody would have what the state gave them.

2019
02:54:31,953 --> 02:54:40,615
[SPEAKER_18]: That being said, just to, again, repeat what my colleagues have already stated, there is a definite point in filing these.

2020
02:54:41,135 --> 02:54:54,278
[SPEAKER_18]: The fact that 18 other communities all filed Home Rule petitions very likely is telling the State House that affordable housing is an issue, and all of that effort by local legislators then led up

2021
02:54:54,878 --> 02:54:57,940
[SPEAKER_18]: to what Governor Healey's proposing with the Affordable Homes Act.

2022
02:54:58,260 --> 02:55:05,825
[SPEAKER_18]: So the relationship between local and state politics is often a bit of a black box, but yeah.

2023
02:55:06,405 --> 02:55:11,488
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

2024
02:55:13,289 --> 02:55:15,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, through the chair.

2025
02:55:15,971 --> 02:55:20,654
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand that many constituents oppose a real estate transfer fee and that

2026
02:55:22,156 --> 02:55:42,570
[SPEAKER_05]: know to make an analogy with theft makes it makes it seem like something of conviction uh for or against something i think a much better analogy is a minimum wage law so in california and other states cities can pass any kind of minimum wage law they want to in massachusetts we cannot um i would sign a something at the state level saying

2027
02:55:42,950 --> 02:55:49,815
[SPEAKER_05]: please allow any city or town in Massachusetts to pass any minimum wage that they deem necessary in their own city.

2028
02:55:50,215 --> 02:55:54,098
[SPEAKER_05]: But that doesn't mean that I would want an infinity minimum wage in Medford, right?

2029
02:55:54,498 --> 02:56:03,545
[SPEAKER_05]: So you vote, you push for the state to enable you, it's called enabling legislation, to enable you to pass the laws that are correct for your community.

2030
02:56:03,905 --> 02:56:09,589
[SPEAKER_05]: And then within your community, you have the discussion about what would be the right minimum wage for Medford?

2031
02:56:10,734 --> 02:56:24,087
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is the question that we are having, which is, you know, we are about to begin a long discussion, including the public, about what kind of real estate transfer fee might be the right one for Medford.

2032
02:56:24,447 --> 02:56:34,517
[SPEAKER_05]: But that doesn't mean that individual sitting elected officials who also, by the way, have websites that declare that they, you know, people run on issues.

2033
02:56:35,745 --> 02:56:40,127
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there are things that are on my website that are issues that I support and I ran on those issues.

2034
02:56:40,227 --> 02:56:43,969
[SPEAKER_05]: I told people when I was running that I would support those issues.

2035
02:56:44,289 --> 02:56:47,931
[SPEAKER_05]: That is why I got elected, because those things were on my website at that time.

2036
02:56:48,411 --> 02:56:58,457
[SPEAKER_05]: And as city councilors and other elected officials to sign in support of the state, allowing communities to make whatever decision they want doesn't mean that

2037
02:56:59,824 --> 02:57:06,567
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, I'm gonna support a $500 minimum wage in Medford, even if I think that any community should be able to have any kind of minimum wage they want.

2038
02:57:06,888 --> 02:57:14,031
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just think that that analogy-wise, it's a better analogy that we want the state to allow us to make those decisions.

2039
02:57:15,872 --> 02:57:16,032
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.

2040
02:57:17,353 --> 02:57:21,215
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further comment by members of the council?

2041
02:57:21,295 --> 02:57:22,796
[SPEAKER_15]: We have Martha Andres on Zoom.

2042
02:57:23,396 --> 02:57:24,977
[SPEAKER_15]: Martha, name and address for the record, please.

2043
02:57:31,465 --> 02:57:33,086
[SPEAKER_15]: Martha, for some reason we can't hear you.

2044
02:57:40,428 --> 02:57:41,988
[SPEAKER_15]: You're unmuted, but we can't hear you.

2045
02:57:47,510 --> 02:57:48,550
[SPEAKER_15]: Could someone check with Shane?

2046
02:57:50,751 --> 02:57:51,611
[SPEAKER_15]: We still can't hear you.

2047
02:57:55,332 --> 02:57:56,633
[SPEAKER_18]: Justin, can you try saying something?

2048
02:57:58,133 --> 02:57:58,713
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you hear me?

2049
02:57:59,594 --> 02:58:00,294
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep, we can hear you.

2050
02:58:01,516 --> 02:58:03,738
[SPEAKER_15]: Martha, it looks like there might be an issue with your microphone.

2051
02:58:11,222 --> 02:58:14,745
[SPEAKER_15]: You may need to join audio or reset your microphone.

2052
02:58:14,785 --> 02:58:16,566
[SPEAKER_15]: In the meantime, I will go to the podium.

2053
02:58:17,667 --> 02:58:19,328
[SPEAKER_15]: Eileen Lerner, name and address for the record, please.

2054
02:58:23,331 --> 02:58:26,892
[SPEAKER_26]: My name is Eileen Lerner and I live at 9 Adams Circle.

2055
02:58:28,053 --> 02:58:36,976
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'm a part of Medford too, even though I've only lived here 10 years, I'm part of Medford too.

2056
02:58:37,756 --> 02:58:39,957
[SPEAKER_26]: And Medford has changed a great deal.

2057
02:58:40,557 --> 02:58:46,499
[SPEAKER_26]: There are great many people who support the Councilors right here.

2058
02:58:47,523 --> 02:58:49,404
[SPEAKER_26]: And that has to be accepted.

2059
02:58:49,524 --> 02:58:53,126
[SPEAKER_26]: You can't say that they don't represent us.

2060
02:58:53,626 --> 02:58:55,007
[SPEAKER_26]: We voted for them.

2061
02:58:55,888 --> 02:58:57,148
[SPEAKER_26]: We approve of them.

2062
02:58:58,029 --> 02:58:58,889
[SPEAKER_26]: We love them.

2063
02:58:59,510 --> 02:59:01,771
[SPEAKER_26]: They're doing what we want them to do.

2064
02:59:02,491 --> 02:59:04,752
[SPEAKER_26]: We need affordable housing in this city.

2065
02:59:05,313 --> 02:59:12,336
[SPEAKER_26]: I've had friends who have been so in despair because they can't find a plumber, they can't find an electrician.

2066
02:59:13,057 --> 02:59:16,419
[SPEAKER_26]: And if those kinds of people have to come from New Hampshire,

2067
02:59:17,299 --> 02:59:24,608
[SPEAKER_26]: to serve us, they're going to charge us a lot more money than they would if they lived in Medford, you know.

2068
02:59:24,709 --> 02:59:32,939
[SPEAKER_26]: So one way or another, we're going to be paying for the lack of economic diversity in this city.

2069
02:59:34,201 --> 02:59:36,483
[SPEAKER_26]: We have to find a way to discuss it.

2070
02:59:36,944 --> 02:59:52,302
[SPEAKER_26]: And we need to have all the things on the table and to try to figure out what's best for Medford and stop attacking our Councilors that we voted for by a large majority.

2071
02:59:53,183 --> 02:59:55,504
[SPEAKER_26]: they represent Medford.

2072
02:59:56,184 --> 02:59:59,646
[SPEAKER_26]: Now, there may be people that feel that they're unrepresented.

2073
03:00:00,366 --> 03:00:02,047
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, I'm sorry about that.

2074
03:00:02,507 --> 03:00:05,328
[SPEAKER_26]: But sometimes things change.

2075
03:00:05,928 --> 03:00:08,709
[SPEAKER_26]: People's ideas about things change.

2076
03:00:09,070 --> 03:00:11,110
[SPEAKER_26]: What people want changes.

2077
03:00:11,831 --> 03:00:12,011
[SPEAKER_26]: So,

2078
03:00:13,228 --> 03:00:17,931
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, you can't ignore the people that voted for this council.

2079
03:00:17,991 --> 03:00:28,158
[SPEAKER_26]: You cannot ignore them and say that real Medford wants everything in opposition to what these people want.

2080
03:00:28,318 --> 03:00:29,499
[SPEAKER_26]: That is not true.

2081
03:00:29,559 --> 03:00:32,801
[SPEAKER_26]: There are a great many people who just support them.

2082
03:00:33,522 --> 03:00:37,184
[SPEAKER_26]: And I join with those people to support all of you.

2083
03:00:38,165 --> 03:00:38,625
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2084
03:00:39,046 --> 03:00:39,466
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2085
03:00:43,314 --> 03:00:46,336
[SPEAKER_19]: speaker, I appreciate you coming up to the podium.

2086
03:00:47,277 --> 03:00:53,982
[SPEAKER_21]: Like I said, it doesn't matter what he says, the vote's the vote.

2087
03:00:54,703 --> 03:00:56,944
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what this process is.

2088
03:00:56,964 --> 03:01:06,852
[SPEAKER_17]: The questions that the constituents that reached out to me were with the process, because I believe this council

2089
03:01:14,870 --> 03:01:16,650
[SPEAKER_17]: There is an issue with affordable housing.

2090
03:01:18,451 --> 03:01:19,852
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's how we're getting there.

2091
03:01:20,552 --> 03:01:22,113
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just a philosophical difference.

2092
03:01:22,813 --> 03:01:33,258
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that our administration has done a terrible job using their responsibilities and their powers to bring affordable housing.

2093
03:01:33,378 --> 03:01:36,820
[SPEAKER_17]: I think they've done a terrible job over the last five years.

2094
03:01:36,860 --> 03:01:37,200
[SPEAKER_17]: Terrible.

2095
03:01:38,381 --> 03:01:39,341
But no one, right?

2096
03:01:45,859 --> 03:01:46,279
[SPEAKER_17]: colleagues.

2097
03:01:47,220 --> 03:01:52,425
[SPEAKER_17]: So as the Councilors that want to pay for it, they have to look at what you've got right here.

2098
03:02:17,366 --> 03:02:17,646
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2099
03:02:17,666 --> 03:02:18,527
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's go back to Martha.

2100
03:02:18,547 --> 03:02:19,288
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's try this again.

2101
03:02:19,328 --> 03:02:20,689
[SPEAKER_15]: Martha, name and address for the record, please.

2102
03:02:22,251 --> 03:02:23,492
[SPEAKER_15]: We still can't hear you, Martha.

2103
03:02:24,212 --> 03:02:36,444
[SPEAKER_15]: There is a phone call in on the agenda if you want to try to call in by phone and we could recognize you if you go to the agenda on the city website or on our agenda and meeting portal, but we can't hear you right now.

2104
03:02:37,188 --> 03:02:42,311
[SPEAKER_18]: Martha, you could also try to click on the little arrow next to the microphone button.

2105
03:02:42,331 --> 03:02:44,732
[SPEAKER_18]: It could be that your input is wrong.

2106
03:02:44,812 --> 03:02:50,135
[SPEAKER_18]: So sometimes Zoom selects a different input than what's the default on your computer.

2107
03:02:50,155 --> 03:02:51,515
[SPEAKER_18]: So that could be the issue.

2108
03:02:52,336 --> 03:02:52,716
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks.

2109
03:02:53,176 --> 03:02:54,797
[SPEAKER_15]: Martha, we'll try to come back to you again.

2110
03:02:54,817 --> 03:02:57,459
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to go to Bill on Zoom.

2111
03:02:59,420 --> 03:03:01,301
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address for the record, please.

2112
03:03:02,241 --> 03:03:03,822
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi, Bill Giglio, Winthrop Street.

2113
03:03:04,471 --> 03:03:06,131
[SPEAKER_27]: Can we get just a quick comment?

2114
03:03:06,151 --> 03:03:08,412
[SPEAKER_27]: Can we stop calling this a fee?

2115
03:03:08,432 --> 03:03:13,773
[SPEAKER_27]: What it really is is the tax or basically staling from homeowners.

2116
03:03:14,654 --> 03:03:15,574
[SPEAKER_27]: That's pretty much all it is.

2117
03:03:15,874 --> 03:03:16,794
[SPEAKER_27]: It's not a fee.

2118
03:03:17,354 --> 03:03:19,295
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, we're not getting anything from it.

2119
03:03:19,395 --> 03:03:20,195
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, we have to give.

2120
03:03:20,915 --> 03:03:24,616
[SPEAKER_27]: So it's actually staling from a homeowner, to be honest with you.

2121
03:03:24,656 --> 03:03:25,836
[SPEAKER_27]: But it's not a fee.

2122
03:03:25,936 --> 03:03:29,357
[SPEAKER_27]: It's either you can either call it a tax or a high fee.

2123
03:03:29,437 --> 03:03:29,777
[SPEAKER_27]: That's all.

2124
03:03:32,258 --> 03:03:32,658
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2125
03:03:35,080 --> 03:03:35,902
[SPEAKER_15]: Martha, you want to try again?

2126
03:03:35,922 --> 03:03:36,663
[SPEAKER_15]: You're still unmuted.

2127
03:03:42,711 --> 03:03:46,516
[SPEAKER_15]: Go back to the podium, Gaston, and if you don't mind, we're on the second round.

2128
03:03:46,536 --> 03:03:49,060
[SPEAKER_15]: If we could just keep it a little shorter, but yeah, thank you.

2129
03:03:51,983 --> 03:03:59,807
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to clarify, I mean, I've said this several times, like, I understand that there's a housing affordability issue.

2130
03:03:59,827 --> 03:04:04,110
[SPEAKER_11]: I've said this like several, several times, so I'm not against affordable housing.

2131
03:04:04,150 --> 03:04:04,970
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be ridiculous.

2132
03:04:05,510 --> 03:04:12,374
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't want to be portrayed as because I oppose a transfer fee or tax, that I'm against affordable housing.

2133
03:04:12,494 --> 03:04:13,855
[SPEAKER_11]: I support affordable housing.

2134
03:04:15,416 --> 03:04:22,801
[SPEAKER_11]: The problem, as I've said also before, is that imposing a sales tax on real estate transactions is not going to lower housing prices.

2135
03:04:23,622 --> 03:04:25,703
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, it will do the opposite, resulting in setting higher prices.

2136
03:04:25,723 --> 03:04:33,989
[SPEAKER_11]: The tax might generate revenue for affordable housing, which is a different thing, but it will also make entering the housing market more expensive for average buyers.

2137
03:04:36,462 --> 03:04:37,362
[SPEAKER_11]: This is easy to understand.

2138
03:04:37,382 --> 03:04:43,903
[SPEAKER_11]: When an X percent sales tax is imposed on real estate transactions, the direct effect is that buyers will need to pay an additional X percent of the transaction cost.

2139
03:04:44,003 --> 03:04:56,346
[SPEAKER_11]: If housing demand remains constant, which we will, or if supply constraints exist, which will keep existing, then sellers have less incentive to lower the prices, leading generally to higher overall costs in the housing market for buyers.

2140
03:04:56,846 --> 03:05:01,267
[SPEAKER_11]: Even if the government forces a sales tax to be imposed on sellers, which was part of that letter too,

2141
03:05:02,677 --> 03:05:07,703
[SPEAKER_11]: The sellers may increase the sales price to offset the tax cost indirectly passing this expense to buyers.

2142
03:05:08,284 --> 03:05:12,549
[SPEAKER_11]: Thus, the interaction with sales tax increases the financial burden on buyers rather than decreasing housing costs.

2143
03:05:12,589 --> 03:05:17,314
[SPEAKER_11]: And to conclude, to address the housing affordability problem effectively, which I support,

2144
03:05:18,395 --> 03:05:23,897
[SPEAKER_11]: The focus should be on increasing the supply of housing rather than manipulating market prices through taxation.

2145
03:05:24,478 --> 03:05:38,243
[SPEAKER_11]: This can be achieved by reducing regulatory barriers that constrain development of new housing units such as zoning laws and lengthy permit processes, encouraging the development of more housing through deregulation with increased supply leading to lower prices through natural market competition.

2146
03:05:38,443 --> 03:05:42,525
[SPEAKER_11]: This approach not only fosters economic efficiency but also enhances consumer choice.

2147
03:05:43,405 --> 03:05:45,126
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm in favor of affordable housing.

2148
03:05:45,326 --> 03:05:51,367
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not in favor of the particular non-solution to affordable housing that you're proposing.

2149
03:05:51,387 --> 03:06:09,513
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't you agree that they're, depending on the structure of the transfer fee and what the threshold was and what the number of units would have applied to, therefore restricting the parcels and structures that would be considered, there could be substitution effects that would change the who would be the buyer, and that that may be a preferential outcome for the city?

2150
03:06:09,833 --> 03:06:11,754
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that that's more dictated to the market.

2151
03:06:11,814 --> 03:06:11,914
[SPEAKER_11]: I see.

2152
03:06:11,954 --> 03:06:12,234
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2153
03:06:14,301 --> 03:06:14,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, go ahead.

2154
03:06:15,082 --> 03:06:15,322
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, sorry.

2155
03:06:15,582 --> 03:06:18,384
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that would be more dictated by the particular market that we are dealing with.

2156
03:06:18,484 --> 03:06:21,467
[SPEAKER_11]: So if it's a seller's market, it will actually be passed to the buyer.

2157
03:06:21,647 --> 03:06:27,111
[SPEAKER_11]: And if it's like a market where, you know, basically it's a buyer's market, then that might be passed to the seller.

2158
03:06:27,291 --> 03:06:29,553
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, I disagree with that.

2159
03:06:29,573 --> 03:06:30,654
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I get it.

2160
03:06:30,674 --> 03:06:31,835
[SPEAKER_15]: You just used the word average buyer.

2161
03:06:31,875 --> 03:06:33,796
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we're talking about corporate transactions.

2162
03:06:34,917 --> 03:06:35,698
[SPEAKER_11]: Corporate transactions?

2163
03:06:35,998 --> 03:06:38,560
[SPEAKER_15]: If we're talking about large buyers, those would not be the average buyer.

2164
03:06:39,013 --> 03:06:39,454
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no.

2165
03:06:39,494 --> 03:06:41,756
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm assuming that, well, okay.

2166
03:06:41,776 --> 03:06:43,958
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we're gonna talk about specific, we can discuss them.

2167
03:06:43,978 --> 03:06:44,659
[SPEAKER_11]: We probably should have.

2168
03:06:44,679 --> 03:06:45,280
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, you're right.

2169
03:06:45,680 --> 03:06:48,303
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, Councilor Kelly and then Council Vice President Collins.

2170
03:06:49,664 --> 03:06:57,653
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to remind everyone that we are discussing the process dealing with possible home rule petitions.

2171
03:06:58,694 --> 03:07:00,175
[SPEAKER_05]: It is very important to me

2172
03:07:01,280 --> 03:07:17,977
[SPEAKER_05]: that comments made by constituents who are knowledgeable, who should be heard from, and comments made by members of this committee who also are knowledgeable and who should be heard from, all of those comments should be heard by the public at a meeting where they know that this is going to be discussed.

2173
03:07:18,973 --> 03:07:25,998
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I do not have the authority under the Supreme Judicial Court to police the content at the podium, and I also have a simultaneous duty as the chair to state facts.

2174
03:07:26,638 --> 03:07:31,342
[SPEAKER_15]: So sometimes that will be in dispute with the principle you just said, but I generally agree with the principle that you just stated.

2175
03:07:31,862 --> 03:07:32,703
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Collins.

2176
03:07:35,885 --> 03:07:37,586
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, President Bears and Councilor Callahan.

2177
03:07:37,606 --> 03:07:42,510
[SPEAKER_31]: I appreciate you refocusing us on the actual text of our discussion.

2178
03:07:42,530 --> 03:07:45,792
[SPEAKER_31]: So I just want to make one further comment, and then I will

2179
03:07:49,025 --> 03:07:53,548
[SPEAKER_31]: the question again, I guess, though I feel more confused about the meaning of that motion than I did a half hour ago.

2180
03:07:54,368 --> 03:07:57,190
[SPEAKER_31]: But I think that we've had a robust discussion on this topic.

2181
03:07:57,670 --> 03:08:10,077
[SPEAKER_31]: But in terms of the, I think, the most important part of our discussion about the processes of dealing with possible home rule petitions is just the technical process, like the universe of what can happen with home rule petitions, which we already talked about.

2182
03:08:11,358 --> 03:08:15,981
[SPEAKER_31]: But just as speaking about these home rule petitions in particular,

2183
03:08:16,525 --> 03:08:32,235
[SPEAKER_31]: as the chair of the planning and permitting committee, which they are both assigned to, in terms of what residents can expect from these home rule petitions in particular, and because the issue of, and because the concept of what else are we doing about affordable housing just got brought up.

2184
03:08:32,295 --> 03:08:41,141
[SPEAKER_31]: I agree, I certainly would never assume that people who don't happen to endorse the idea of a real estate transfer fee are not proponents of increasing affordable housing.

2185
03:08:42,728 --> 03:08:46,791
[SPEAKER_31]: Most of politics is just disagreeing over the tactics and not the outcomes or goals.

2186
03:08:47,712 --> 03:09:07,248
[SPEAKER_31]: And to that end, my expectation as chair of the committee in which a lot of these affordable housing conversations are going on is that we have, this is also the committee in which we are discussing our slate of major comprehensive amendments to our zoning code.

2187
03:09:07,688 --> 03:09:08,649
[SPEAKER_31]: And that gets brought up a lot.

2188
03:09:08,689 --> 03:09:12,292
[SPEAKER_31]: People talk about making it easier for developers to build in Medford

2189
03:09:12,534 --> 03:09:18,418
[SPEAKER_31]: both to increase our commercial tax base, to make it easier to add new high quality residential units.

2190
03:09:19,779 --> 03:09:24,802
[SPEAKER_31]: We are going to lay the conditions for that to happen through updating our zoning code.

2191
03:09:25,923 --> 03:09:27,964
[SPEAKER_31]: Speaking as the chair of the committee, that is my priority.

2192
03:09:28,304 --> 03:09:34,208
[SPEAKER_31]: This is something that this council has been working on, I know, for at least two terms, which means one term longer than I've been a part of the council.

2193
03:09:36,155 --> 03:09:39,177
[SPEAKER_31]: pivotal work that we are going to be doing on this committee, that's my priority.

2194
03:09:39,397 --> 03:09:54,849
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't expect to take up these formal petitions until the fall because we have a budget to pass in May and in June, and we have a lot of work to get through with our zoning consultant, which this council fought for, for, I'm gonna say, at least three calendar years.

2195
03:09:56,630 --> 03:10:01,914
[SPEAKER_31]: I think we're so serious about the issue of housing affordability that when we say every tool in the toolbox, we really mean it.

2196
03:10:02,619 --> 03:10:06,860
[SPEAKER_31]: We're going to talk about zoning that will make it easier to develop commercially and residentially in Medford.

2197
03:10:07,300 --> 03:10:14,081
[SPEAKER_31]: We're going to talk about ADUs, which I know are really important, you know, kind of on the minds of many Medford residents.

2198
03:10:14,581 --> 03:10:24,083
[SPEAKER_31]: And we're also going to talk about home rule petitions, but the work that is squarely within our jurisdiction, zoning, as chair, I'm always going to prioritize that.

2199
03:10:24,283 --> 03:10:31,304
[SPEAKER_31]: And so in terms of the process, in terms of the timeline that people can expect, I just want to, I want, I feel like, I thought this was a,

2200
03:10:32,150 --> 03:10:59,321
[SPEAKER_31]: a topical time to bring that up, both in terms of the timing that people can expect these to go over and also to just kind of recontextualize these formal petitions with everything else that this council is prioritizing to do with the outcome of increasing affordable housing in Medford and also increasing the commercial development that will expand our resources to support our residents and all manner of other infrastructural and constituent services project.

2201
03:11:01,271 --> 03:11:01,791
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2202
03:11:02,231 --> 03:11:03,852
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further discussion by members of the council?

2203
03:11:11,035 --> 03:11:12,016
[SPEAKER_15]: Approve what?

2204
03:11:12,476 --> 03:11:14,297
[SPEAKER_31]: Just on the motion to receive and place on file.

2205
03:11:14,377 --> 03:11:18,819
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion to receive and place on file by Councilor Collins, seconded by?

2206
03:11:18,839 --> 03:11:21,560
[SPEAKER_15]: Seconded by Councilor Leming.

2207
03:11:23,201 --> 03:11:26,262
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you amend it to report it out or it's just we discussed it?

2208
03:11:26,282 --> 03:11:27,423
[SPEAKER_15]: We discussed it.

2209
03:11:27,583 --> 03:11:28,043
[SPEAKER_15]: Got it, okay.

2210
03:11:28,063 --> 03:11:29,724
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, I just wanted to make sure we didn't have anything

2211
03:11:30,560 --> 03:11:31,281
[SPEAKER_15]: that needed to go out.

2212
03:11:31,301 --> 03:11:33,603
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Kirk, please call the roll.

2213
03:11:34,604 --> 03:11:34,764

[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2218
03:11:46,789 --> 03:11:48,309
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I have the affirmative, none the negative.

2219
03:11:48,329 --> 03:11:49,690
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion is received and placed on file.

2220
03:11:49,710 --> 03:11:50,590
[SPEAKER_15]: President Bears?

2221
03:11:50,710 --> 03:11:52,010
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, Vice President Collins.

2222
03:11:52,190 --> 03:11:55,611
[SPEAKER_31]: I would make a motion to join and approve the food truck permits.

2223
03:11:55,911 --> 03:11:57,151
[SPEAKER_31]: That's papers 24-086 through 24-091.

2224
03:11:57,251 --> 03:11:58,111
[SPEAKER_31]: I heard that, George.

2225
03:11:58,131 --> 03:11:58,931
[SPEAKER_31]: Now I'm mad.

2226
03:11:58,951 --> 03:12:00,152
[SPEAKER_31]: It's all over now.

2227
03:12:14,688 --> 03:12:25,137
[SPEAKER_15]: on the motion of Vice President Collins to join papers 24086, 24087, 24088, 24089, 24090, and 24091 and approve.

2228
03:12:25,518 --> 03:12:26,338
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'll just read those.

2229
03:12:26,819 --> 03:12:32,324
[SPEAKER_15]: These are requests for Hormel Stadium food trucks, requests for a food truck permit for Penny Packers, May 4th at Hormel Stadium.

2230
03:12:32,344 --> 03:12:33,264
[SPEAKER_15]: They are fantastic.

2231
03:12:34,085 --> 03:12:36,027
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure the rest of them are, but I know that one.

2232
03:12:37,008 --> 03:12:39,190
[SPEAKER_15]: Food truck permit for Trolley Dogs, May 17th, 2024 at Hormel Stadium.

2237
03:12:59,828 --> 03:13:04,169
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, could you let me know, is this related to the Boston Glory, the Frisbee team that's playing at Hormel Stadium?

2238
03:13:04,789 --> 03:13:06,890
[SPEAKER_15]: It most certainly is, and the clerk loves it.

2239
03:13:10,132 --> 03:13:13,494
[SPEAKER_15]: He would like to be requested to throw out the first toss.

2240
03:13:13,834 --> 03:13:17,217
[SPEAKER_21]: Apparently, the PDS director has already thrown out the first toss.

2241
03:13:17,357 --> 03:13:17,597
[SPEAKER_15]: I know.

2242
03:13:17,637 --> 03:13:18,477
[SPEAKER_15]: Has already done the first toss.

2243
03:13:18,497 --> 03:13:20,459
[SPEAKER_15]: Add a great slight to the clerk and this council.

2244
03:13:20,679 --> 03:13:22,860
[SPEAKER_21]: No slight whatsoever to the clerk.

2245
03:13:22,881 --> 03:13:27,043
[SPEAKER_21]: There we go.

2246
03:13:27,063 --> 03:13:32,427
[SPEAKER_21]: The clerk will be attending many of these matches, however.

2247
03:13:32,767 --> 03:13:37,231
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion to join and approve by Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

[SPEAKER_15]: We have two things in unfinished business.

2264
03:13:59,711 --> 03:14:00,891
[SPEAKER_15]: Council Vice President Collins.

2265
03:14:01,392 --> 03:14:13,779
[SPEAKER_31]: Motion to take from the table 22494, the budget ordinance for third reading, and to take from the table 24080, the supervisor of water and sewer personnel ordinance.

2266
03:14:16,042 --> 03:14:16,803
[SPEAKER_15]: On the second one.

2267
03:14:17,244 --> 03:14:17,484
[SPEAKER_15]: Got it.

2268
03:14:17,604 --> 03:14:23,351
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion of Vice President Collins to take papers 22494 and 2224080 off the table.

2269
03:14:24,392 --> 03:14:25,433
[SPEAKER_15]: Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

2270
03:14:25,453 --> 03:14:26,194
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2271
03:14:52,210 --> 03:14:53,231
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2272
03:14:54,372 --> 03:14:54,572
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2273
03:14:55,413 --> 03:14:56,113
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2274
03:14:57,254 --> 03:14:57,474
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2275
03:14:58,215 --> 03:14:58,935
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2276
03:14:59,096 --> 03:14:59,356
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2277
03:14:59,656 --> 03:15:06,542
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, from the negative.

2278
03:15:06,562 --> 03:15:07,683
[SPEAKER_15]: They're taking off the table.

2279
03:15:07,703 --> 03:15:19,933
[SPEAKER_15]: 22494 is the button budget ordinance first in City Council after I believe six or seven committee meetings at which it was duly debated, discussed in public for an incredibly long

2280
03:15:21,554 --> 03:15:27,618
[SPEAKER_15]: this is a budget that was proposed in, uh, 12 months.

2281
03:15:27,658 --> 03:15:28,419
[SPEAKER_15]: Um 2 to 494 initially proposed in 2022.

2282
03:15:29,160 --> 03:15:31,742
[SPEAKER_15]: Um this budget ordinance we are now following for this year.

2283
03:15:32,282 --> 03:15:38,707
[SPEAKER_15]: It codifies into law, a process by which the council and the mayor's office will collaborate on the budget.

2284
03:15:39,367 --> 03:15:43,690
[SPEAKER_15]: We have been having preliminary budget meetings much earlier than we have in the past, and we are hearing from our

2285
03:15:50,856 --> 03:15:58,561
[SPEAKER_15]: and we have now had some timely financial reporting, and the ordinance requires further timely financial reporting going forward in all future years.

2286
03:15:59,221 --> 03:16:03,104
[SPEAKER_15]: So that is, I think, a significant improvement over some recent conditions.

2287
03:16:03,804 --> 03:16:07,947
[SPEAKER_15]: And with that, we approved it for first reading on March 19th, 2024.

2288
03:16:08,487 --> 03:16:17,633
[SPEAKER_15]: It was advertised in the Medford Transcript and Summerville Journal on April 11th, 2024, and it is now eligible for a third reading today, Tuesday, April 30th, 2024.

2289
03:16:17,773 --> 03:16:19,334
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion on the floor?

2290
03:16:21,792 --> 03:16:25,054
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Vice President Collins to approve for third reading, seconded by.

2291
03:16:25,134 --> 03:16:25,394
[SPEAKER_22]: Second.

2292
03:16:25,815 --> 03:16:26,935
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2293
03:16:27,196 --> 03:16:28,696
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2294
03:16:29,797 --> 03:16:31,798
[SPEAKER_21]: To approve for third reading to be ordained.

2295
03:16:31,838 --> 03:16:33,319
[SPEAKER_15]: To be ordained, indeed.

2296
03:16:35,081 --> 03:16:35,721
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Callahan.

2297
03:16:35,801 --> 03:16:35,961
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2298
03:16:36,501 --> 03:16:37,362
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Collins.

2299
03:16:37,382 --> 03:16:37,562
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2300
03:16:38,022 --> 03:16:38,803
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Lazzaro.

2301
03:16:39,003 --> 03:16:39,203
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2302
03:16:39,643 --> 03:16:40,224
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Leming.

2303
03:16:40,424 --> 03:16:40,644
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2304
03:16:40,964 --> 03:16:41,605
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2305
03:16:41,625 --> 03:16:41,725
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2306
03:16:42,906 --> 03:16:43,446
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Tseng.

2307
03:16:43,926 --> 03:16:44,166
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2308
03:16:44,927 --> 03:16:45,547
[SPEAKER_21]: President Bears.

2309
03:16:45,687 --> 03:16:45,928
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2310
03:16:46,008 --> 03:16:47,188
[SPEAKER_15]: And the affirmative, none the negative.

2311
03:16:47,248 --> 03:16:49,230
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion passes and the budget ordinance is ordained.

2312
03:16:51,638 --> 03:16:59,887
[SPEAKER_15]: 24080, the amendment proposed by the mayor, April 16th, 2024, to the personnel ordinance to increase the position of the supervisor of water and sewer.

2313
03:17:01,409 --> 03:17:02,390
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess I better get it right.

2314
03:17:02,810 --> 03:17:05,653
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it was from PW 18 to 19, but we can check.

2315
03:17:07,676 --> 03:17:08,477
[SPEAKER_20]: Give me one moment.

2316
03:17:19,013 --> 03:17:19,874
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's what it is.

2317
03:17:19,914 --> 03:17:28,663
[SPEAKER_15]: It is the motion to amend language of PW 18 shall be amended to remove the following position and language of PW 19 be amended to include the following position supervisor of water and sewer.

2318
03:17:29,464 --> 03:17:35,471
[SPEAKER_15]: We did receive a communication from the administration that there is not an active arbitration of grievance claim on this, and I believe.

2319
03:17:38,120 --> 03:17:43,481
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli has moved to waive the three readings and move for approval for third reading this evening.

2320
03:17:44,281 --> 03:17:49,142
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Callahan, is there any objection by any councilor?

2321
03:17:49,182 --> 03:17:51,582
[SPEAKER_15]: It does require unanimous vote to waive all three readings.

2322
03:17:53,343 --> 03:18:03,365
[SPEAKER_15]: Seeing none, on the motion to ordain, to approve for third reading and ordain this change to the personnel ordinance by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

2323
03:18:04,165 --> 03:18:05,065
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the vote.

2324
03:18:07,574 --> 03:18:08,255
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Callahan?

2325
03:18:08,335 --> 03:18:08,495
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2326
03:18:09,736 --> 03:18:10,597
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Collins?

2327
03:18:10,757 --> 03:18:10,917
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2328
03:18:11,458 --> 03:18:12,359
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Lazzaro?

2329
03:18:12,459 --> 03:18:12,679
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2330
03:18:13,460 --> 03:18:14,040
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Leming?

2331
03:18:14,120 --> 03:18:14,361
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2332
03:18:15,101 --> 03:18:15,722
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2333
03:18:15,742 --> 03:18:15,822
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2334
03:18:16,443 --> 03:18:17,003
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Tseng?

2335
03:18:17,424 --> 03:18:17,644
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2336
03:18:18,825 --> 03:18:19,425
[SPEAKER_21]: President Bears?

2337
03:18:19,926 --> 03:18:20,767
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I'm in the affirmative.

2338
03:18:20,787 --> 03:18:21,407
[SPEAKER_15]: None in the negative.

2339
03:18:21,487 --> 03:18:22,228
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

2340
03:18:22,308 --> 03:18:26,753
[SPEAKER_15]: And we just spent four minutes doing lawmaking, which was nice.

2341
03:18:30,283 --> 03:18:40,732
[SPEAKER_15]: And I mean to say that very specifically because often the most important work we do happens at the end of a meeting after 10 or 15 public meetings.

2342
03:18:41,413 --> 03:18:47,058
[SPEAKER_15]: And we just passed a budget ordinance for the first time in the city, so I'm very happy about that.

2343
03:18:47,578 --> 03:18:49,120
[SPEAKER_15]: There is public participation.

2344
03:18:50,469 --> 03:18:52,511
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there anyone who'd like to speak in public participation?

2345
03:18:52,531 --> 03:18:56,454
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have one person who'd like to speak in public participation.

2346
03:18:56,474 --> 03:18:58,696
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address for the record, please.

2347
03:18:59,156 --> 03:19:01,799
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Sam Goldstein, 29 Martin Street, Medford.

2348
03:19:01,819 --> 03:19:03,300
[SPEAKER_12]: Can folks hear me?

2349
03:19:03,760 --> 03:19:04,441
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, we can hear you.

2350
03:19:05,064 --> 03:19:15,230
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I wanted to raise to the council that there's a rumor going on that the Medford police are going to be used to break up a peaceful demonstration on Tufts campus tonight.

2351
03:19:16,031 --> 03:19:18,572
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, you know, I don't know if this is going to happen or not.

2352
03:19:18,692 --> 03:19:21,094
[SPEAKER_12]: But I want to say that

2353
03:19:21,594 --> 03:19:29,682
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe students have clearly a First Amendment right to peaceably assemble and to speak.

2354
03:19:30,963 --> 03:19:33,826
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a right that it tops to pay $90,000 a year for.

2355
03:19:35,987 --> 03:19:46,057
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm dismayed that the city resources are potentially going to be used in such a manner to break up a peaceful demonstration.

2356
03:19:47,138 --> 03:20:03,076
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to say that I hope that Mayor Lungo-Koehn doesn't allow this to happen, and to also ask what it is that the City Council can do to make it clear that perhaps this should not be happening, or to

2357
03:20:09,157 --> 03:20:16,498
[SPEAKER_12]: at least voice some concern for the rights of these students who seem to be in jeopardy this evening.

2358
03:20:17,435 --> 03:20:18,256
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for your comment.

2359
03:20:18,876 --> 03:20:21,518
[SPEAKER_15]: I can just speak for myself and Vice President Collins.

2360
03:20:21,758 --> 03:20:22,578
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll just speak for myself.

2361
03:20:22,618 --> 03:20:23,359
[SPEAKER_15]: You can speak for yourself.

2362
03:20:23,839 --> 03:20:34,225
[SPEAKER_15]: I have been in communication with the mayor and the Medford police since Friday about this issue and trying to liaise with protesters to implore Tufts to reach a negotiated solution.

2363
03:20:35,666 --> 03:20:41,910
[SPEAKER_15]: And I also do not support the use of public resources to address this protest by force.

2364
03:20:45,773 --> 03:20:46,373
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Collins.

2365
03:20:46,769 --> 03:20:47,510
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

2366
03:20:47,530 --> 03:20:51,395
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you for bringing this forward to this forum.

2367
03:20:53,032 --> 03:21:02,636
[SPEAKER_31]: Along with President Bears, I've also been made aware of the situation by protesters on Tufts campus and people working with them, supportive of their cause.

2368
03:21:02,676 --> 03:21:06,237
[SPEAKER_31]: Just community members who have noticed this going on over the past few days.

2369
03:21:06,257 --> 03:21:08,678
[SPEAKER_31]: I've tried to remain in contact with those organizers.

2370
03:21:09,259 --> 03:21:15,741
[SPEAKER_31]: Also been in contact with our mayor, chief of police, and the government affairs liaison on Tufts campus about this.

2371
03:21:16,842 --> 03:21:22,224
[SPEAKER_31]: I've been very clear with all of those leaders and decision makers that my opinion is that

2372
03:21:24,244 --> 03:21:37,889
[SPEAKER_31]: This is, it would be a insupportable use of city resources to deploy Medford police to break up what has been a peaceful and unproblematic student demonstration.

2373
03:21:37,909 --> 03:21:50,094
[SPEAKER_31]: This is not germane to the use of our city resources, but as a Tufts alumnus, I'm very proud to see the students there joining into this cascade of peaceful demonstrations across the nation.

2374
03:21:52,392 --> 03:22:16,836
[SPEAKER_31]: And speaking as a community representative, I am deeply concerned about the safety of students and other community members on campus should the Tufts administration decide that a forcible removal of protesters is the objective that they are going to accomplish by use of force and by use of Tufts University Police.

2375
03:22:17,216 --> 03:22:18,537
[SPEAKER_31]: I hope that it doesn't come to that.

2376
03:22:19,957 --> 03:22:21,137
[SPEAKER_31]: I pray that it doesn't come to that.

2377
03:22:22,257 --> 03:22:23,378
[SPEAKER_31]: I think that that would end badly.

2378
03:22:24,039 --> 03:22:39,711
[SPEAKER_31]: I think that we've seen on other campuses that this is an extenuating event that should be allowed to remain a peaceful demonstration, a gathering place, a place for students and community members to process what's going on, to gather together and to show their solidarity.

2379
03:22:40,931 --> 03:22:47,997
[SPEAKER_31]: I think that it would be, I would hate to see something so benign

2380
03:22:48,999 --> 03:23:00,262
[SPEAKER_31]: speaking here as an individual community member, and again, speaking as a Jewish person, I would hate to see something so benign be escalated because of the use of police force in breaking up a peaceful protest.

2381
03:23:00,782 --> 03:23:15,926
[SPEAKER_31]: And so I'll reiterate my message to our administration and Tufts administration that I unequivocally would condemn the use of police force, whether Tufts or Medfords, especially Medfords, to forcibly decamp the protesters

2382
03:23:16,851 --> 03:23:24,143
[SPEAKER_31]: from where they have been camping out, gathering, making food, celebrating Passover on the Tufts University academic quad.

2383
03:23:25,366 --> 03:23:25,586
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

2384
03:23:26,445 --> 03:23:26,885
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2385
03:23:26,925 --> 03:23:34,288
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would just add that there are other campuses that have been able to reach agreements with protesters to maintain the protests.

2386
03:23:34,528 --> 03:23:36,789
[SPEAKER_15]: And I believe that Tufts has the capacity to do the same thing.

2387
03:23:37,289 --> 03:23:49,593
[SPEAKER_15]: I would also add, speaking directly to the conversation that we had tonight about the number of city resources that go to Tufts when they do not pay property taxes, that is particularly galling that they would ask us to use them to displace protesters.

2388
03:23:50,654 --> 03:23:51,154
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Lazzaro.

2389
03:23:52,809 --> 03:24:09,083
[SPEAKER_06]: From what I've read about the reasoning behind the interest in removing the protesters from the tough squad also is that I think that there can be some justifications made for use of force in removing protesters.

2390
03:24:09,143 --> 03:24:16,610
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not saying that I necessarily agree with this, but that it would be for blockage of traffic or some

2391
03:24:19,144 --> 03:24:27,329
[SPEAKER_06]: danger posed to the public, but this is on Tufts property and only for the purpose of setting up for commencement.

2392
03:24:29,350 --> 03:24:44,599
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would definitely caution the Medford Police Department that it really doesn't seem to be the business of our administration or our Medford police to be involved in that.

2393
03:24:48,251 --> 03:24:58,119
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is a big national movement that's happening and that students should be allowed to express their opinions and practice their First Amendment rights.

2394
03:25:00,302 --> 03:25:10,665
[SPEAKER_06]: And just as an anecdotal story, I was in the car listening to NPR when they were talking about police removing protesters from Columbia University.

2395
03:25:10,705 --> 03:25:13,025
[SPEAKER_06]: And my nine-year-old said, is protesting illegal?

2396
03:25:13,085 --> 03:25:14,886
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said, no, it is not.

2397
03:25:15,746 --> 03:25:17,346
[SPEAKER_06]: It is very much not illegal to protest.

2398
03:25:18,666 --> 03:25:19,887
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's all I'll say about that.

2399
03:25:20,007 --> 03:25:20,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2400
03:25:21,687 --> 03:25:21,907
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2401
03:25:21,947 --> 03:25:23,588
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further comment by members of the Council?

2402
03:25:25,208 --> 03:25:27,229
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further discussion by Vice President Collins?

2403
03:25:27,629 --> 03:25:28,669
[SPEAKER_31]: Sorry, just one thing to add.

2404
03:25:29,741 --> 03:25:38,408
[SPEAKER_31]: I know a couple people have reached out to me saying, what can the city council do about this to make sure that the people demonstrating on Tufts campus are kept safe?

2405
03:25:38,648 --> 03:25:42,851
[SPEAKER_31]: As we often say, the city council instructs and commands no city staff.

2406
03:25:43,912 --> 03:25:49,036
[SPEAKER_31]: There's very little that we can, there's nothing that we can do to interfere formally, or sorry, I shouldn't say interfere.

2407
03:25:49,056 --> 03:25:50,698
[SPEAKER_31]: There's nothing that we can do directly.

2408
03:25:52,099 --> 03:26:18,013
[SPEAKER_31]: to affect what happens on Tufts campus, but I would say to constituents that are observing this meeting, if you are of the opinion one way or the other on how Medford police resources should be deployed, if you feel that they should not be used to disperse a peaceful encampment on the grounds of a private university, if you feel that's inappropriate, now would be a good time to let the administration know.

2409
03:26:18,033 --> 03:26:19,054
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

2410
03:26:19,954 --> 03:26:20,315
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2411
03:26:22,362 --> 03:26:24,145
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further comment by members of the public?

2412
03:26:25,086 --> 03:26:28,251
[SPEAKER_15]: Seeing none in the chamber, I will go to Bill Giglio on Zoom.

2413
03:26:34,561 --> 03:26:36,524
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi, Bill Giglio, Winthrop Street.

2414
03:26:39,908 --> 03:26:51,518
[SPEAKER_27]: So, you may tell you nine year old also that it is illegal for the Columbia students that are breaking into buildings, taking over buildings, smashing glasses with him, that's illegal.

2415
03:26:53,288 --> 03:26:56,212
[SPEAKER_27]: So I do want to say I 100% support the police being there.

2416
03:26:56,512 --> 03:26:57,433
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm happy they're there.

2417
03:26:57,814 --> 03:26:59,055
[SPEAKER_27]: I hope they're there in full force.

2418
03:26:59,095 --> 03:27:05,964
[SPEAKER_27]: We see what's going on around these campuses, the violence, the, you know, everything that's going on.

2419
03:27:06,004 --> 03:27:09,108
[SPEAKER_27]: So I want to thank the police for for for being there.

2420
03:27:09,888 --> 03:27:11,748
[SPEAKER_27]: And we've also seen this in Boston as well.

2421
03:27:12,109 --> 03:27:21,491
[SPEAKER_27]: And I hope anyone that goes outside the lines of protest and is arrested, I hope they're fully prosecuted, which they usually they usually just let go.

2422
03:27:22,031 --> 03:27:26,772
[SPEAKER_27]: But in any event, I really hope that the police is there in full force and I appreciate our police force.

2423
03:27:26,812 --> 03:27:27,132
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

2424
03:27:32,113 --> 03:27:33,553
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Castagnetti.

2425
03:27:35,854 --> 03:27:37,734
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Castagnetti name and address.

2426
03:27:38,573 --> 03:27:38,993
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, sir.

2427
03:27:39,673 --> 03:27:41,234
[SPEAKER_23]: Peaceful protesting is cool.

2428
03:27:41,314 --> 03:27:43,795
[SPEAKER_23]: I've done it since 1967.

2429
03:27:44,615 --> 03:27:52,818
[SPEAKER_23]: However, if it starts to cross the line becomes mostly peaceful, then we have a, how you say, a safety problem.

2430
03:27:53,438 --> 03:27:54,899
[SPEAKER_23]: Then that's a different ballgame.

2431
03:27:55,639 --> 03:27:56,499
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you for listening.

2432
03:27:57,319 --> 03:27:57,820
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2433
03:27:57,880 --> 03:28:00,461
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to adjourn seconded by Councilor Nishikawa.

2434
03:28:00,501 --> 03:28:01,301
[SPEAKER_15]: Please call the roll.

2435
03:28:04,312 --> 03:28:04,872
[SPEAKER_21]: That's Kellyanne.

2436
03:28:04,972 --> 03:28:05,152
