1
00:02:14,278 --> 00:02:17,199
[SPEAKER_09]: budget hearings, which were five of them.

2
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:26,422
[SPEAKER_09]: It took place on May 9th, 10th, 16th, 25th, and June 6th in the formulation of the district's proposal of a budget request.

3
00:02:27,082 --> 00:02:29,103

[SPEAKER_09]: If we could please call the roll.

5
00:02:31,744 --> 00:02:32,044

[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?

[SPEAKER_09]: Present.

18
00:02:46,597 --> 00:02:47,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Seven present, zero absent.

19
00:02:48,018 --> 00:02:50,879
[SPEAKER_09]: If we all could rise to salute the flag.

20
00:02:51,620 --> 00:03:01,104
[SPEAKER_04]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

21
00:03:02,865 --> 00:03:09,188
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll turn it over to Superintendent Edouard-Vincent and Mr. Dave Murphy, Superintendent of Finance.

22
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:10,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Assistant Superintendent of Finance.

23
00:03:11,786 --> 00:03:12,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, everyone.

24
00:03:12,687 --> 00:03:18,831
[SPEAKER_03]: I am very excited to be at this formal public hearing for our budget.

25
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:23,555
[SPEAKER_03]: So this evening, Mr. Murphy is going to take us through a slide deck.

26
00:03:23,615 --> 00:03:28,498
[SPEAKER_03]: You each should have received it this evening, describing where we are right now.

27
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,801
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you, Mr. Murphy.

28
00:03:31,821 --> 00:03:35,344
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, superintendent, mayor, members of the school committee.

29
00:03:35,364 --> 00:03:39,587
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pleasure to be with you again to discuss our FY23 budget.

30
00:03:42,585 --> 00:03:48,530
[SPEAKER_01]: This evening is our formal and statutorily obligatory public hearing.

31
00:03:48,750 --> 00:04:07,145
[SPEAKER_01]: And so depending on the level of public participation, I will keep my opening comments as brief as possible, understanding that on your agenda for your business meeting later this evening, there is another and potentially final FY23 preparation update.

32
00:04:08,146 --> 00:04:08,506
[SPEAKER_01]: And so

33
00:04:09,453 --> 00:04:16,682
[SPEAKER_01]: What I what I'd like to do if it works for the mayor for the committee is to talk a little bit about our process that has gotten us to this point.

34
00:04:17,603 --> 00:04:27,414
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I will pause and if there are public members of the public who would like to comment I would I would encourage the committee to allow that at that time.

35
00:04:28,007 --> 00:04:37,860
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can either go into greater detail now as part of the hearing, or we can save that for later in your meeting.

36
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:44,368
[SPEAKER_01]: Either way, with it being an agenda item, I'll be happy to take questions at that time, and I would probably recommend that your formal vote.

37
00:04:44,728 --> 00:05:01,876
[SPEAKER_01]: to take place when it comes up in your agenda, but so as to not make some of the community members who may be participating remotely wait too long, I would suggest that we talk a little bit about process and then move on to the comments.

38
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:10,160
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mayor, if that works for you, I'm gonna move forward with that understanding.

39
00:05:14,488 --> 00:05:19,614
[SPEAKER_01]: So again this is a slide that the committee is what point of order member.

40
00:05:19,634 --> 00:05:25,201
[SPEAKER_08]: But often sorry we missed the good of the order again with good of the order will be on 6 PM agenda.

41
00:05:25,521 --> 00:05:25,842
[SPEAKER_07]: I see it.

42
00:05:32,692 --> 00:05:33,072
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.

43
00:05:33,873 --> 00:05:57,491
[SPEAKER_01]: So this slide is one that I've shared with you many times before, and it outlines the sequence that we as an administration and you as a school committee walk through throughout the late winter and throughout the spring, leading into the summer months, as we prepare for a new fiscal year.

44
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,192
[SPEAKER_01]: And it begins with the establishment

45
00:05:59,948 --> 00:06:06,391
[SPEAKER_01]: of the district's strategic plan and identification of goals that we believe will advance that plan.

46
00:06:07,351 --> 00:06:18,116
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there was a surveying process in which we took the committee and the members of the administration's feedback to bring the sort of specific priorities and initiatives that we felt would be important in FY23.

47
00:06:18,576 --> 00:06:26,800
[SPEAKER_01]: That was followed by our five budget meetings that took place beginning in early May and concluding last week in which

48
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:32,656
[SPEAKER_01]: We discussed the various components of the budget, the rationale behind the budgetary priorities, so on and so forth.

49
00:06:33,076 --> 00:06:41,845
[SPEAKER_01]: On May 25, the school committee took a vote to request a budgetary package of the municipal government that was estimated at that time.

50
00:06:42,355 --> 00:07:02,166
[SPEAKER_01]: to be 72.5 million dollars estimated 72.5 billion dollars I mentioned at the time that that that all of these numbers were being continuously vetted and scrubbed and so there was possible that they'd be some fluctuation but that was an important milestone in the budget process because it gives the committee the opportunity to.

51
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:15,034
[SPEAKER_01]: articulate clearly to the community and to the municipal government what, based on the information that we as an administration have provided, you believe to be the key priorities and budgetary goals for the upcoming fiscal year.

52
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:31,419
[SPEAKER_01]: From that point in time, the mayor has a responsibility to submit to the Medford City Council, as all mayors do under this particular form of municipal government in the Commonwealth, a number that is a recommended appropriation for the school department,

53
00:07:31,926 --> 00:07:36,766
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that time, you've heard me say many times that the administration has to prepare for all different contingencies.

54
00:07:37,185 --> 00:07:52,740
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our responsibility to go about a reconciliation process to identify how we're going to continue to advance those goals if in fact the ultimate recommended appropriation is less than the vote that was the number that was requested by the school committee.

55
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:59,526
[SPEAKER_01]: That number, there was a significant discrepancy between those two numbers as we discussed on June 6th.

56
00:07:59,987 --> 00:08:02,349
[SPEAKER_01]: That there was a discrepancy was not a surprise.

57
00:08:02,768 --> 00:08:15,150
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, as myself and the mayor discussed last week, a greater discrepancy than we were anticipating and certainly significantly greater than the discrepancy that we needed to reconcile going into the fiscal year 2022.

58
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:25,772
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this point in time, we have what we believe to be, what is our anticipated appropriation and the number that the Medford City Council will be considering it over the course of the coming weeks.

59
00:08:26,212 --> 00:08:28,793
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that appropriation that is made to the school department ultimately

60
00:08:29,555 --> 00:08:37,061
[SPEAKER_01]: is what the school committee has asked to adopt so that the administration can then go about our responsibility with respect to implementation.

61
00:08:37,481 --> 00:08:43,125
[SPEAKER_01]: So the number that we're expecting is we're commonly using, just hold off on that one slide for a second if you could, thank you.

62
00:08:43,926 --> 00:08:50,931
[SPEAKER_01]: The number that we are now anticipating right now is, it's about five or $6,000 short of $69 million.

63
00:08:50,971 --> 00:08:56,515
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thank you for your indulgence in allowing us just to refer to it as the $69 million number.

64
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:58,537
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that'll probably save us some time.

65
00:08:59,017 --> 00:09:04,679
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know the budgetary priorities that are included in that $69 million.

66
00:09:04,859 --> 00:09:15,023
[SPEAKER_01]: I will talk a little bit about the work that we did to reconcile those numbers in a second and sort of the strategies that we used, particularly for the community's benefit.

67
00:09:15,603 --> 00:09:23,366
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this next slide, I just wanted to make a couple of comments that I think are sort of unavoidable when we talk about this budgeting process.

68
00:09:24,027 --> 00:09:27,168
[SPEAKER_01]: And my hope is that to provide

69
00:09:28,425 --> 00:09:33,067
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, a certain level of clarity with respect to the context in which we're having this conversation.

70
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:52,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it is not uncommon in school budgeting processes for folks to make the comment that regardless of whether we're vetting, whatever our priorities are, that we just have to wait for the mayor to give quote the number and then we can move on and implement the budget.

71
00:09:53,257 --> 00:10:10,528
[SPEAKER_01]: And the problem with that approach, which is not uncommon, incidentally, and I have a, my sense is historically not particularly uncommon in Medford, is that it positions the school department, excuse me, the school committee to wear one of two hats.

72
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:16,852
[SPEAKER_01]: You can rubber stamp the number and go on your way to summer vacation.

73
00:10:17,876 --> 00:10:24,719
[SPEAKER_01]: or you can dig into the number and micromanage every single line item within that number that's established by the municipal government.

74
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,101
[SPEAKER_01]: And neither of those two practices are particularly helpful.

75
00:10:29,321 --> 00:10:39,806
[SPEAKER_01]: They're particularly constructive and they deprive the community of the opportunity to have a thorough, thoughtful discussion about the priorities and the goals of the school department.

76
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:45,369
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the process that has played out over the course of the past six or seven weeks has been an opportunity

77
00:10:45,948 --> 00:10:54,315
[SPEAKER_01]: the school administration to articulate clearly what are the goals that we're trying to advance and what are the resources that we think we need to advance those goals.

78
00:10:54,615 --> 00:11:13,029
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same time the reason that you've heard me say over and over and over again that the school administration has a responsibility to plan for all contingencies is because regardless of what the city's capacity is or frankly what the municipal government's priorities are, our responsibility is to continue to move the Medford public schools forward as an organization.

79
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:21,344
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I thank the committee, and I mean this sincerely, for the opportunity to have this thorough and thoughtful and I think transparent conversation.

80
00:11:21,925 --> 00:11:40,275
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same time, the fact that there's a discrepancy, while it is more significant than I am comfortable with, and we'll talk about that in bullet number two, and that frankly, any of us are comfortable with, this is a budget that we are going to make work, that we are going to operationalize, and we are going to continue to serve the interests of students.

81
00:11:41,317 --> 00:11:45,220
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's fair to it's okay to say that both of those two things are true.

82
00:11:46,121 --> 00:11:47,522
[SPEAKER_01]: With regard to the second bullet point.

83
00:11:47,983 --> 00:11:54,348
[SPEAKER_01]: It is also not uncommon in communities that are on such a tight budget as we are about to be to

84
00:11:54,798 --> 00:12:18,572
[SPEAKER_01]: for purposes of planning and because the in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, there is a June 15 deadline by which non professional teacher status teachers of which we typically employ somewhere between 100 and 130 of our some close to 500 teachers and just for full context, a non professional teacher status teacher would be and sort of common parlance referred to as someone without tenure.

85
00:12:19,544 --> 00:12:21,745
[SPEAKER_01]: In Massachusetts, under the law, it's professional teacher status.

86
00:12:21,785 --> 00:12:30,809
[SPEAKER_01]: And after three consecutive years working in a district, a teacher is afforded that professional teacher status with a significant number of statutory contractual rights.

87
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:40,012
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by June 15th, every school district has to either renew or non-renew their non-professional teacher status staff.

88
00:12:40,553 --> 00:12:43,934
[SPEAKER_01]: And without any notification, those individuals are automatically renewed.

89
00:12:44,594 --> 00:12:48,536
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the choice that every district has when we're in this type of budgetary predicament

90
00:12:49,335 --> 00:13:01,560
[SPEAKER_01]: is do we free up the budgetary capacity that we know we'll need and buy us additional time to determine exactly how we're going to implement this sizable budget of close to $70 million.

91
00:13:05,158 --> 00:13:07,879
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do we run the risk that we're going to figure out a way to do it?

92
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:26,085
[SPEAKER_01]: And the sort of easy way out, and I don't mean to, I'm not in any way casting, I'm not in any way mean to pass judgment on other districts or other decisions that have been made, but I think it's fair to say the easiest way from a budgetary perspective is to issue en masse non-renewals.

93
00:13:26,745 --> 00:13:29,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Because then after June 15th, we can then sort the rest of the budget out.

94
00:13:30,306 --> 00:13:31,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Most positions will be restored.

95
00:13:31,826 --> 00:13:33,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Most individuals will be invited back.

96
00:13:33,991 --> 00:13:41,994
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't have we're not up against that deadline that happens to coincide I don't probably not coincidentally with when the budget cycle is turning over right.

97
00:13:42,994 --> 00:13:48,536
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with doing that is that these non professional teacher status teachers.

98
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:55,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Are by and large dedicated educators who are in the early part of their career.

99
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:02,952
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to lay the foundation of a potential lengthy, fruitful, and contributive career in the Medford Public Schools.

100
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:16,017
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a routine form letter from the central office informing them of their non-renewal on the eve of June 15th on a yearly basis, I think has a significant detriment to our culture and climate.

101
00:14:16,758 --> 00:14:22,700
[SPEAKER_01]: And so despite the fact that we are at a razor's edge with respect to this year's budget, we're trying to avoid that.

102
00:14:24,501 --> 00:14:25,201
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time,

103
00:14:25,987 --> 00:14:32,850
[SPEAKER_01]: Given how close this budget is, we have no choice but to issue a limited number of budget-related non-renewal notices.

104
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:39,652
[SPEAKER_01]: And those conversations on a verbal basis took place last week between administrators and the individuals affected.

105
00:14:40,132 --> 00:14:41,293
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it is a limited number.

106
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:43,153
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not en masse.

107
00:14:43,413 --> 00:14:47,775
[SPEAKER_01]: There was some strategy and thoughtfulness behind how those determinations were made.

108
00:14:48,308 --> 00:15:03,259
[SPEAKER_01]: And as the budget picture stabilizes, and we'll talk a little bit about what variables need to be adjusted for that to happen, it is our hope that most, if not all of those positions will be restored, and where appropriate, individuals will be rehired.

109
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:12,306
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna just put those two structural pieces out there, and then we'll go to the last slide, and then I would encourage comments or questions.

110
00:15:13,052 --> 00:15:17,474
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, your original budgetary request was for $72.5 million.

111
00:15:17,554 --> 00:15:23,438
[SPEAKER_01]: The anticipated municipal appropriation is just under $69 million.

112
00:15:25,238 --> 00:15:26,839
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about a $4 million delta.

113
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:33,663
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way in which we've bridged that gap are one, the elimination of some

114
00:15:34,324 --> 00:15:36,405
[SPEAKER_01]: positions, as I just mentioned.

115
00:15:37,506 --> 00:15:46,091
[SPEAKER_01]: The identification of potential savings and areas of the budget in FY22 that we had some unrealized expenses.

116
00:15:47,592 --> 00:15:53,375
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say that the $69 million budget is by and large a level services budget.

117
00:15:54,788 --> 00:16:00,373
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I just said that there were some positions that were eliminated, but the goal is for the same level of service to be provided.

118
00:16:00,913 --> 00:16:07,158
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a few discrepancies that we need to, frankly, a little more time to strategize about how exactly we're going to do that.

119
00:16:07,818 --> 00:16:11,661
[SPEAKER_01]: It does have a 2% budgeted cost of living increase for all employees.

120
00:16:12,382 --> 00:16:20,508
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been a consistent refrain that you've heard throughout this budget process that our desire to maintain both competitiveness and sustainability.

121
00:16:21,796 --> 00:16:35,949
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there are a number of places in which we have identified grant funding opportunities for external funds or revolving funds, where appropriate to absorb some of those expenses to bring us in right at that $69 million number.

122
00:16:39,854 --> 00:16:41,496
[SPEAKER_01]: In a technical sense, a balanced budget.

123
00:16:42,777 --> 00:16:51,384
[SPEAKER_01]: We have reconciled those discrepancies as necessary to get to the number that we need to in order to be able to operationalize our anticipated appropriation.

124
00:16:53,026 --> 00:17:00,812
[SPEAKER_01]: The school administration has communicated to the city administration our hope that in the event there are additional funding sources identified that

125
00:17:02,493 --> 00:17:05,994
[SPEAKER_01]: that that will be considered and this number will be supplemented.

126
00:17:06,034 --> 00:17:07,755
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our hope, that's our request.

127
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:21,238
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, we understand that there are a variety of competing priorities and there's a limited capacity and we have a responsibility to move forward regardless of where that number is.

128
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:31,041
[SPEAKER_01]: Mayor, I think I would be inclined to stop here and see if there are questions that, if I could just review one thing very quickly.

129
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,842
[SPEAKER_01]: The next slide essentially is what I've already covered.

130
00:17:35,862 --> 00:17:44,669
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we want to put that up on the screen for a minute, but then if there are questions or comments, this would seem as good a time as any to field those.

131
00:17:54,896 --> 00:17:58,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau.

132
00:17:58,683 --> 00:17:59,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

133
00:18:00,564 --> 00:18:07,626
[SPEAKER_10]: Since I'm just getting the slides, are we going to, at some point, are we going to discuss the size of the fiscal cliff we're facing next year?

134
00:18:07,646 --> 00:18:10,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Or is that, you have too much to do right now to talk about that.

135
00:18:11,087 --> 00:18:11,548
[SPEAKER_01]: For FY24?

136
00:18:11,788 --> 00:18:13,748
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

137
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:21,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think what I would say is the scope of the structural, I mean, there's different ways of estimating that or calculating that, right?

138
00:18:23,072 --> 00:18:24,072
[SPEAKER_01]: The part of

139
00:18:25,148 --> 00:18:30,850
[SPEAKER_01]: The uncertainty behind our f y 23 budget are the open collective bargaining agreements now you've heard me say that.

140
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:49,195
[SPEAKER_01]: We have budgeted for 2% cost of living increase if those agreements settle above 2% and there's other there are additional reconciliations have done and it part of the sort of strategizing behind the patient is identifying where we potentially realize capacity necessary to do that at the same time.

141
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,396
[SPEAKER_01]: The challenge that we have

142
00:18:51,997 --> 00:19:00,166
[SPEAKER_01]: with respect to the scarcity of recurring funding and capacity, it's a recurring challenge.

143
00:19:00,687 --> 00:19:04,451
[SPEAKER_01]: And so whatever we can potentially solve in FY23,

144
00:19:06,277 --> 00:19:22,863
[SPEAKER_01]: I think partly to your point, we have to be anticipating what level of a challenge are we creating for ourselves in FY24, which is why the sustainability component of our bargaining strategy is as important as our competitiveness one.

145
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:30,725
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can't give you a sort of concrete number to say this is the number that we'll be facing in FY24.

146
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:41,474
[SPEAKER_01]: just like three weeks ago, I couldn't give you a concrete number as to what level of challenge we're facing in FY23, other than I can say that the themes are going to be the same.

147
00:19:42,255 --> 00:19:45,876
[SPEAKER_01]: That there's a limitation as to the revenue the city can raise.

148
00:19:47,037 --> 00:19:56,382
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a declining level of reliance that we can count on with respect to the one-time funding sources that were such a benefit to us in FY22.

149
00:19:57,883 --> 00:20:02,305
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are fixed costs that will escalate

150
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:23,567
[SPEAKER_01]: To what extent they escalate frankly depends on, in large part, where those collective bargaining agreements, ultimately settle, which is why it's a major driver of our budget and while any one of us could articulate, I think, in great detail, the extent to which we would like to

151
00:20:26,311 --> 00:20:36,037
[SPEAKER_01]: reward our employees for the tremendous work that they have done, particularly over the past couple of years, in helping guide students through this incredibly difficult chapter in the history of public education.

152
00:20:37,818 --> 00:20:48,224
[SPEAKER_01]: As true as that might be, the other variables that constrain our ability to compensate people, as we might morally like to, are there.

153
00:20:49,004 --> 00:20:53,247
[SPEAKER_01]: And we create more, I think, moral hazard

154
00:20:54,313 --> 00:20:58,096
[SPEAKER_01]: by making agreements that we know we can't sustain.

155
00:20:58,876 --> 00:21:16,089
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you've heard me say many times, and I know after six or seven of these meetings, it may sound repetitive, but when school districts establish or exacerbate structural deficits, it is inevitable that students with the greatest level of need will feel the brunt of it.

156
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,931
[SPEAKER_01]: There are positions that we cannot eliminate.

157
00:21:21,693 --> 00:21:23,634
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there are some that we should not eliminate.

158
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:32,140
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the conundrum that I think it is our responsibility, yours as the governing body, ours as the administration, that we don't walk ourselves into.

159
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:37,262
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have a number, but I did have a lengthy answer, and I hope that was helpful.

160
00:21:38,322 --> 00:21:42,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Looking at a different document, ESSER I is completely spent.

161
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,224
[SPEAKER_10]: ESSER II is completely spent.

162
00:21:44,545 --> 00:21:45,885
[SPEAKER_01]: ESSER II is not completely spent.

163
00:21:46,785 --> 00:21:46,865
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

164
00:21:46,945 --> 00:21:50,047
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ESSER II expiration is not until

165
00:21:52,162 --> 00:21:58,727
[SPEAKER_10]: The first quarter of FY 24 right I was looking at the budget book that showed the extra grants in the back.

166
00:21:58,947 --> 00:21:59,187
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

167
00:21:59,688 --> 00:22:11,837
[SPEAKER_10]: And Esther to was listed as completely spent for FY 22 and Esther three had like a couple hundred thousand left, which budget book is that when you sent the one from this year.

168
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:15,440
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have to go back and look at that but that that might be the.

169
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:28,682
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what that is is the total amount that we're anticipating spending, but we have $6.2 million over the course of the next two to three fiscal years that are at our disposal.

170
00:22:29,475 --> 00:22:33,498
[SPEAKER_10]: That does not include whatever you've just magically done to make this work, right?

171
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:34,859
[SPEAKER_10]: So that'll be a small number.

172
00:22:34,939 --> 00:22:35,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, it does.

173
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:38,561
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's $6.2 million going into this conversation.

174
00:22:39,341 --> 00:22:54,350
[SPEAKER_01]: But to be clear, there's, and again, I want to be very clear, especially for those who are just joining this budget process, this is a very complicated step-by-step process, and I don't mean to talk too quickly over any specific details.

175
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:56,692
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would ask the committee or members of the community to try to

176
00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:00,500
[SPEAKER_01]: if there are specific levels of detail that they would like to know, just ask.

177
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:08,401
[SPEAKER_01]: But with $6.2 million was the anticipated amount of remaining ESSER funds.

178
00:23:09,522 --> 00:23:14,303
[SPEAKER_01]: What we anticipated we would have at our disposal as of the beginning of fiscal year 23.

179
00:23:14,963 --> 00:23:20,724
[SPEAKER_01]: So last spring, we had said that we thought we would end up spending approximately, I think it was $1.8 or $1.9 million of ESSER money in FY22.

180
00:23:24,525 --> 00:23:37,314
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to come in below that in part because there were other external grants that came that were at our disposal during fiscal year 22, but only for fiscal year 22.

181
00:23:37,414 --> 00:23:43,599
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those were prioritized over the use of the ESSER grants in FY 22, because they can roll forward into FY 23.

182
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,681
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's about $6.2 million going into this conversation.

183
00:23:47,721 --> 00:23:49,763
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you know, under our category B priorities,

184
00:23:50,489 --> 00:23:55,632
[SPEAKER_01]: which amounted to $600,000 of urgent post-pandemic-related initiatives.

185
00:23:56,372 --> 00:24:03,656
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the amount that we were anticipating from the very beginning, assuming there was not operating budget capacity, would come out of that ESSER amount.

186
00:24:04,596 --> 00:24:17,863
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I can just add from the chair, Dave and I have worked, especially over the last six to nine months, to make sure that if something is ARPA qualified, that the city helps out on that end.

187
00:24:17,963 --> 00:24:18,763
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we've helped with

188
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:26,172
[SPEAKER_09]: some ADA signage, McGlynn playground design, 300,000 in testing.

189
00:24:26,232 --> 00:24:32,594
[SPEAKER_09]: We also put in water filtration systems handless into each of our schools for hundreds of thousand.

190
00:24:32,954 --> 00:24:38,937
[SPEAKER_09]: And we covered that all in the city ARPA side so that we could make sure that ESSER remains as stable as possible.

191
00:24:39,257 --> 00:24:40,237
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mayor.

192
00:24:40,317 --> 00:24:40,897
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a good point.

193
00:24:40,917 --> 00:24:47,140
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's part of why we enjoy the important partnership and continuous dialogue with the mayor's office because

194
00:24:48,732 --> 00:25:06,567
[SPEAKER_01]: the mayor's exactly correct that while we want to be strategic and capitalize on the ESSER funding while it's available, given that we have something of a runway or shelf life to utilize it, where there are other funding sources we've relied on.

195
00:25:06,727 --> 00:25:15,053
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and certainly the COVID testing platform that we established with Tufts University was a sizable amount of money, frankly,

196
00:25:15,816 --> 00:25:31,125
[SPEAKER_01]: The grants did defray the sort of $2 million down to closer to $1 million as to what we spent in FY22, but we were anticipating hundreds of thousands of testing dollars that ultimately we were able to save on due to the city's ARPA capacity.

197
00:25:32,006 --> 00:25:32,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

198
00:25:35,788 --> 00:25:36,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor?

199
00:25:36,929 --> 00:25:37,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham?

200
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:43,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Is the city going to publish an accounting of how ARPA money has been spent and what is being attributed to schools?

201
00:25:44,425 --> 00:25:45,165
[SPEAKER_05]: I've not seen that.

202
00:25:45,405 --> 00:25:46,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, we will be.

203
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:46,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

204
00:25:47,026 --> 00:25:56,867
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that would be important because I think it's great that we are capitalizing on our use of ARPA and ESSER and all the grant funding that goes away.

205
00:25:56,887 --> 00:25:58,928
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's great.

206
00:25:58,968 --> 00:26:02,008
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think the community fully understands how the money is being spent.

207
00:26:02,108 --> 00:26:10,850
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that is critically important, but I guess I'm also, as I read the budget book, it looks like we're

208
00:26:11,308 --> 00:26:15,093
[SPEAKER_05]: pretty darn close to exhausting ESSER at the end of FY23.

209
00:26:15,434 --> 00:26:21,322
[SPEAKER_05]: So the Great Retrain is sort of effectively over and we won't have that to fall back on next year.

210
00:26:21,342 --> 00:26:25,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that reasonably close?

211
00:26:27,045 --> 00:26:32,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't we fast forward, Dr. Bishop, to the slide FY ESSER funding priorities.

212
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:43,704
[SPEAKER_01]: So this slide details the buckets of funding that the district is anticipating we will use ESSER funding for.

213
00:26:44,445 --> 00:26:44,905
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's

214
00:26:47,563 --> 00:26:49,684
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty clear in terms of what those buckets are.

215
00:26:49,704 --> 00:26:53,905
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't anticipate that they will be exhausted at the end of FY23.

216
00:26:53,925 --> 00:26:56,806
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I don't anticipate that at all.

217
00:26:57,666 --> 00:27:02,408
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there are some variables that are as yet undetermined.

218
00:27:02,588 --> 00:27:07,610
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's impossible at this stage to say exactly what our estimated S or usage would be.

219
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:08,250
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that

220
00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:18,252
[SPEAKER_01]: to miss Graham's point, I do think the community, um, could benefit, uh, from, uh, uh, articulation of those, uh, Essar funding priorities.

221
00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:23,834
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Christian, we just do the Essar funding priorities slide.

222
00:27:23,874 --> 00:27:25,254
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be, uh, that's okay.

223
00:27:25,274 --> 00:27:26,274
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's the next one.

224
00:27:26,574 --> 00:27:26,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

225
00:27:27,275 --> 00:27:31,796
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you can see here that there are, there are, uh, four,

226
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:34,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Just let me finish my first point, then I'll get to my second.

227
00:27:35,008 --> 00:27:35,268
[SPEAKER_01]: To Ms.

228
00:27:35,288 --> 00:27:47,978
[SPEAKER_01]: Graham's question about articulating clearly for the community everything that the various funding sources and investments that the school district is benefiting from, I think that's necessary.

229
00:27:48,698 --> 00:28:00,767
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the challenges is that as the federal guidance and regulations have shifted over the course of the last two years, there have been moments where things that we did not think were eligible for funding became eligible for funding.

230
00:28:00,927 --> 00:28:01,267
[SPEAKER_01]: And so,

231
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:08,885
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to update that in real time, even for those of us in the finance office, has been a challenge.

232
00:28:10,265 --> 00:28:16,029
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not blaming the federal government and our benefactors in Washington.

233
00:28:16,089 --> 00:28:19,391
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that I recognize they've never done this either.

234
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:23,133
[SPEAKER_01]: But trying to keep track of exactly

235
00:28:24,294 --> 00:28:34,460
[SPEAKER_01]: what sort of out of nowhere significant funding source we're using to cover which expenses can feel like a bit like a roller coaster at times.

236
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,221
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we should do that.

237
00:28:36,902 --> 00:28:45,267
[SPEAKER_01]: But it might be one of those things where people don't we there has to be sort of a delay in the messaging before we sort of identify exactly what account that came from.

238
00:28:45,387 --> 00:28:46,848
[SPEAKER_01]: But so but thank you for that question.

239
00:28:47,689 --> 00:28:51,054
[SPEAKER_01]: With regard to the FY23 funding priorities, it's essentially in four buckets.

240
00:28:52,396 --> 00:28:56,241
[SPEAKER_01]: The first are unrealized, sort of what we're talking about tonight.

241
00:28:56,702 --> 00:29:04,072
[SPEAKER_01]: There are pieces of the $4 million delta between the anticipated appropriations

242
00:29:04,662 --> 00:29:21,707
[SPEAKER_01]: and the school committee's request that will be charged to us, some of them like the $600,000 that would position us to open a new newcomer strand for our English learner students, staff, increase our adjustment Councilor staff, as well as our nursing staff.

243
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:24,968
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are priorities that from the very beginning of the budgeting process,

244
00:29:25,501 --> 00:29:37,830
[SPEAKER_01]: In anticipation of some degree of a delta, we knew that those would be appropriate based on their nexus between the need for these priorities and the pandemic.

245
00:29:38,662 --> 00:29:49,087
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as from a numbers perspective, in the range of what we were looking to invest from our funding sources in FY23.

246
00:29:50,368 --> 00:29:57,652
[SPEAKER_01]: There are others that are a continuation of some of the programming that we have, or initiatives we've instituted in FY22.

247
00:29:57,852 --> 00:30:05,676
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not to say that each of these would be identical to what we did in FY22, or even that the financial impact might be identical.

248
00:30:06,482 --> 00:30:16,723
[SPEAKER_01]: But things like the Acceleration Academies or after school support, potentially SEL programming like Camp Mustang, our engagement team to increase our family and community engagement.

249
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:32,632
[SPEAKER_01]: programming as well as to some degree, and I certainly think this will be less, I hope it will be less in FY23 and even less still in FY24, but some degree of COVID mitigation and public health measures along the lines of ventilation and testing.

250
00:30:33,352 --> 00:30:45,695
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition, there's professional learning, much of which was supported by ESSER funds in FY22, and some are things that, due to this particular shortfall,

251
00:30:47,748 --> 00:31:02,120
[SPEAKER_01]: we would potentially move on onto the ESSER funding, understanding that we are trying to, we said last year, the goal was essentially 35%, 35%, 30% over the three years that we had access to this funding.

252
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:08,845
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna come in a little lower than 35%, maybe significantly lower than 35% in FY22.

253
00:31:09,386 --> 00:31:12,448
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the hope would be to then have greater flexibility and capacity in FY23 and FY24.

254
00:31:17,435 --> 00:31:27,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Final bucket, and again, these pieces here that are still uncertain in part because of ongoing negotiations, but until some of those variables

255
00:31:29,252 --> 00:31:31,635
[SPEAKER_01]: are more, are sort of firmed up.

256
00:31:32,495 --> 00:31:41,224
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to articulate in as much detail as we can sort of looking back on FY22 exactly how that funding will be utilized.

257
00:31:41,304 --> 00:31:51,895
[SPEAKER_01]: But certainly from a thematic perspective, you can see that one, we're only going to use ESSER funding for things that are ESSER eligible, a point that

258
00:31:53,177 --> 00:32:07,089
[SPEAKER_01]: I will just candidly say, I didn't think I would have to reiterate as many times as I have in recent weeks, but I'll continue to say it, that if a expenditure is not eligible for this funding, then we are not going to use the funding for that expenditure.

259
00:32:10,031 --> 00:32:11,072
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not really an opinion.

260
00:32:11,112 --> 00:32:15,796
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just, that's, that's something that we're going to have to do or not to, as the case may be.

261
00:32:16,857 --> 00:32:23,943
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think, again, as we get greater clarity, this is a piece that we'll be reporting back to the committee on over the course of the fiscal year.

262
00:32:26,464 --> 00:32:27,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Member McLaughlin.

263
00:32:28,506 --> 00:32:30,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you elaborate on 3C?

264
00:32:31,528 --> 00:32:31,888
[SPEAKER_06]: 3C.

265
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:34,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you go back to that slide, Mr. Dr. Fishman?

266
00:32:34,971 --> 00:32:35,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Engagement team?

267
00:32:36,132 --> 00:32:36,332
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

268
00:32:36,372 --> 00:32:38,273
[SPEAKER_06]: So professional support for high need.

269
00:32:38,573 --> 00:32:38,754
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

270
00:32:40,113 --> 00:33:02,504
[SPEAKER_01]: What I can tell you is that the rationale and the strategy that we've used since we first had access to this level of funding was that we recognize that for most vulnerable student populations, the effects of the pandemic and the disruptions to learning that took place and that to some extent continue to take place are disproportionate.

271
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:25,989
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by trying to look at the expenditure of ESSER through an equity lens, just as we do the expenditure of all funds, it's the case that if there are staffing positions that, supplemental staffing type positions that we need to invest in, in order to make sure that learning gaps that are either caused or exacerbated by the pandemic are narrowed,

272
00:33:26,469 --> 00:33:33,580
[SPEAKER_01]: then that would be something that we would tend to look to the ESSER capacity to see if it's something that we can cover.

273
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:36,845
[SPEAKER_01]: So, honestly, you know, this is covered in

274
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:59,544
[SPEAKER_01]: the first bucket as it happens, but the establishment of an additional newcomer strand in staffing positions, that is an example of something that we are doing because we recognize that some of the class sizes in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic are unsustainable, even with additional staffing supports.

275
00:33:59,584 --> 00:34:05,245
[SPEAKER_01]: And so while personnel positions are typically not something that we want to

276
00:34:05,945 --> 00:34:25,786
[SPEAKER_01]: be reliant on grant funding for, in this case, the immediacy of the need and how pronounced the need is, require us to essentially suspend our principles with regard to one-time funding sources for staff and invest in those positions.

277
00:34:25,826 --> 00:34:27,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it's also true that

278
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:35,140
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our hope that some of that need will be diminished over time, and therefore it is more consistent with how we would like to use one-time funding.

279
00:34:36,201 --> 00:34:46,488
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's essentially just what that means, that that's what would be prioritized over, say, additional positions to expand electives at the high school.

280
00:34:46,568 --> 00:34:47,669
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great thing to do.

281
00:34:47,709 --> 00:34:55,775
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to expand electives at the high school, but expanding electives and having a diverse course catalog at the high school would be a goal

282
00:34:56,576 --> 00:34:58,656
[SPEAKER_01]: with or without the pandemic, without those disruptions.

283
00:34:59,477 --> 00:35:04,998
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that would be something that we'd be more typically, we would more typically be inclined to use operating funds for, as opposed to ESSER.

284
00:35:07,078 --> 00:35:07,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

285
00:35:10,939 --> 00:35:11,819
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have a quick question.

286
00:35:11,899 --> 00:35:12,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, member Kreatz.

287
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

288
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:23,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you be able to just give some examples of the one-time funding sources, what that would be like, and the revolving funding sources, just in case the public doesn't know?

289
00:35:23,462 --> 00:35:23,722
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

290
00:35:23,762 --> 00:35:24,122
[SPEAKER_01]: No, thank you.

291
00:35:24,824 --> 00:35:25,066
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

292
00:35:25,106 --> 00:35:26,777
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. That's a good question.

293
00:35:26,797 --> 00:35:26,898
[SPEAKER_01]: So

294
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:55,350
[SPEAKER_01]: And just for context purposes, the reason that this is important is that when we have a $4 million discrepancy between the request and the appropriation, there are things in the package that the school committee approved that we want to do, that there are positions that we want to have, there are offices that we want to keep intact, there are initiatives that we want to make sure that we are affording students the opportunity to engage in.

295
00:35:56,713 --> 00:36:22,497
[SPEAKER_01]: If the operating budget capacity isn't there, but there is an appropriate funding source, and generally speaking, the propriety of a funding source would depend on how closely associated the revenue source is with whatever the initiative is that we're trying to do, or positions that we're trying to staff, then we would look to see what funding sources are available.

296
00:36:23,445 --> 00:36:35,768
[SPEAKER_01]: So that could be any of our 13 or 14 revolving funds, I mean, an example would be, we have revolving funds that help support our career and technical education programming in our vocational section of the high school.

297
00:36:36,346 --> 00:36:42,950
[SPEAKER_01]: And the revolving funds are revenue, generally speaking, generated by the tuitions that students are paying to come and attend our program.

298
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:48,853
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there are positions that we would greatly prefer to be on the operating budget.

299
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:54,837
[SPEAKER_01]: It is something that we will have to examine closely over the coming years in the hope of migrating those positions to the operating budget.

300
00:36:55,157 --> 00:37:00,940
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't want to cost students the opportunity to enroll in the Chapter 74 program of their choice.

301
00:37:01,421 --> 00:37:05,383
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in that case, we would rely on, for instance, the CTE revolving fund

302
00:37:05,843 --> 00:37:08,024
[SPEAKER_01]: in order to staff those positions.

303
00:37:08,385 --> 00:37:31,637
[SPEAKER_01]: And there could be similar situations with the athletics or community schools revolving funds, with before and after school programming revolving funds, or with the food service revolving funds, where, and frankly, up until two years ago, I think there was more of a practice in the Medford public schools of relying on the revolving funds to fund certain positions.

304
00:37:32,338 --> 00:37:33,418
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a practice that,

305
00:37:35,729 --> 00:37:44,294
[SPEAKER_01]: our administration has tried to move away from for purposes of stability and just predictability.

306
00:37:45,395 --> 00:38:03,566
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this case, I think it's more advantageous to be creative with how positions are funded than to try to reorganize to a disproportionate extent on a very short timeline.

307
00:38:04,398 --> 00:38:08,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, and I, this is in here somewhere and I guess we'll get, we'll get to it.

308
00:38:08,721 --> 00:38:34,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, one of the, one of the opportunities that I think we should look at FY 23 as, as representing, uh, maybe not an opportunity that some, you know, that we're all desperate to necessarily, uh, seize upon, but a, an opportunity is to look really closely at everything that we're funding through some of these one time funding sources and what we're funding on the operating side.

309
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,924
[SPEAKER_01]: and to try to be really strategic and thoughtful about what expenses belong where.

310
00:38:39,424 --> 00:38:51,154
[SPEAKER_01]: It might well be the case that we have revolving funds that are very steady and that there's going to be a revenue source there, unless there's a pandemic or something, that we can rely on.

311
00:38:51,234 --> 00:38:59,281
[SPEAKER_01]: In which case, it may be worth continuing that practice so as to not eat up operating funds.

312
00:38:59,422 --> 00:39:01,944
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no benefit to having massive surpluses

313
00:39:02,887 --> 00:39:06,250
[SPEAKER_01]: are revolving funds, and in some cases we're prohibited from having massive surpluses.

314
00:39:07,871 --> 00:39:21,763
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's a very different scenario to examine these things over the course of the next year as opposed to examining them over a very short period of time to balance a budget.

315
00:39:21,803 --> 00:39:25,266
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's one of the things that we can look forward to in FY23.

316
00:39:28,394 --> 00:39:32,575
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm more than happy to take other questions of the great marriage is given that it's a public area.

317
00:39:32,775 --> 00:39:35,316
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to pause for second see if there are folks either.

318
00:39:36,696 --> 00:39:37,956
[SPEAKER_01]: You're online.

319
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:41,057
[SPEAKER_01]: That have questions.

320
00:39:42,858 --> 00:39:46,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Was the number from the chair was the number of asset funds used 1.2 million.

321
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:51,280
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to be about 1.2 million.

322
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:56,541
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly don't have an exact number right now but that's the last time we did a projection that we were just getting.

323
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:03,574
[SPEAKER_09]: And then our temporary positions, I know, will end in two and a half years, December 31st, 2024.

324
00:40:03,835 --> 00:40:06,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that the same with SRD now?

325
00:40:07,957 --> 00:40:09,979
[SPEAKER_01]: When do the funds sunset?

326
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:12,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Or when do they have to be expended by?

327
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:14,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Expended by six months after that, but you have to...

328
00:40:15,029 --> 00:40:17,490
[SPEAKER_09]: can only have people in positions till December 31st, 2024.

329
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:20,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, unless they're migrated to operating positions.

330
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:20,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.

331
00:40:21,271 --> 00:40:38,016
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are two, technically, ESSER I expires September 1st or 30th, I'd have to, probably 30th to make more sense, of this year, ESSER I. September 30, 2022.

332
00:40:38,917 --> 00:40:40,437
[SPEAKER_01]: September 30, yeah.

333
00:40:40,517 --> 00:40:42,078
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they extended it, did you say 2021?

334
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:48,068
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I'm just looking at the memo we got a couple days ago.

335
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:52,277
[SPEAKER_10]: ESSER 1 obligation deadlines, September 30, 2022.

336
00:40:53,898 --> 00:40:56,099
[SPEAKER_10]: 22, yeah, right, exactly.

337
00:40:56,239 --> 00:41:00,180
[SPEAKER_10]: And 2023 for ESSER II and 2024 for ESSER III, same date, September 30th.

338
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's the first quarter of the fiscal year that it ends.

339
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:07,981
[SPEAKER_01]: So our ESSER I, which is essentially depleted anyway, is September 30th, 2022.

340
00:41:08,362 --> 00:41:18,624
[SPEAKER_01]: And our ESSER II, again, it's $6.2 million, but the vast majority of the eligible expenses are the same.

341
00:41:18,664 --> 00:41:22,425
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I honestly, I don't recall the distinction between ESSER II and ESSER III.

342
00:41:22,865 --> 00:41:27,507
[SPEAKER_01]: The distinction between the two programs is more about reporting requirements than eligibility of expenses.

343
00:41:27,567 --> 00:41:37,170
[SPEAKER_01]: And so ESSER II is the first quarter of fiscal year 24, calendar, so as Mr. Rousseau said, September 30th, 2023.

344
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:43,091
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 is the end of ESSER III.

345
00:41:43,712 --> 00:41:47,893
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can basically rely on these fundings for the next two school years.

346
00:41:48,933 --> 00:41:50,814
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the easiest way to explain it.

347
00:41:52,483 --> 00:41:52,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

348
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau?

349
00:41:56,713 --> 00:41:57,054
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

350
00:41:57,334 --> 00:42:02,346
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't see any hands up on Zoom, so I'll just ask my quick question here.

351
00:42:04,417 --> 00:42:10,619
[SPEAKER_10]: When we report, you were listing reasons to not have people on revolving accounts and stuff.

352
00:42:10,839 --> 00:42:13,939
[SPEAKER_10]: You didn't include transparency, which I think is a very important part of it.

353
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,620
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't trying to hide it, though.

354
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,980
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I know.

355
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:28,423
[SPEAKER_10]: But when we report to the state, the state lists some very fascinating data about what school districts are spending, which is, for the most part, absolute garbage.

356
00:42:29,105 --> 00:42:43,732
[SPEAKER_10]: know, Somerville allegedly spends far less per student than us, but their buildings, their custodial, their food service workers, all of their entire IT infrastructure and staff and more utilities is all in the city side.

357
00:42:43,992 --> 00:42:49,155
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, it makes it look like they have a pretty healthy budget.

358
00:42:50,265 --> 00:42:54,406
[SPEAKER_10]: and then you divide it by the number of students, then it looks like things are really much worse over there.

359
00:42:54,887 --> 00:42:57,087
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's just not fair and not accurate.

360
00:42:57,807 --> 00:43:10,251
[SPEAKER_10]: My question, though, is when we put people off of the operating and put them onto revolving accounts and also grants, are they included in the numbers that we tell the state anymore?

361
00:43:10,311 --> 00:43:11,672
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we telling them the budget?

362
00:43:13,012 --> 00:43:13,933
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

363
00:43:14,213 --> 00:43:14,953
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.

364
00:43:15,433 --> 00:43:17,274
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly want to check on that.

365
00:43:18,467 --> 00:43:20,848
[SPEAKER_01]: We report in a few different ways.

366
00:43:21,449 --> 00:43:26,032
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that the data you're referring to I'm assuming is from the dusty dashboard.

367
00:43:26,112 --> 00:43:31,055
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, in which it says this district is paying this much on administration is paying this much on teachers.

368
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:34,797
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's usually broken down into general education special education.

369
00:43:35,253 --> 00:43:37,315
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a few other subcategories.

370
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:48,403
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, I would be surprised if the use of certainly revolving funds had an impact on our reporting.

371
00:43:49,043 --> 00:44:01,112
[SPEAKER_01]: And I honestly, I think that's true for the external funds as well, because for instance, our Title I, our teachers who were focused on Title I reading, those are gonna be reported in our numbers as well.

372
00:44:02,637 --> 00:44:06,301
[SPEAKER_01]: Essar has only been around for a couple of years, so I don't frankly know.

373
00:44:06,321 --> 00:44:11,086
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't think of a reason why that would be distinguished but I can look into that and get back to you.

374
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:17,192
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, more details, because I agree I mean you want to you want the reporting to paint a complete picture.

375
00:44:17,762 --> 00:44:29,876
[SPEAKER_01]: And to your point about Somerville, and this happens all the time on the personnel side, where districts will survey other districts about, well, how much does the person in this position earn?

376
00:44:30,617 --> 00:44:35,343
[SPEAKER_01]: And the position, the title might be the same, but the portfolio is completely different.

377
00:44:35,891 --> 00:44:51,283
[SPEAKER_01]: and therefore that in in there's a variety of other variables that you have to factor in and you really frankly need real familiarity with their work structure to understand the comparable and person is and I think the point that you make but that this sort of the division of the budget is is very so.

378
00:44:56,147 --> 00:44:56,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham.

379
00:44:58,777 --> 00:45:16,274
[SPEAKER_05]: As we go into next year, can we have a quarterly accounting of ESSER funds spent and like planned, essentially, so understanding that it's, it is going to change, you know, over time and it should because we want to make sure we're maximizing use the money but it's

380
00:45:16,772 --> 00:45:24,834
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not my sense that we're gonna be looking for ways to spend money at the end of the line here, given all that we're having to use it for in this next year.

381
00:45:25,254 --> 00:45:26,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I think that's right.

382
00:45:26,414 --> 00:45:45,778
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it will be, and we've tried to provide budget quarterly updates, but I think a focus on ESSER and frankly, all external funds next year will be important because the issue of how this sort of trajectory is going with respect to

383
00:45:46,587 --> 00:46:03,931
[SPEAKER_01]: the city's capacity versus the school's needs, is that, as I said, there are going to have to be decisions made with regard to what do we migrate, what do we cease funding, and what are needs that we don't realize we have now that we'll need in the future.

384
00:46:04,331 --> 00:46:06,571
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the only way to do that will be with greater scrutiny.

385
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:09,832
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, I think my short answer to that is yes, I think we should do that.

386
00:46:12,233 --> 00:46:13,633
[SPEAKER_01]: Just about the process again,

387
00:46:14,707 --> 00:46:35,657
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of why I think the exercise that we've engaged in is important is that it is a good way of helping to convey to the community at large, not just what the immediate needs are now with respect to what's going to prevent the district from imploding, but what is going to ultimately be the investments that move the district forward.

388
00:46:36,178 --> 00:46:38,939
[SPEAKER_01]: And last year, as you recall, the Delta was smaller.

389
00:46:39,465 --> 00:46:45,070
[SPEAKER_01]: But the priorities that we listed that we didn't fund in FY22, the ones that come to mind most easily, were the math coaches.

390
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:48,332
[SPEAKER_01]: And we said it's not that we don't need math coaches, we need math coaches.

391
00:46:48,793 --> 00:46:58,521
[SPEAKER_01]: We just think that based on the totality of the needs, that we'll be more ripe for math coaches, we'll be more ripe for consideration in the succeeding fiscal year.

392
00:46:58,861 --> 00:47:07,068
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, as you probably remember, they were category A and they were the first bullet point because we know that we've made the investment that we need to in the math curriculum

393
00:47:07,423 --> 00:47:11,707
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now we need to make sure that we have the associated staffing to to make the most of that investment.

394
00:47:12,968 --> 00:47:14,429
[SPEAKER_01]: So what will it be next year?

395
00:47:14,449 --> 00:47:17,172
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, frankly, it might be that

396
00:47:17,577 --> 00:47:42,638
[SPEAKER_01]: we decide that the adjustment Councilors that we think are an emergency need right now, and therefore we're gonna resort to the ESSER funding, we're gonna determine that we're seeing SEL advancement and a stronger school culture and other more micro points of data that will tell us that this is something that before we do anything else with the operating budget, we need to absorb this into the operating budget to make sure that that's a stabilized position.

397
00:47:42,698 --> 00:47:43,078
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

398
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:44,639
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that's the case.

399
00:47:44,679 --> 00:47:45,360
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, frankly, I hope,

400
00:47:48,062 --> 00:47:59,253
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the FY 24 priorities will be, but my hope is that we're able to construct a continuous narrative that can help the community to understand exactly how the organization functions and how it can function better.

401
00:48:00,895 --> 00:48:07,021
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do want to say that the feedback that I've heard from the community is that they appreciate that.

402
00:48:08,217 --> 00:48:22,300
[SPEAKER_05]: We are having this discussion in a proactive manner on the school committee that we've moved away from past practice, which was dysfunctional and didn't give the community an understanding of what the district felt like it authentically needed.

403
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:25,521
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that the feedback on that has been good.

404
00:48:25,601 --> 00:48:33,423
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the negative feedback has been about the surprise of how big of a gap we are trying to fill in the month of June.

405
00:48:34,379 --> 00:48:37,621
[SPEAKER_05]: to get to a budget that you all can operate against on July 1st.

406
00:48:37,801 --> 00:48:44,704
[SPEAKER_05]: So that has been exceedingly surprising to everybody, including I think most of the people in this room.

407
00:48:45,805 --> 00:48:49,366
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am really concerned that we cannot do that again next year.

408
00:48:49,447 --> 00:48:58,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we're, we're sort of out of options to move stuff around at the very last minute without impacting kids.

409
00:48:58,811 --> 00:49:00,472
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can't do this again.

410
00:49:00,492 --> 00:49:02,573
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think the community

411
00:49:04,049 --> 00:49:04,849
[SPEAKER_07]: we'll stand for it again.

412
00:49:11,411 --> 00:49:11,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau?

413
00:49:12,391 --> 00:49:15,432
[SPEAKER_07]: We do have a name, a name, a hand up.

414
00:49:16,893 --> 00:49:17,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Dave McKenna?

415
00:49:25,695 --> 00:49:27,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, sorry, just took a minute to unmute.

416
00:49:29,972 --> 00:49:42,422
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess my comment is for the mayor given that we are facing long-term challenges just in maintaining the current funding of our schools with expiring one-time funds.

417
00:49:43,463 --> 00:49:51,229
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to ask you to begin the prop two and a half override process so that we can not balance the budget

418
00:49:52,162 --> 00:49:55,444
[SPEAKER_00]: on the backs of our teachers with a 2% raise.

419
00:49:55,665 --> 00:49:59,227
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's for all that they've done for us in the past couple of years.

420
00:49:59,267 --> 00:50:06,232
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's an insult to say that balancing our budget requires giving such a terrible raise.

421
00:50:06,932 --> 00:50:12,156
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can't even afford to do that in a couple of years unless we increase our operating budget.

422
00:50:12,216 --> 00:50:19,541
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I think it's pretty clear that we need to do a prop two and a half override.

423
00:50:21,109 --> 00:50:23,411
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ask you to begin that process.

424
00:50:26,994 --> 00:50:28,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Dave.

425
00:50:29,716 --> 00:50:42,306
[SPEAKER_09]: One issue we would face if we didn't override, of course, I would never have even thought to do it during the global pandemic, especially 2020-2021 when we were facing budget issues at that point.

426
00:50:43,446 --> 00:50:47,870
[SPEAKER_09]: And now we have people struggling, we have inflation, we have a recession coming.

427
00:50:50,253 --> 00:50:55,558
[SPEAKER_09]: To do that now would also be, if we ever did that, it would be included in our revenue number.

428
00:50:55,578 --> 00:51:01,684
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we did in the past, same thing would almost be included as if it was the large donation that we took in.

429
00:51:01,784 --> 00:51:07,689
[SPEAKER_09]: So revenues would be affected and allow us to use less of our opera funding to help supplement the budget.

430
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:15,176
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's the school committee's goal to hopefully fund a new high school.

431
00:51:16,105 --> 00:51:26,332
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's going to take something as far as a debt exclusion or a proposition two and a half override, even if we get half the funding from the MSBA.

432
00:51:26,992 --> 00:51:39,641
[SPEAKER_09]: So for a community to fund at such difficult times, something like that in a couple of years and an override is probably just to take care of the budget.

433
00:51:40,336 --> 00:51:47,401
[SPEAKER_09]: is probably not something I think the community would support, and it would be hard-pressed to put it forward during a global pandemic or in a recession.

434
00:51:50,944 --> 00:51:51,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor.

435
00:51:53,386 --> 00:51:53,886
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau.

436
00:51:54,327 --> 00:51:54,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

437
00:51:55,347 --> 00:52:01,672
[SPEAKER_10]: I fully respect what you just said, and I definitely agree that certainly plenty of people are hurting.

438
00:52:02,513 --> 00:52:08,457
[SPEAKER_10]: I will say Medford is one of four communities that has never done a debt exclusion or an override, and so

439
00:52:10,507 --> 00:52:27,150
[SPEAKER_10]: My only real response to that is, I know you're from Medford and I'm not, but I don't think any of us know what the residents of Medford would say to an override.

440
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:29,451
[SPEAKER_10]: That's called democracy by letting them vote.

441
00:52:29,991 --> 00:52:32,731
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not democracy by not letting them vote and choose.

442
00:52:33,271 --> 00:52:37,032
[SPEAKER_10]: If the voters say no, the voters have said no.

443
00:52:37,895 --> 00:52:39,616
[SPEAKER_10]: but we don't know what the voters would say.

444
00:52:40,116 --> 00:52:47,939
[SPEAKER_10]: And so, you know, everybody gets a vote except nobody gets a vote because we won't let them choose.

445
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:54,142
[SPEAKER_10]: So I certainly understand that people are hurting and this is not, you know, I mean, are we entering a recession soon?

446
00:52:55,002 --> 00:53:05,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Things don't look good, but how we respond to this fiscal situation

447
00:53:07,193 --> 00:53:07,633
[SPEAKER_10]: matters.

448
00:53:07,793 --> 00:53:14,078
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if the next budget is, all right, we've got to find 20, 50 teachers or staff to get rid of.

449
00:53:14,238 --> 00:53:18,201
[SPEAKER_10]: As we've already discussed, it's definitely not going to be the principal teaching staff.

450
00:53:18,421 --> 00:53:26,726
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be the paras, the nurses, the adjustment Councilors, all of the people that are helping kids that are in crisis.

451
00:53:27,187 --> 00:53:34,392
[SPEAKER_10]: The regular teachers, of course, are doing that too, but they're not getting laid off because somebody has to stand in front of the classroom.

452
00:53:35,434 --> 00:53:39,118
[SPEAKER_10]: And then a year after that, if it's really a recession, it's not going to be six months.

453
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:48,346
[SPEAKER_10]: What are we going to then get rid of electives and throw kids into gigantic rooms to quote study halls or whatever they're called nowadays?

454
00:53:48,506 --> 00:53:57,614
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, this situation, if the residents want to remedy it, we should let them remedy it.

455
00:53:58,097 --> 00:54:08,303
[SPEAKER_10]: but we aren't letting them, and by we, I mean you and then perhaps the city council, I have to admit, I'm a little confused on the process still, aren't letting them decide.

456
00:54:09,644 --> 00:54:12,746
[SPEAKER_10]: And to me, that doesn't feel like respecting the residents.

457
00:54:14,046 --> 00:54:14,347
Thank you.

458
00:54:16,228 --> 00:54:19,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, I'm not letting the voters decide.

459
00:54:19,269 --> 00:54:24,813
[SPEAKER_09]: The first I've heard was last week that I should have done an override to supplement the budget.

460
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:31,062
[SPEAKER_09]: All other talks or requests for me over the last two years have been, we need a new high school.

461
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:32,442
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to prepare for that.

462
00:54:32,462 --> 00:54:38,604
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to create a campaign to get community support, to hopefully be able to fund a new high school.

463
00:54:38,764 --> 00:54:49,067
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've also heard, you know, our roads, that is definitely something that will be explored, but to fund a budget, I think we need to live within our means.

464
00:54:49,247 --> 00:54:53,989
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we need to wean off of one-time funds, which we always knew we had to do.

465
00:54:54,574 --> 00:54:57,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Last fiscal year, we could use 12.3 million.

466
00:54:57,716 --> 00:55:14,268
[SPEAKER_09]: This year, we're sticking to our number, but for that donation, which will be about $7.6 million from free cash, which we thankfully budgeted well, and we're able to build that up to cover us this year and hopefully next year.

467
00:55:14,288 --> 00:55:24,035
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the same time, we have an economic development director who is actively working with my office to bring in new development from life science to mixed use

468
00:55:24,448 --> 00:55:26,930
[SPEAKER_09]: to housing we are negotiating 340 bees.

469
00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:35,637
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm negotiating three community host agreements with marijuana companies, we are doing everything we can to be able to sustain this city budget.

470
00:55:36,157 --> 00:55:48,246
[SPEAKER_09]: When it comes time, those buildings yes they won't be built for two three years, but we're doing the work to build that commercial tax base, because it was going down two years ago and all we want to do is build that up.

471
00:55:49,901 --> 00:56:00,308
[SPEAKER_09]: I can go on, but that's where I stand, and anybody can take the initiative to ask the public for multiple overrides for multiple things, but we have to be realistic at the same time.

472
00:56:03,171 --> 00:56:03,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ruseau.

473
00:56:03,972 --> 00:56:04,592
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a rebuttal.

474
00:56:05,633 --> 00:56:11,397
[SPEAKER_10]: I would just say, though, that Medford, as far as I can tell, has the lowest public school enrollment in the entire state at 72%.

475
00:56:11,717 --> 00:56:22,505
[SPEAKER_10]: And when people are deciding whether they want to send their kids to our schools, listening to the conversation we just had would definitely be a big decider for me to say, maybe not.

476
00:56:24,127 --> 00:56:26,989
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, we are definitely not committing to

477
00:56:28,499 --> 00:56:31,622
[SPEAKER_10]: making them better if we're just going to be like, we've got to live within our means.

478
00:56:31,882 --> 00:56:40,750
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, people are buying million dollar plus homes and getting here and getting the same level of service they get from the little podunk town in New Hampshire where I grew up.

479
00:56:42,511 --> 00:56:45,314
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's what they get for their million dollar plus homes.

480
00:56:45,334 --> 00:56:50,899
[SPEAKER_10]: They get a tax rate, not a tax rate, a tax bill that shocks many of them, shocks them.

481
00:56:51,239 --> 00:56:51,940
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this right?

482
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:54,282
[SPEAKER_10]: How can this be all I have to pay in taxes?

483
00:56:55,781 --> 00:57:07,549
[SPEAKER_10]: And while I understand plenty of people get their tax bill and have a very different response because they didn't buy a million dollar house, they bought a house in Medford 30, 40, 50 years ago and the tax bill is hard to swallow.

484
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:19,478
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think we're gonna have this sort of clash where we have residents moving in here paying top dollar for homes that, I mean, every single day on Facebook, it's another post for a home for sale.

485
00:57:19,958 --> 00:57:22,300
[SPEAKER_10]: And you look at it and it's frequently like,

486
00:57:23,755 --> 00:57:26,076
[SPEAKER_10]: know, a two or three bedroom capable one bathroom.

487
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:31,457
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's cost two plus times as much as my condo from 15 years ago.

488
00:57:31,878 --> 00:57:46,002
[SPEAKER_10]: But they're moving here, paying $1 million for that, and then getting services that frankly, you can go to other Facebook groups, since we don't have media anymore, you can go to other Facebook groups and see, like, wait, when's this?

489
00:57:46,202 --> 00:57:47,162
[SPEAKER_10]: When's this service?

490
00:57:47,222 --> 00:57:48,083
[SPEAKER_10]: When's that service?

491
00:57:48,143 --> 00:57:50,623
[SPEAKER_10]: The answer is, it doesn't exist, or you can't have it.

492
00:57:52,504 --> 00:57:52,744
[SPEAKER_10]: So I

493
00:57:54,636 --> 00:58:02,543
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, this really low percentage of public school enrollment has been an issue for me for years now, once I was able to finally find it on the state's website.

494
00:58:03,263 --> 00:58:09,289
[SPEAKER_10]: And I understand we had a lot of people going to Catholic schools and that had nothing to do with the quality of our schools.

495
00:58:09,769 --> 00:58:17,235
[SPEAKER_10]: But as other communities also had lots of kids going to Catholic schools, and they're not now.

496
00:58:17,556 --> 00:58:18,877
[SPEAKER_10]: 72% is frankly embarrassing.

497
00:58:19,077 --> 00:58:19,858
[SPEAKER_10]: It says something.

498
00:58:19,878 --> 00:58:22,000
[SPEAKER_10]: Because when I door knocked my first campaign,

499
00:58:22,992 --> 00:58:25,394
[SPEAKER_10]: I was on a street right outside of high street.

500
00:58:26,094 --> 00:58:31,237
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can't remember the woman I spoke to, but she said, Oh no, all the people on the street, like we've been here for generations.

501
00:58:31,697 --> 00:58:33,599
[SPEAKER_10]: We would never have sent our kids to the public schools.

502
00:58:33,639 --> 00:58:35,780
[SPEAKER_10]: We moved here because the taxes were really low.

503
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:37,501
[SPEAKER_10]: We could get a big, beautiful house.

504
00:58:37,961 --> 00:58:40,023
[SPEAKER_10]: And with that, we could send our kids to private school.

505
00:58:40,953 --> 00:58:42,654
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not the community I want to live in.

506
00:58:42,774 --> 00:58:51,259
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to live in a community where the public schools are something we joyfully send our kids to and want our neighbors to also feel like that's the place to go.

507
00:58:51,820 --> 00:59:06,709
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was not meant as a rebuttal in any way, shape or form, but this lack of confidence by the public in our schools, which, you know, every time we meet where we say really great things are happening and they are,

508
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:14,795
[SPEAKER_10]: but an awful lot of people aren't hearing the message and they certainly have a message that they're passing down to their friends and their kids.

509
00:59:15,715 --> 00:59:19,137
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're not doing anything to rebut that at all.

510
00:59:19,897 --> 00:59:20,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

511
00:59:21,418 --> 00:59:21,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

512
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:22,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Member McLaughlin.

513
00:59:23,379 --> 00:59:23,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

514
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:32,123
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually just wanted to say, you know, I think that this is a complicated issue and not one to discuss on the floor at the last meeting of our year.

515
00:59:32,683 --> 00:59:36,905
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also wanted to say, I do think that there are lots of great things happening in Medford public schools,

516
00:59:37,592 --> 00:59:44,058
[SPEAKER_06]: And that if there are folks watching or listening, I hope that they won't be dissuaded to send their kids here because I think there's lots of great schools.

517
00:59:44,098 --> 00:59:44,819
[SPEAKER_06]: I have three kids.

518
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:47,061
[SPEAKER_06]: We had the option of sending them to private school.

519
00:59:47,101 --> 00:59:47,581
[SPEAKER_06]: We did not.

520
00:59:47,621 --> 00:59:48,862
[SPEAKER_06]: We wanted Medford public schools.

521
00:59:49,303 --> 00:59:54,687
[SPEAKER_06]: We specifically chose Medford high school for the wonderful diversity it offers.

522
00:59:55,128 --> 00:59:58,090
[SPEAKER_06]: There are over 300 countries represented in our high school.

523
00:59:58,471 --> 01:00:00,833
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't buy that kind of diversity anywhere.

524
01:00:01,266 --> 01:00:04,227
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to say I think that there's a lot of good things happening in our schools.

525
01:00:04,587 --> 01:00:16,169
[SPEAKER_06]: We are here to make our schools better and we all think that the mayor and everyone else included is here for that and so I just want to make sure that we're all on the same page that we are making our schools better but they also are very good schools.

526
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:16,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

527
01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:22,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, just to piggyback on that I mean to give you all credit of the school committee works hard.

528
01:00:22,898 --> 01:00:42,752
[SPEAKER_09]: for for the children of this community and all the staff and you know you asked the city administration for five and a half million dollars over last year's budget for this current year's budget and that's something that I have to obviously weigh and work with CFO on but but I appreciate that and I think the residents should know that

529
01:00:43,231 --> 01:00:47,873
[SPEAKER_09]: city side is as close to level funded this year as possible because of the situation we're in.

530
01:00:48,313 --> 01:00:55,136
[SPEAKER_09]: But we were able because I wanted to make sure that we gave as much as we could to the schools, which is close to a two and a half percent increase.

531
01:00:55,616 --> 01:01:03,980
[SPEAKER_09]: And when we did have the money last year, the city side stayed within the means that we could so we could give the schools a 9% increase when the money's there.

532
01:01:04,801 --> 01:01:05,581
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to do it.

533
01:01:05,701 --> 01:01:10,403
[SPEAKER_09]: So anybody that says the city doesn't care about our kids or that I don't care about the kids is

534
01:01:10,991 --> 01:01:13,632
[SPEAKER_09]: 100% that is 100% false.

535
01:01:13,792 --> 01:01:15,273
[SPEAKER_09]: I too have three kids in schools.

536
01:01:15,413 --> 01:01:17,354
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the schools are fabulous.

537
01:01:17,474 --> 01:01:21,415
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the school committee works really hard to push me for as much as you can.

538
01:01:21,916 --> 01:01:23,656
[SPEAKER_09]: You can get, I appreciate that.

539
01:01:23,736 --> 01:01:26,477
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you do it respectfully, I really appreciate it.

540
01:01:27,418 --> 01:01:28,738
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're in this situation.

541
01:01:28,878 --> 01:01:29,639
[SPEAKER_09]: We know where we're at.

542
01:01:29,679 --> 01:01:31,660
[SPEAKER_09]: We know we have to wean off of one-time funding.

543
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,020
[SPEAKER_09]: We have plans to do that.

544
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:37,282
[SPEAKER_09]: We're gonna start budgeting and taking the necessary steps starting July 1

545
01:01:38,083 --> 01:01:39,243
[SPEAKER_09]: especially on the city side.

546
01:01:39,283 --> 01:01:52,786
[SPEAKER_09]: I know Dave and superintendent will be doing it on the school side, figuring out how, how we can get through the next couple of years that are going to be tough, but I think, I think we can do it and we can work together and do it in the best way for our students and staff.

547
01:01:54,146 --> 01:01:55,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Murphy, is there anything else to add?

548
01:01:56,787 --> 01:01:57,647
[SPEAKER_01]: No, just get that.

549
01:01:57,727 --> 01:01:58,507
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a public hearing.

550
01:01:58,547 --> 01:02:01,228
[SPEAKER_01]: If there are any other questions or comments, I'd love to take them.

551
01:02:09,315 --> 01:02:10,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other questions from the committee?

552
01:02:12,577 --> 01:02:15,959
[SPEAKER_01]: So if that's the case, what I would recommend is a vote to close the public hearing.

553
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:26,366
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, as I said later this evening, I'll give you what I would anticipate being your final budget update, at least at this phase of the budget process.

554
01:02:27,507 --> 01:02:28,787
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd ask for a vote at that time.

555
01:02:29,508 --> 01:02:36,012
[SPEAKER_01]: And then subsequent to that, some of these other variables settle out.

556
01:02:36,613 --> 01:02:39,874
[SPEAKER_01]: there'll be more information related to the ESSER budget that we'll share with you.

557
01:02:40,554 --> 01:02:41,295
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think to Ms.

558
01:02:41,335 --> 01:02:47,337
[SPEAKER_01]: Graham's point, that'll be a regular feature of your agendas going forward in fiscal year 23.

559
01:02:47,697 --> 01:02:54,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a motion to close this open meeting, budget meeting by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Kreatz.

560
01:02:54,599 --> 01:02:56,000
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call, please.

[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, some of the affirmatives are in the negative.

573
01:03:09,010 --> 01:03:09,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Public hearing is closed.

01:03:57,010 --> 01:03:57,370
[SPEAKER_09]: Present.

599
01:03:57,790 --> 01:03:59,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Six present, one who must have went

600
01:04:00,923 --> 01:04:01,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Snuck out for a minute.

601
01:04:02,144 --> 01:04:04,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there any student representatives on the call?

602
01:04:05,567 --> 01:04:06,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Not tonight.

603
01:04:06,308 --> 01:04:08,609
[SPEAKER_09]: If we may all rise to salute the flag one more time, please.

604
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:19,158
[SPEAKER_09]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

605
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:22,381
[SPEAKER_09]: Number three, we have good of the order.

606
01:04:23,862 --> 01:04:24,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin.

607
01:04:25,583 --> 01:04:26,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

608
01:04:26,644 --> 01:04:29,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for including this on the agenda.

609
01:04:29,066 --> 01:04:30,007
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we missed it last.

610
01:04:31,171 --> 01:04:33,032
[SPEAKER_06]: meeting, which is usually the beginning of the month.

611
01:04:33,752 --> 01:04:46,136
[SPEAKER_06]: The good of the order is an opportunity for us to discuss the working of the school committee and sort of any suggestions or anything else that the school committee body wants to put forward in terms of our work.

612
01:04:46,377 --> 01:04:49,177
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I had two that I wanted to bring up.

613
01:04:49,378 --> 01:04:52,219
[SPEAKER_06]: One is the student representative.

614
01:04:52,579 --> 01:04:56,180
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know Dr. Cushon talked a little bit about some of the

615
01:04:56,701 --> 01:05:10,207
[SPEAKER_06]: protocol for next year for a student representative, but I wanna know how we can ensure that we are gonna have a student representative at our monthly or bi-monthly meetings, at least, because we need some student voice.

616
01:05:10,587 --> 01:05:12,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Cushing, I don't know if you're hearing me.

617
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:20,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Cushing, student representatives, will they, can we confirm, make sure we confirm them for next school year?

618
01:05:29,279 --> 01:05:35,843
[SPEAKER_06]: And can we also have an alternate so that if one if a student does need to miss that there's some another student that can attend this year we had.

619
01:05:36,363 --> 01:05:49,591
[SPEAKER_06]: The majority of the year without student representatives and when the students did come and were able to speak to us, they had some really valuable input, so I just want to make sure that we have a student at all of the next meeting so maybe not alternate alternate as well.

620
01:05:51,492 --> 01:05:51,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

621
01:05:53,331 --> 01:05:53,952
[SPEAKER_06]: If I may, Mayor?

622
01:05:54,372 --> 01:05:55,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Member McLaughlin.

623
01:05:55,592 --> 01:05:59,054
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the next one is goals, school committee goals.

624
01:05:59,714 --> 01:06:07,457
[SPEAKER_06]: So MASC, I was reviewing some of the MASC recommendations for school committee and some of the courses that they offer.

625
01:06:07,497 --> 01:06:09,498
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that we've taken courses in the past.

626
01:06:10,298 --> 01:06:18,822
[SPEAKER_06]: The past two years have been an anomaly, obviously, with the pandemic, but I really think that as a body, it would be great for us to

627
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:26,902
[SPEAKER_06]: create some goals ourselves and also have some monitoring of our progress on those goals and or accountability to the community.

628
01:06:27,382 --> 01:06:46,768
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would really like to suggest to my colleagues that in a September meeting that we're able to have a meeting where we set some goals for the year, and then in the May meeting or April meeting, we have some accountability towards those goals, much like the superintendent has goals.

629
01:06:46,848 --> 01:06:49,069
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, the idea is that our goals would be

630
01:06:51,585 --> 01:06:59,009
[SPEAKER_06]: our vision and goals would be close to the superintendents or ideas close to the superintendents, but it's still good to define as a body ourselves, those goals.

631
01:06:59,049 --> 01:07:04,532
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to put that to the floor under the good of the order and ask my colleagues for their comments and thoughts.

632
01:07:04,612 --> 01:07:04,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

633
01:07:08,355 --> 01:07:09,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Graham.

634
01:07:10,536 --> 01:07:17,340
[SPEAKER_05]: I fully support this committee convening to articulate a set of goals that would last a year.

635
01:07:19,313 --> 01:07:23,979
[SPEAKER_05]: As it stands right now, there's a really ambitious agenda times seven.

636
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:29,545
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's very difficult if there's no rhyme or reason to how that agenda comes forward.

637
01:07:30,286 --> 01:07:32,389
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it is in part.

638
01:07:32,936 --> 01:07:39,542
[SPEAKER_05]: know, exacerbating the situation where the administration is telling us we can't do more, we can't do that too.

639
01:07:41,063 --> 01:07:47,849
[SPEAKER_05]: And in all fairness, a better plan would allow us all to know what's ahead and be more effective.

640
01:07:47,909 --> 01:07:49,410
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm completely in support.

641
01:07:51,832 --> 01:07:53,274
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to make a motion to

642
01:07:54,545 --> 01:08:04,708
[SPEAKER_06]: have a goals meeting at the beginning of next year for school committee with some accountability measures included in the goals meeting so that we can report out at the end of the year how we did on those goals.

643
01:08:05,089 --> 01:08:05,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

644
01:08:06,509 --> 01:08:12,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion for approval by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Graham.

645
01:08:13,331 --> 01:08:14,052
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

646
01:08:14,292 --> 01:08:14,672
