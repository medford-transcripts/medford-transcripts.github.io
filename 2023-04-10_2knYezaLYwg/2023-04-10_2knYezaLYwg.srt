[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my gosh.

59
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:27,357
[SPEAKER_10]: I know it's very gorgeous, but yes.

60
00:38:27,377 --> 00:38:29,660
[SPEAKER_11]: That was wonderful.

61
00:39:17,978 --> 00:39:19,799
[SPEAKER_11]: She's got to spread her wings.

62
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:54,541
[SPEAKER_11]: We're excited about the big lottery.

63
00:40:32,076 --> 00:40:42,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Bills and payrolls, minutes from the committee of the whole budget, FY 24 meeting held April 3rd and minutes from the sixth regular school committee meeting held April 3rd.

64
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:43,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham?

65
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:44,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

66
00:40:45,481 --> 00:40:48,162
[SPEAKER_02]: I have an issue with the minutes from the last meeting.

67
00:40:49,577 --> 00:40:50,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to sever.

68
00:40:50,977 --> 00:40:52,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to sever by Member McLaughlin.

69
00:40:55,718 --> 00:40:57,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Seconded by Member Mustone.

70
00:40:57,278 --> 00:40:57,919
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

71
00:40:57,939 --> 00:40:58,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

72
00:40:58,399 --> 00:41:01,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Member McLaughlin.

73
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:12,001
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the minutes from the last meeting, just on the last page, it just says, when we were talking with Ms.

74
00:41:12,021 --> 00:41:16,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Fidler-Carey about the before school and after school program,

75
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:20,401
[SPEAKER_02]: And she was mentioning that there would be wraparound paraprofessionals.

76
00:41:20,441 --> 00:41:24,823
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had asked if that would open more opportunities for students with disabilities.

77
00:41:24,863 --> 00:41:33,749
[SPEAKER_02]: And she said, she believed it would, but in the, let's see, halfway up, it says member McLaughlin follows up and is asking slash looking for confirmation.

78
00:41:34,549 --> 00:41:39,412
[SPEAKER_02]: If not opening it up to students with disabilities, they have access to the programming regardless.

79
00:41:39,492 --> 00:41:45,416
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to clarify that I'm not, I was not asking or looking for confirmation.

80
00:41:45,956 --> 00:41:46,677
[SPEAKER_02]: I was stating,

81
00:41:47,236 --> 00:41:57,126
[SPEAKER_02]: that students with disabilities have access to before and after school programming, regardless of wraparound services and wraparound paraprofessionals.

82
00:41:57,146 --> 00:41:59,008
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just asking for that clarification.

83
00:41:59,929 --> 00:42:00,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I need to make a motion?

84
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:02,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a motion to approve as amended?

85
00:42:02,612 --> 00:42:03,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to approve as amended.

86
00:42:04,013 --> 00:42:04,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

87
00:42:05,285 --> 00:42:14,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, motion to approve the April 3rd regular school committee meeting minutes as amended by member Rousseau, seconded by member McLaughlin.

88
00:42:14,988 --> 00:42:15,789
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

89
00:42:15,809 --> 00:42:16,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

90
00:42:16,529 --> 00:42:16,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

91
00:42:16,989 --> 00:42:17,649
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

92
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:22,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I think we still have a need proof.

93
00:42:23,271 --> 00:42:29,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, motion to approve the consent agenda, which includes bills and payrolls and the committee of the whole budget meeting held on April 3rd.

94
00:42:30,053 --> 00:42:34,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to approve by member McLaughlin, seconded by member Rousseau.

95
00:42:35,046 --> 00:42:35,706
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

96
00:42:35,726 --> 00:42:36,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

97
00:42:36,767 --> 00:42:37,447
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

98
00:42:38,348 --> 00:42:38,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

99
00:42:41,089 --> 00:42:42,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Item number four, report of subcommittees.

100
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:49,312
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the minutes of the rules and policy subcommittee held on March 28th, 2023.

101
00:42:49,393 --> 00:42:49,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Ruseau?

102
00:42:51,594 --> 00:42:51,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

103
00:42:52,614 --> 00:42:55,956
[SPEAKER_07]: I have too many windows open.

104
00:42:56,016 --> 00:42:56,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, one moment.

105
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:04,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

106
00:43:05,272 --> 00:43:07,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

107
00:43:08,034 --> 00:43:08,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, thank you.

108
00:43:08,654 --> 00:43:16,778
[SPEAKER_07]: So we met on April 3 2023 to continue discussions on the bullying prevention and intervention plan.

109
00:43:17,798 --> 00:43:24,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Our agenda was a little off kilter because we were hoping our attorney would be with us but

110
00:43:25,175 --> 00:43:26,697
[SPEAKER_07]: That was not an option that night.

111
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:37,326
[SPEAKER_07]: So we discussed how to proceed with the document and at the next meeting, which will be on the 28th, I believe.

112
00:43:38,728 --> 00:43:40,009
[SPEAKER_07]: One moment, I do have that right here.

113
00:43:40,029 --> 00:43:46,935
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the, okay, 26th, 25th.

114
00:43:50,982 --> 00:43:53,803
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have it in my calendar, even though I know I put it in my calendar.

115
00:43:53,823 --> 00:43:54,423
[SPEAKER_07]: So forgive me.

116
00:43:54,863 --> 00:44:17,430
[SPEAKER_07]: At our next meeting, which is coming up this month, the end of the month, we will be working with our attorney to go through all of the recommendations that he had, as well as bringing forth a proposed new document and new format, rather than trying to work through the 38 pages one line at a time.

117
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:22,222
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a lot of great conversation that the minutes explain.

118
00:44:23,022 --> 00:44:33,947
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hoping that the next meeting is either the last or second to the last meeting on this plan, and that we'll be able to make enough progress to get this buttoned up before the end of the school year.

119
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:38,449
[SPEAKER_03]: And just as a point of clarification, the meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, April 25th.

120
00:44:38,549 --> 00:44:41,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a motion to approve the minutes?

121
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:42,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to approve.

122
00:44:43,011 --> 00:44:45,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to approve the minutes by Member McLaughlin, seconded by?

123
00:44:47,076 --> 00:44:48,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Hays, all those in favor?

124
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:50,279
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

125
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:51,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

126
00:44:56,145 --> 00:44:58,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Item number five, the report of the superintendent.

127
00:44:59,188 --> 00:45:01,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Updates and comments, Dr. Edward-Vinson.

128
00:45:02,271 --> 00:45:03,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, good evening.

129
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:10,980
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope that everyone had a joyful Easter and Passover gatherings this past weekend.

130
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:27,479
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to inform the committee that last week, our AI are completed their Jesse completed their visit with Medford public schools that approximately 100 classrooms.

131
00:45:30,121 --> 00:45:36,206
[SPEAKER_04]: were observed, they conducted countless interviews of administrators, school committee members.

132
00:45:36,906 --> 00:45:47,495
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we look forward to getting that report back and learning from what Dessy has to share with us from the district.

133
00:45:47,956 --> 00:45:52,840
[SPEAKER_04]: And this special review takes place about once every 10 years or so.

134
00:45:53,420 --> 00:46:02,167
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm hoping and looking forward to the results of all of the work that they did, our review.

135
00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:19,921
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to thank Professor Regina Millen from the University, from UMass Lowell, UMass Lowell's Graphic Design and Illustration program, who came to speak to both our art students and our graphic design students.

136
00:46:20,801 --> 00:46:31,803
[SPEAKER_04]: She did talk about the UMass Laurel program and spoke about different career paths that are available to our students in the graphic and design and illustration fields.

137
00:46:32,584 --> 00:46:43,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Similar to the women in the construction, electrical, robotics, and welding fields, as well as the women leaders who spoke to students to celebrate Women's History Month.

138
00:46:44,106 --> 00:46:48,867
[SPEAKER_04]: So these speakers present real life future options for all of our students.

139
00:46:50,729 --> 00:46:58,759
[SPEAKER_04]: I also want to talk about our one of our vocational programs which is working collaboratively with the Medford family network.

140
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:06,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of our graphic design students have been working very very diligently on designing.

141
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:16,472
[SPEAKER_04]: with special permission from the authors, they have scanned and taken books, 10 books in total.

142
00:47:17,192 --> 00:47:23,034
[SPEAKER_04]: And this project involves students using a special machine where they print the books.

143
00:47:23,934 --> 00:47:25,475
[SPEAKER_04]: They use Adobe Illustrator.

144
00:47:26,055 --> 00:47:28,315
[SPEAKER_04]: The special machine is a Roland 54 inch VersaCam.

145
00:47:30,816 --> 00:47:34,299
[SPEAKER_04]: and they laminate the books and they add granites.

146
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:42,665
[SPEAKER_04]: And these books are going to be posted to fences in some of the parks throughout Medford.

147
00:47:43,166 --> 00:47:52,693
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's wonderful to see our students working collaboratively with the Medford Family Network and making a difference in our community.

148
00:47:53,273 --> 00:47:56,436
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're very excited and happy about the work that they're doing there.

149
00:47:57,276 --> 00:48:06,459
[SPEAKER_04]: I also want to recognize our Mustang marching band, because they will be traveling to Florida.

150
00:48:06,739 --> 00:48:12,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes to Disney Springs at Walt Disney World next week so they're leaving on Saturday, and.

151
00:48:14,501 --> 00:48:16,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thank you, Member Mustone.

152
00:48:17,803 --> 00:48:25,609
[SPEAKER_04]: They leave on Wednesday, and on Saturday, April 15th at 1230, I believe that's their performance.

153
00:48:25,889 --> 00:48:27,550
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's their big performance.

154
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:31,112
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the group of students that are going by train.

155
00:48:31,192 --> 00:48:33,474
[SPEAKER_04]: So we talk about trains, planes, and automobiles.

156
00:48:34,755 --> 00:48:43,961
[SPEAKER_04]: We look forward to them performing well and coming back to maybe share with us a highlight or two about the adventure on their way down to Disney.

157
00:48:44,661 --> 00:48:49,623

240
00:58:52,196 --> 00:59:08,506
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening and welcome everybody, thank you for giving us this opportunity to speak a little bit about the transition of many of our Medford public school students from fifth grade to sixth grade and certainly I wanna welcome all those come on Wednesday, when they get selected for the McGlynn middle school.

241
00:59:08,996 --> 00:59:15,017
[SPEAKER_01]: and I can't wait to be their principal as their sixth grade and middle school year kind of commences, years commence.

242
00:59:15,077 --> 00:59:35,981
[SPEAKER_01]: So today I'm just going to spend a little bit of time giving you all an opportunity to hear a little bit about the presentation that I know you have in front of you that students and families are going to get when they arrive at the McGlynn Middle School on Tuesday, May 2nd, which is the day of the sixth grade open house for students that are going to be coming to the McGlynn Middle School.

243
00:59:36,829 --> 00:59:43,595
[SPEAKER_01]: So when students arrive at our school on Tuesday, May 2nd, they're going to be funneled into our auditorium.

244
00:59:44,056 --> 00:59:49,901
[SPEAKER_01]: And from there, we're going to deliver an opening presentation led by myself and my assistant principal, Mr. John Bruno.

245
00:59:49,921 --> 01:00:02,493
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're gonna have a couple of special speakers, a student who is going to be speaking a little bit about their experiences and sharing some reflections as to how to find success transitioning from elementary to middle school.

246
01:00:03,459 --> 01:00:06,719
[SPEAKER_01]: After our presentation that we're going to deliver in the auditorium.

247
01:00:07,432 --> 01:00:17,901
[SPEAKER_01]: students are gonna go to the best part of the open house experience where they'll do a scavenger hunt that'll be led by a sixth grade teacher and also a student ambassador.

248
01:00:18,361 --> 01:00:24,687
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to engage in this opportunity to hunt throughout the school and try to visit a number of different stops.

249
01:00:25,428 --> 01:00:31,072
[SPEAKER_01]: And including your package, you can see stops like they'll go into a sample art classroom or a Spanish classroom.

250
01:00:31,413 --> 01:00:33,755
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll have an opportunity to go to our curriculum fair.

251
01:00:34,635 --> 01:00:41,620
[SPEAKER_01]: where they'll learn about the different offerings that we have from our curriculum standpoint, English language arts and science and math and social studies.

252
01:00:42,621 --> 01:00:52,527
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they'll have an opportunity to visit our club and activities fair, which is one of our biggest tips for how you can find success transition from elementary and middle school is to join a club, get involved in the life of the school.

253
01:00:53,027 --> 01:00:56,930
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to give them a little taste of what some of those offerings are going to be like.

254
01:00:57,866 --> 01:01:06,230
[SPEAKER_01]: In between some of their stops, they'll go by a performance by Mrs. Chang's wonderful strings ensemble or the wonderful band that we have.

255
01:01:06,350 --> 01:01:12,673
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll be kind of greeted as they arrive in the school and make their way from stop to stop with some wonderful musical performances.

256
01:01:13,473 --> 01:01:21,657
[SPEAKER_01]: And over the course of this opportunity, they're going to have the chance to interact with classmates, teachers, and certainly

257
01:01:22,856 --> 01:01:28,171
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, some of our student ambassadors that will be kind of like answering their questions and getting them from stop to stop.

258
01:01:29,079 --> 01:01:38,745
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is our hope at the end of the evening presentation, students and families will be welcomed back into the cafeteria for a little bit of slush and opportunity to socialize and ask further questions.

259
01:01:39,205 --> 01:01:45,609
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really want to give them every opportunity to make a really good transition into a welcoming, awesome school environment.

260
01:01:46,509 --> 01:01:54,294
[SPEAKER_01]: So from my standpoint, while this week is filled with preparations for, you know, having a really solid week before April vacation,

261
01:01:54,694 --> 01:02:01,880
[SPEAKER_01]: We have MCAS testing this week for English Language Arts on Tuesday and Thursday, and we're wishing our families and students a wonderful MCAS season.

262
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:14,170
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to also welcome on board our incoming class, and I really can't wait to get to know them and give them every opportunity to feel comfortable making this important transition in their educational career.

263
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:18,173
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I do every year, I want to just put it out there to the community that

264
01:02:19,699 --> 01:02:27,164
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the summertime, I'm gonna have office hours where I'll be able to invite families to come in and they can sign up to come in and meet with me or just drop by.

265
01:02:27,684 --> 01:02:38,151
[SPEAKER_01]: I plan to have office hours where I'll be out in the schoolyard shooting hoops and just inviting people to come on by and shoot hoops to the principal and get to know me and learn a little bit about what the middle school experience is going to be like.

266
01:02:38,651 --> 01:02:46,396
[SPEAKER_01]: So every opportunity that we have to help our students and families make this transition to middle school, this is what we're all about and interested in doing at this point in time.

267
01:02:47,293 --> 01:02:49,154
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you all for your time.

268
01:02:49,174 --> 01:02:51,956
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have any questions for me, I'm happy to take them right now.

269
01:02:53,837 --> 01:02:56,118
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, I'll turn it over to Principal Downs too as well.

270

01:03:18,286 --> 01:03:25,088
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, Andrews is, of course, as we all know, is a great school named after Madeline Duggar Andrews, our first woman of color elected in Medford.

285
01:03:25,108 --> 01:03:26,408
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're very proud of that fact.

286
01:03:26,949 --> 01:03:28,489
[SPEAKER_00]: We say it quite often at the Andrews.

287
01:03:29,196 --> 01:03:38,566
[SPEAKER_00]: And our motto at the Andrews if you want to go through is excellence through responsibility and respect and part of that, of course, is treating everyone with kindness being responsible for your actions.

288
01:03:39,212 --> 01:03:42,254
[SPEAKER_00]: making sure that you do the best that you can each and every day.

289
01:03:42,274 --> 01:03:43,655
[SPEAKER_00]: We say this quite a bit.

290
01:03:44,296 --> 01:03:50,901
[SPEAKER_00]: And my next slide that kind of goes along with that, we actually take time every year to go over manners.

291
01:03:51,541 --> 01:03:54,803
[SPEAKER_00]: As my mother used to say, gimme's don't get anything that you don't want.

292
01:03:55,084 --> 01:04:04,711
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tell our kids, make sure you say please and thank yous, be kind to all the adults in the building, especially our support staff, our CAF staff.

293
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:12,195
[SPEAKER_00]: We feel that manners is something that will go forward with them for the rest of their life if they choose to listen to us when we do these presentations.

294
01:04:12,876 --> 01:04:15,978
[SPEAKER_00]: But we feel it's an important part of developing young children.

295
01:04:16,818 --> 01:04:26,004
[SPEAKER_00]: On the next slide, in class, we ask students, again, to do the best that they can, to be respectful of their classmates, be on time, be prepared.

296
01:04:26,576 --> 01:04:27,996
[SPEAKER_00]: All these are really life lessons.

297
01:04:28,097 --> 01:04:30,417
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is part of what we do in middle school.

298
01:04:30,917 --> 01:04:39,520
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we teach academics and yes, we have lots of fun activities and events and clubs, but at the end of the day, our job is to also help them grow as individuals.

299
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:41,881
[SPEAKER_00]: And we take this very seriously at the Andrews.

300
01:04:42,761 --> 01:04:46,422
[SPEAKER_00]: I just hope whoever is after me will see it that way as well.

301
01:04:46,762 --> 01:04:48,683
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't make any promises, but I'm sure they will.

302
01:04:49,883 --> 01:04:50,904
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the next slide,

303
01:04:51,904 --> 01:04:57,547
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of our basics, we're doing this presentation, part of this presentation will be at our open house, which is on May 4th.

304
01:04:58,107 --> 01:05:01,288
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking forward to meeting our sixth graders, our incoming sixth graders.

305
01:05:02,089 --> 01:05:04,470
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think communication is a huge piece.

306
01:05:04,790 --> 01:05:10,572
[SPEAKER_00]: I know here at the school community, communication to the community is a big part of what you're trying to achieve.

307
01:05:10,752 --> 01:05:11,933
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do that at the Andrews.

308
01:05:12,673 --> 01:05:17,255
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that are parents at my school, you know that my communication is pretty succinct.

309
01:05:17,755 --> 01:05:18,976
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not wordy.

310
01:05:19,136 --> 01:05:21,057
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty much bullet form for the most part,

311
01:05:21,735 --> 01:05:26,100
[SPEAKER_00]: People are tired at the end of the day and the last thing they want to do is read about my soliloquies on education.

312
01:05:26,261 --> 01:05:29,244
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do that quite often, of course.

313
01:05:29,344 --> 01:05:30,285
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our student of the month.

314
01:05:30,866 --> 01:05:32,488
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our big breakfast at the end of the year.

315
01:05:32,508 --> 01:05:38,576
[SPEAKER_00]: The best part about the breakfast at the end of the year is grandma and grandpa usually get to come and it's a big moment for them as well.

316
01:05:39,216 --> 01:05:41,897
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're gonna go on to the next one.

317
01:05:41,957 --> 01:05:43,117
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our daily schedule.

318
01:05:44,137 --> 01:05:50,318
[SPEAKER_00]: Our schedule for our sixth graders in particular is blocks two and eight are their exploratory time, block five is their lunch.

319
01:05:50,518 --> 01:05:56,299
[SPEAKER_00]: And we provide them with an example of a schedule so that they don't get too nervous about what their day is going to look like.

320
01:05:57,160 --> 01:06:02,181
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, we want them to restart on time and be there in their homeroom area by 7.50.

321
01:06:02,241 --> 01:06:04,041
[SPEAKER_00]: Next slide, please, Dr. V.

322
01:06:05,717 --> 01:06:06,958
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Cushing, whoever's doing it.

323
01:06:07,738 --> 01:06:19,865
[SPEAKER_00]: We have lots and lots of clubs and activities and the great part about the Andrews and McGlynn is we share our clubs and activities, which is great for students who in particular in the sixth grade who are now separated from the classmates for the first time in their life.

324
01:06:20,525 --> 01:06:26,489
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they have an opportunity to hang out with them after school in a productive way to learn many different things.

325
01:06:27,129 --> 01:06:35,258
[SPEAKER_00]: The one club I'm going to shout out because it took me four years to get the money for I did a grant and we have a robots club now with real robots on.

326
01:06:35,579 --> 01:06:40,244
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately my, my advisor is an eighth grader miles Hilliard if your parents are watching.

327
01:06:41,946 --> 01:06:43,667
[SPEAKER_00]: He is moving on to the high school next year.

328
01:06:44,087 --> 01:06:48,090
[SPEAKER_00]: And without him, I don't know who's going to be able to put the robots together.

329
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:52,113
[SPEAKER_00]: But hopefully, somebody's learned this year, some sixth grader.

330
01:06:52,373 --> 01:06:55,075
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I have one named Cal who's doing quite well with it.

331
01:06:55,135 --> 01:06:57,536
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully, they'll continue that little thing.

332
01:06:57,616 --> 01:06:58,977
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, we're part of the MGL.

333
01:06:59,978 --> 01:07:01,799
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, the Boston Sport League.

334
01:07:01,819 --> 01:07:03,960
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very fortunate to be part of that as well.

335
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:06,262
[SPEAKER_00]: Next slide, please, Dr. Cushing.

336
01:07:06,862 --> 01:07:07,222
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, yep.

337
01:07:08,863 --> 01:07:11,606
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is some activities that we put in here.

338
01:07:11,746 --> 01:07:19,474
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we have lots and lots of activities, everything from sports to crafts and things that one of the big things, of course, is CCSR.

339
01:07:19,594 --> 01:07:22,217
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Mr. Tucci has his CCSR as well.

340
01:07:23,138 --> 01:07:27,803
[SPEAKER_00]: They do a lot of great things for our school, including fundraising, et cetera.

341
01:07:27,843 --> 01:07:28,964
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next one, please.

342
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,181
[SPEAKER_00]: And just a little Mustang pride.

343
01:07:34,362 --> 01:07:35,843
[SPEAKER_00]: We want kids to be happy at our school.

344
01:07:35,963 --> 01:07:40,005
[SPEAKER_00]: For the most part, they are, I would say, most days, except after MCAS.

345
01:07:42,146 --> 01:07:44,788
[SPEAKER_00]: Community service is a huge part of our school.

346
01:07:45,288 --> 01:07:52,152
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you who have been parents in my school, you know that I've done several food drives in the last few years, especially since the pandemic.

347
01:07:52,752 --> 01:07:55,034
[SPEAKER_00]: and clothing drives and school supply drives.

348
01:07:55,875 --> 01:07:58,237
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope whoever takes over after me continues that.

349
01:07:59,278 --> 01:08:07,466
[SPEAKER_00]: This year alone, I raised over $2,500 in gift cards from members of my school community to give to families in need, especially during the holiday season.

350
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:11,970
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is something that's probably the thing I'm most proud of, just giving to those in our

351
01:08:12,951 --> 01:08:14,733
[SPEAKER_00]: city part of Mustang Nation.

352
01:08:15,393 --> 01:08:23,260
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that's something that people will remember long after I'm gone that when times when they needed them, I was able to help them in a small way.

353
01:08:24,001 --> 01:08:27,764
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you know, we try to help our fellow Mustangs out as much as we can.

354
01:08:28,344 --> 01:08:35,190
[SPEAKER_00]: We are currently also did a cereal box drive with Melanie North and CCSR and hundreds of boxes of cereal.

355
01:08:35,310 --> 01:08:40,855
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it sounds minor, but you know, kids need breakfast and she was able to provide that for hundreds of families.

356
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:44,271
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a couple of pictures in here at the end.

357
01:08:44,571 --> 01:08:46,391
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna try to catch up our tree of warmth.

358
01:08:47,292 --> 01:08:48,712
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's a big hit every year.

359
01:08:48,872 --> 01:08:51,953
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna give a shout out to miss Kathy O'Donoghue, 7B.

360
01:08:52,333 --> 01:08:53,134
[SPEAKER_00]: This is her baby.

361
01:08:53,954 --> 01:08:57,155
[SPEAKER_00]: And the tree of warmth, as you can see, is hats, gloves, and mittens.

362
01:08:57,535 --> 01:09:01,376
[SPEAKER_00]: Any student at any time may grab a pair or a hat if they need it.

363
01:09:01,976 --> 01:09:04,997
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have found that most kids take it if they really do need it.

364
01:09:05,157 --> 01:09:09,979
[SPEAKER_00]: And then whatever is left at the end of the holiday season, we donate to local charities.

365
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:11,880
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big part of who we are.

366
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:14,602
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we have newsletters to go out by teams.

367
01:09:14,982 --> 01:09:18,024
[SPEAKER_00]: I put some hyperlinks in there for some of our team newsletters.

368
01:09:18,924 --> 01:09:20,225
[SPEAKER_00]: We do those every month.

369
01:09:20,385 --> 01:09:21,866
[SPEAKER_00]: Each team does a different one.

370
01:09:23,007 --> 01:09:23,927
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that's it.

371
01:09:24,548 --> 01:09:28,770
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't want to be too long and too short at the same time, but you know, succinct.

372
01:09:29,031 --> 01:09:29,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

373
01:09:29,671 --> 01:09:30,011
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

374
01:09:30,492 --> 01:09:30,812
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

375
01:09:31,792 --> 01:09:32,233
[SPEAKER_12]: You're welcome.

376
01:09:32,253 --> 01:09:32,733
[SPEAKER_12]: Tree of warmth.

377
01:09:32,753 --> 01:09:33,313
[SPEAKER_12]: That's wonderful.

378
01:09:33,473 --> 01:09:34,454
[SPEAKER_12]: Member McLaughlin.

379
01:09:37,579 --> 01:09:41,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I just wanted to say thank you, Mr. Downs, for your service to Medford.

380
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:43,541
[SPEAKER_02]: And Haverhill's gain is Medford's loss.

381
01:09:43,581 --> 01:09:44,641
[SPEAKER_02]: We wish you all the best.

382
01:09:44,661 --> 01:09:51,644
[SPEAKER_02]: We know you're going to do well, and I'm glad you're getting back to the Valley and will be part of the Merrimack Valley that so needs you.

383
01:09:51,724 --> 01:09:52,865
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

384
01:09:52,885 --> 01:09:54,585
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.

385
01:09:54,625 --> 01:09:55,045
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do.

386
01:09:55,106 --> 01:09:55,706
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.

387
01:09:57,727 --> 01:09:58,347
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, everyone.

388
01:09:58,387 --> 01:09:59,387
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the presentation.

389
01:09:59,427 --> 01:10:00,067
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a nice evening, everyone.

390
01:10:00,087 --> 01:10:00,708
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.

391
01:10:00,768 --> 01:10:01,028
[SPEAKER_12]: Take care.

392
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:07,362
[SPEAKER_12]: Number three, we have recommendation to approve overnight travel to Marlborough for SkillsUSA students.

393
01:10:07,602 --> 01:10:10,263
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Chad Fallon, principal, will be presenting.

394
01:10:12,604 --> 01:10:16,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I thought Principal Fallon was gonna be on Zoom.

395
01:10:16,645 --> 01:10:17,425
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they were.

396
01:10:17,445 --> 01:10:21,447
[SPEAKER_12]: We can take maybe a motion to table or does anybody else?

397
01:10:21,747 --> 01:10:27,749
[SPEAKER_04]: I can present his request for SkillsUSA.

398
01:10:33,752 --> 01:10:34,933
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's find my report.

399
01:10:34,953 --> 01:10:35,133
Okay.

400
01:10:52,170 --> 01:10:55,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Graham, would you kindly read it because I'm not seeing it right now.

401
01:10:55,671 --> 01:10:56,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

402
01:10:56,472 --> 01:10:56,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

403
01:10:57,492 --> 01:11:00,953
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do my best Principal Fallon voice and try to move quickly.

404
01:11:02,214 --> 01:11:08,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Each year Medford Vocational Technical High School joins other vocational schools from across the state to compete in their respective career technical area.

405
01:11:08,716 --> 01:11:09,877
[SPEAKER_03]: As you may recall, we place

406
01:11:10,846 --> 01:11:13,147
[SPEAKER_03]: every year winning bronze, silver, and gold in most categories.

407
01:11:13,307 --> 01:11:15,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Please see the details below regarding the itinerary of events.

408
01:11:16,568 --> 01:11:19,989
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be two students from cosmetology and two students from graphic design.

409
01:11:20,049 --> 01:11:23,410
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm seeking approval of this annual trip for students and advisors.

410
01:11:23,891 --> 01:11:28,452
[SPEAKER_03]: The cost has been paid from our SkillsUSA competition line in our regular operating budget.

411
01:11:29,212 --> 01:11:31,493
[SPEAKER_03]: The field trip starts on Thursday, April 27th at 11am.

412
01:11:34,531 --> 01:11:38,112
[SPEAKER_03]: and concludes on Saturday with an award ceremony at 9.30 a.m.

413
01:11:39,393 --> 01:11:45,415
[SPEAKER_03]: at the Best Western Trade Center, and they will return back to Medford at around 3 p.m.

414
01:11:45,555 --> 01:11:47,315
[SPEAKER_03]: on Saturday, the 29th.

415
01:11:47,355 --> 01:11:49,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to approve.

416
01:11:50,036 --> 01:11:50,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

417
01:11:51,957 --> 01:11:54,278
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion for approval by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Graham.

418
01:11:54,718 --> 01:11:55,478

01:11:55,498 --> 01:11:56,078
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

420
01:11:56,238 --> 01:11:56,879
[SPEAKER_12]: All those opposed?

421
01:11:56,919 --> 01:11:57,659
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion passes.

422
01:11:58,619 --> 01:12:00,660
[SPEAKER_12]: Recommendation to, what'd you say?

423
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:01,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I said thank you.

424
01:12:02,541 --> 01:12:03,221
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Member Graham.

425
01:12:04,778 --> 01:12:13,943
[SPEAKER_12]: Recommendation to approve travel to Spain, Dr. Vilma Bo, coordinator of world language and Dr. Peter Cushing.

426
01:12:14,483 --> 01:12:14,783
[SPEAKER_12]: Welcome.

427
01:12:15,704 --> 01:12:15,964
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

428
01:12:17,468 --> 01:12:19,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much, Madam Mayor, member of the school committee.

429
01:12:20,050 --> 01:12:22,052
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a unique opportunity.

430
01:12:22,633 --> 01:12:42,869
[SPEAKER_05]: This is actually an immersion trip where students will spend about 50% of the time living with a host family in Spain, while then also moving on at the latter half of the trip to more of the tours that you're familiar with, which are, you know, while not necessarily a language immersion trip,

431
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:46,170
[SPEAKER_05]: similar to the one that's going to France next week.

432
01:12:46,271 --> 01:12:52,672
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a specific language immersion trip for students taking Spanish while it will be opened up to other students.

433
01:12:54,312 --> 01:13:02,374
[SPEAKER_05]: It is specifically designed for students to reside with Spanish families and to really get that authentic learning experience.

434
01:13:03,354 --> 01:13:04,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry I'm talking with my hands but

435
01:13:06,331 --> 01:13:08,193
[SPEAKER_05]: We really hope that you'll approve this.

436
01:13:08,393 --> 01:13:11,656
[SPEAKER_05]: We will make sure that all the requisite insurance are there.

437
01:13:11,676 --> 01:13:15,579
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not the same company that we usually use for our trips.

438
01:13:15,740 --> 01:13:18,202
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a different company, but Ms.

439
01:13:18,222 --> 01:13:25,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Bebeau and the other teachers involved in planning this trip have really done their due diligence and it's tremendous opportunity for our students.

440
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:27,150
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

441
01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:30,733
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, Member McLaughlin, then Member Ruseau is your light on.

442
01:13:32,314 --> 01:13:32,895
[SPEAKER_12]: Member McLaughlin.

443
01:13:33,927 --> 01:13:34,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you.

444
01:13:34,768 --> 01:13:43,252
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had a question on I'm assuming you when you said the requisite insurance materials would have you that there will be an option for cancellation or something.

445
01:13:43,392 --> 01:13:54,118
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that, you know, when we had the COVID experience with field trip and trying to get money back and all that don't want to obviously, you know, don't expect another global pandemic but

446
01:13:56,325 --> 01:13:58,226
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, is there an option for cancellation?

447
01:13:58,827 --> 01:14:13,078
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be just, everyone should know that those insurances are not as easy to access for cancellation, but it will be an option pending, you know, global unrest, various things along those lines.

448
01:14:13,098 --> 01:14:13,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

449
01:14:15,279 --> 01:14:15,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau.

450
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:16,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

451
01:14:17,841 --> 01:14:18,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I go?

452
01:14:18,342 --> 01:14:19,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Just kidding.

453
01:14:20,023 --> 01:14:21,284
[SPEAKER_05]: We will be looking for chaperones.

454
01:14:21,384 --> 01:14:23,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

455
01:14:24,366 --> 01:14:24,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways.

456
01:14:25,632 --> 01:14:33,935
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just going to ask that we make sure that the usual travel approval forms come back to us prior to it actually happening.

457
01:14:34,295 --> 01:14:39,998
[SPEAKER_07]: I know this is really kind of early, but we do really want to make sure that that is always filled out.

458
01:14:40,038 --> 01:14:40,718
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

459
01:14:41,118 --> 01:14:43,239
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually working on revamping those forms right now.

460
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:53,063
[SPEAKER_05]: And as a prelude, our language tours, we will also be looking for an Italian tour next year that we'll bring up in the May, at some point in May.

461
01:14:56,687 --> 01:14:57,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Graham.

462
01:14:57,408 --> 01:14:58,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I just ask one more question?

463
01:14:59,169 --> 01:15:13,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Given that students will be staying with families in Spain, is there additional vetting that we've done with the tour operator about the families that our students will stay with?

464
01:15:13,563 --> 01:15:18,127
[SPEAKER_03]: And does that create any sort of additional liability

465
01:15:19,284 --> 01:15:22,305
[SPEAKER_03]: for us to consider as we think about approving this trip.

466
01:15:22,425 --> 01:15:27,446
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have to look into the liability waivers, but there's no additional vetting that the Medford Public Schools will do.

467
01:15:27,946 --> 01:15:37,068
[SPEAKER_05]: The organization does the vetting and we, I mean, there's no international quarry or fingerprint check that we would be able to run.

468
01:15:37,708 --> 01:15:45,589
[SPEAKER_05]: So we go on the basis of the organization who has done these trips successfully for a long time, being able to provide that.

469
01:15:45,649 --> 01:15:48,190
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do understand your concern clearly.

470
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:59,572
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it sounds like you are comfortable with the amount of vetting that happens between the organization that we are signing on with and the families that agree to host our students.

471
01:15:59,832 --> 01:16:00,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

472
01:16:00,432 --> 01:16:13,454
[SPEAKER_05]: And while they're with the families, they're still in contact and with our teachers, chaperones, and other personnel throughout that period of approximately five days.

473
01:16:14,234 --> 01:16:14,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

474
01:16:14,795 --> 01:16:15,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to approve.

475
01:16:15,515 --> 01:16:15,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

476
01:16:16,295 --> 01:16:16,575
[SPEAKER_12]: That's OK.

477
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:17,155
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion to approve.

478
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:37,732
[SPEAKER_12]: for approval by member graham seconded by member mclaughlin all those in favor aye all those opposed motion passes and our fifth presentation is on the process and timeline of tiered focused monitoring and out of district enrollment update miss joan bowen director of student services good evening we saved the best for last i think i'm just kidding

479
01:16:39,691 --> 01:16:46,076
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just, tonight I'm going to walk you through the TAD focused monitoring process that Medford is undergoing this year.

480
01:16:46,516 --> 01:16:48,618
[SPEAKER_08]: We're in our self-assessment phase.

481
01:16:49,619 --> 01:16:56,083
[SPEAKER_08]: This is formerly known as CPI, the Coordinated Program Review, but they've changed the title on it.

482
01:16:56,944 --> 01:16:57,745
[SPEAKER_08]: Next slide, please.

483
01:16:57,765 --> 01:17:00,887
[SPEAKER_08]: It's okay.

484
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:18,574
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically tiered focused monitoring is the review of select policies, procedures, student records, and building facilities to see if schools and districts are in compliance with or following the state and federal laws and regulations for special education and civil rights.

485
01:17:19,474 --> 01:17:27,001
[SPEAKER_08]: The PSM reviews all school districts, charter schools, vocational schools, and virtual schools across the state every three years.

486
01:17:28,208 --> 01:17:30,690
[SPEAKER_08]: So this year we're in our district self assessment.

487
01:17:31,410 --> 01:17:36,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Next year, the activities will include a parent survey and onsite visit with it.

488
01:17:37,775 --> 01:17:44,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Ted focus morning will actually do a record review a document review, they'll interview staff families.

489
01:17:45,692 --> 01:17:47,933
[SPEAKER_08]: And they'll do a facility observation.

490
01:17:48,013 --> 01:17:54,016
[SPEAKER_08]: So this, they want to make sure that all our special education program aren't located in one part of the building.

491
01:17:54,356 --> 01:17:57,938
[SPEAKER_08]: They want to make sure that our students have equal access to all the opportunities.

492
01:17:58,938 --> 01:18:06,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Once that is done, they'll take a look at all of the information that we've provided and do an analysis of it and come up with a report.

493
01:18:06,823 --> 01:18:13,786
[SPEAKER_08]: And if at any time they find that the district is not in compliance, they'll ask us to complete a corrective action plan.

494
01:18:14,266 --> 01:18:30,633
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we were found in non-compliance for meeting timelines, I'd have to do a training with all staff members, teachers, evaluators, administrators, to make sure that they understand that this is the process and this is what needs to be followed.

495
01:18:31,073 --> 01:18:35,875
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we submit that, they accept it, and then we have to have a monitoring process going forward.

496
01:18:36,627 --> 01:18:41,158
[SPEAKER_08]: So the next onsite visit for Medford is during the 23-24 school year.

497
01:18:41,178 --> 01:18:45,367
[SPEAKER_08]: And this just breaks down what the different

498
01:18:47,366 --> 01:18:54,769
[SPEAKER_08]: but the process and the identified elements that they are going to be specifically looking at for Medford.

499
01:18:55,189 --> 01:19:06,874
[SPEAKER_08]: So Medford's in group A, and it's called universal standards, and they address student identification, IEP development, programming and support services, and equal opportunity.

500
01:19:07,934 --> 01:19:21,997
[SPEAKER_08]: In addition to those, the department has reserved a specific set of criteria collectively known as targeted standards employed when the LEA or school level risk assessment data includes that there is a potential issue.

501
01:19:22,737 --> 01:19:28,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Identified targeted standards are assessed in addition to the universal standards.

502
01:19:29,399 --> 01:19:30,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Next slide, please.

503
01:19:30,816 --> 01:19:35,200
[SPEAKER_08]: So the self-assessment, this is what we're deep in right now.

504
01:19:36,061 --> 01:19:43,167
[SPEAKER_08]: We have go through all, we're given the documents that we need to upload to the web-based management system.

505
01:19:44,428 --> 01:19:51,114
[SPEAKER_08]: There's documentation for monitoring all the elements, as well as input of sample student and when appropriate staff records.

506
01:19:51,675 --> 01:19:57,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Upon completion of all the required portions of the self-assessment, it's submitted to the department for review.

507
01:19:59,039 --> 01:20:05,462
[SPEAKER_08]: For Medford, these are the specific indicators and special education and civil rights criterion that were selected.

508
01:20:05,923 --> 01:20:09,264
[SPEAKER_08]: There are three indicators, which I will describe in the next slide.

509
01:20:09,724 --> 01:20:14,487
[SPEAKER_08]: There's 11 special ed criteria, as well as three civil rights criteria.

510
01:20:16,328 --> 01:20:32,772
[SPEAKER_08]: So the indicators there are three that we need to submit the data collection is during an identified period of time that they have given to us so the first one is indicator 11 and that measures timelines for determining initial special special education eligibility.

511
01:20:33,171 --> 01:20:41,020
[SPEAKER_08]: From the moment the parent requests an evaluation to the 45 days when it's completed, we have to make sure that we've met all the requirements.

512
01:20:41,341 --> 01:20:52,794
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have to upload all the students' names, the process we followed, the dates, so they will come with their on-site visit and take a look at our binders to make sure that we actually follow the process.

513
01:20:53,995 --> 01:21:00,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Indicator 12 measures transition from early intervention to special education under IDEA.

514
01:21:01,180 --> 01:21:14,629
[SPEAKER_08]: So this looks at evaluating students at the age of three or prior to three, finding them eligible if they require special education services and making sure that plan is put into place before their third birthday.

515
01:21:15,526 --> 01:21:41,030
[SPEAKER_08]: And then indicator 13 is our percent of youth with IEPs age 14 and above with an IEP that includes measurable post-secondary goals that are annually updated based on age appropriate transition assessment, transition services, courses of study that will all reasonably enable the student to meet those post-secondary goals and annual IEP goals related to their transition service needs.

516
01:21:41,710 --> 01:21:43,931
[SPEAKER_08]: So indicator 11, we were giving the,

517
01:21:45,646 --> 01:21:49,509
[SPEAKER_08]: The timeline of October 1st to December 31st of 2022.

518
01:21:50,390 --> 01:21:53,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Indicator 12 is January 1st to March 31st.

519
01:21:54,413 --> 01:21:58,197
[SPEAKER_08]: And indicator 13 is October 1st to March 31st as well.

520
01:22:00,238 --> 01:22:05,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Next slide is our special education criteria.

521
01:22:05,303 --> 01:22:13,670
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you want more information, I can provide you the detail of what each specific criteria entails.

522
01:22:14,411 --> 01:22:17,413
[SPEAKER_08]: For example, SE26 parent participation.

523
01:22:17,793 --> 01:22:28,680
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to make sure that the parents are involved in when the meeting is scheduled, that they're included on the meeting invitation, and that they have an active part in the IEP process.

524
01:22:30,801 --> 01:22:33,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Next slide is the civil rights criterion.

525
01:22:33,402 --> 01:22:35,964
[SPEAKER_08]: And these three were selected for Medford.

526
01:22:36,444 --> 01:22:41,447
[SPEAKER_08]: The first one is the availability of information of academic counseling and general curriculum.

527
01:22:41,487 --> 01:22:42,468
[SPEAKER_08]: So this means that

528
01:22:43,590 --> 01:22:51,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Students have access all students have access to counseling whether it's guidance counseling whether it's school based school adjustment Councilor.

529
01:22:52,620 --> 01:22:59,167
[SPEAKER_08]: We look at our materials to make sure that they are bias free, and then the responsibilities of the school principal.

530
01:22:59,367 --> 01:23:02,891
[SPEAKER_12]: So for example, yeah, I'm sorry.

531
01:23:05,404 --> 01:23:08,087
[SPEAKER_07]: I just didn't want you to get off of this slide before I ask this question.

532
01:23:08,107 --> 01:23:08,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

533
01:23:08,307 --> 01:23:11,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Because there's no numbers, and I can't tell you where to go.

534
01:23:11,670 --> 01:23:14,493
[SPEAKER_07]: But do you know how the state selects these?

535
01:23:14,553 --> 01:23:15,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there some randomness?

536
01:23:15,714 --> 01:23:18,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Do they have whoever's in charge is in a particular mood?

537
01:23:19,738 --> 01:23:24,863
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know the specific, but I know everyone in Cohort A in Massachusetts is going through this.

538
01:23:25,244 --> 01:23:27,927
[SPEAKER_08]: They have the same criteria selected for them.

539
01:23:28,147 --> 01:23:28,307
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

540
01:23:28,422 --> 01:23:28,722
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

541
01:23:28,822 --> 01:23:29,542
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know.

542
01:23:29,562 --> 01:23:32,564
[SPEAKER_08]: I think every year they rotate through all of them.

543
01:23:32,584 --> 01:23:36,645
[SPEAKER_08]: There's probably 50 something criteria for special education.

544
01:23:36,665 --> 01:23:38,246
[SPEAKER_08]: There's about 30 for civil rights.

545
01:23:38,686 --> 01:23:41,627
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it may be based on PRS complaints.

546
01:23:41,787 --> 01:23:45,188
[SPEAKER_08]: It may be based on things that they're hearing.

547
01:23:45,208 --> 01:23:50,810
[SPEAKER_08]: So they wanna take a deeper dive into it, but every three years and every six years, it's totally different criteria.

548
01:23:51,070 --> 01:23:53,772
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's never just like, this isn't the Medford set of criteria.

549
01:23:53,812 --> 01:23:56,312
[SPEAKER_07]: No, this is all of cohort A, correct.

550
01:23:56,513 --> 01:23:57,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of information.

551
01:23:58,564 --> 01:23:58,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

552
01:23:58,844 --> 01:24:02,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Information member McLaughlin, but the indicators are 15 indicators.

553
01:24:03,185 --> 01:24:04,486
[SPEAKER_12]: No, there's yes, there is 15.

554
01:24:04,986 --> 01:24:06,226
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's 15 indicators.

555
01:24:06,326 --> 01:24:13,508
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the school committee is interested and wants to know what the 15 indicators are, I can, I can provide you could send us the 15 indicators.

556
01:24:13,608 --> 01:24:21,390
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they randomize, I would assume they ran my, or maybe based on PRS, but I would assume they randomize the indicators anyway that they pick.

557
01:24:21,450 --> 01:24:24,351
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, one cohort gets some in the other gets the other.

558
01:24:24,875 --> 01:24:31,721
[SPEAKER_02]: But the indicators are important to know because it's really sort of how we're being judged on special education across the state.

559
01:24:31,821 --> 01:24:35,684
[SPEAKER_02]: So I encourage the school committee, if we can get a copy of them, that would be great.

560
01:24:35,704 --> 01:24:36,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

561
01:24:36,204 --> 01:24:39,667
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually went through a training at the beginning of the year and they broke everything down.

562
01:24:39,707 --> 01:24:43,450
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can forward that to you and share it with you just so you have a better understanding.

563
01:24:43,470 --> 01:24:44,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's good to know.

564
01:24:44,091 --> 01:24:50,396
[SPEAKER_02]: I was the co-chair of the Special Ed Advisory Council and even the Special Ed Advisory Council at the state level didn't have the 15 indicators.

565
01:24:50,416 --> 01:24:51,016
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was crazy.

566
01:24:51,537 --> 01:24:52,338
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's good to know them.

567
01:24:52,358 --> 01:24:52,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

568
01:24:54,287 --> 01:25:00,472
[SPEAKER_08]: And the next slide is, so this was, this is our activities and timeline.

569
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:03,254
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've already, I attended the training.

570
01:25:03,514 --> 01:25:07,537
[SPEAKER_08]: I also had several other special education coordinators attend as well.

571
01:25:08,298 --> 01:25:11,860
[SPEAKER_08]: I want them to have more responsibility for their particular area.

572
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:18,465
[SPEAKER_08]: So Julie Santos was with me and Kim Clinton was the high school and middle school.

573
01:25:19,526 --> 01:25:23,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we, I met with staff to review the process of timeline.

574
01:25:23,792 --> 01:25:29,840
[SPEAKER_08]: I came up with the whole schedule of when I want the documents collected I reached out to principals.

575
01:25:30,644 --> 01:25:35,286
[SPEAKER_08]: curriculum directors, everyone that's involved in getting the documents to me.

576
01:25:36,247 --> 01:25:37,567
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was in January.

577
01:25:37,907 --> 01:25:41,629
[SPEAKER_08]: They have been providing me with the documents last month and this month.

578
01:25:41,729 --> 01:25:43,850
[SPEAKER_08]: My deadline for everyone is April 30th.

579
01:25:44,350 --> 01:25:50,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Although I do have much of it together so I can start uploading it to the portal during vacation week.

580
01:25:51,593 --> 01:25:55,615
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the last slide is just what happens next.

581
01:25:55,695 --> 01:25:57,096
[SPEAKER_08]: So once it's uploaded to,

582
01:25:57,984 --> 01:26:19,590
[SPEAKER_08]: the security portal, that's our self-assessment, then PRS or TF Focus Monitoring will do a desk review, they'll look at all the documents, they'll ask for, they may say we met this criteria, we have enough documentation, or they may call me or email me and ask me for additional documents to support

583
01:26:20,350 --> 01:26:21,010
[SPEAKER_08]: our statement.

584
01:26:21,690 --> 01:26:25,831
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they will come out next school year, 2023, 24.

585
01:26:26,471 --> 01:26:39,794
[SPEAKER_08]: And after that, like I said, they give us a report, we get to respond to it, and then we get a program approval saying that we've met everything that we need to do, and then we can go ahead until three years from now, and we start this process all over again.

586
01:26:40,954 --> 01:26:48,236
[SPEAKER_08]: And I did provide you with the link that will give you much of the information in regards to TA focus monitoring.

587
01:26:49,963 --> 01:26:50,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone have any?

588
01:26:50,663 --> 01:26:51,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Member McLaughlin.

589
01:26:53,284 --> 01:27:02,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I also, so I know you present to the committee when the CPR, Tiered Focus Monitoring, just when you get to know the names, they change them.

590
01:27:02,125 --> 01:27:02,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

591
01:27:04,526 --> 01:27:13,627
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm assuming, or actually, can you share what the Special Education Parent Advisory Council involvement is with the Tiered Focus Monitoring?

592
01:27:13,708 --> 01:27:15,608
[SPEAKER_02]: So they'll probably be selected,

593
01:27:20,540 --> 01:27:23,723
[SPEAKER_08]: We had several CPAC members that were part of the interview process.

594
01:27:23,763 --> 01:27:28,167
[SPEAKER_08]: So they interviewed, I think, each one for about 30 minutes long, questions, that sort of thing.

595
01:27:28,748 --> 01:27:30,169
[SPEAKER_08]: They may reach out to school committee.

596
01:27:30,189 --> 01:27:35,374
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure how, but we'll get a list of participants that they would like to interview.

597
01:27:35,394 --> 01:27:36,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

598
01:27:38,117 --> 01:27:38,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor?

599
01:27:39,238 --> 01:27:39,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Ruseau?

600
01:27:40,919 --> 01:27:42,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you send us this slide deck?

601
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:42,961
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think we have it.

602
01:27:43,101 --> 01:27:43,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

603
01:27:43,742 --> 01:27:43,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

604
01:27:43,902 --> 01:27:44,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

605
01:27:44,302 --> 01:27:45,003
[SPEAKER_08]: I could do that for you.

606
01:27:46,448 --> 01:27:50,209
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the last part is the out-of-district enrollment.

607
01:27:50,269 --> 01:27:51,710
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to provide an update.

608
01:27:52,630 --> 01:28:02,554
[SPEAKER_08]: So I did provide school committee in your packet, just an update of the process of how students are placed in out-of-district programming and why they require it.

609
01:28:03,034 --> 01:28:04,274
[SPEAKER_08]: But I did want to show you.

610
01:28:08,576 --> 01:28:09,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of information there.

611
01:28:10,016 --> 01:28:10,416
[SPEAKER_12]: Question.

612
01:28:10,636 --> 01:28:12,057
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, I'm saying your point of information.

613
01:28:12,317 --> 01:28:12,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

614
01:28:13,297 --> 01:28:16,320
[SPEAKER_02]: In our packet is a list of how they're.

615
01:28:16,721 --> 01:28:21,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, this is the narrative right before this is a narrative I gave you and I just have two slides here.

616
01:28:21,666 --> 01:28:24,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I didn't know if there was something in addition that you're referencing.

617
01:28:24,069 --> 01:28:24,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

618
01:28:26,912 --> 01:28:28,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter, can you put up the next slide please.

619
01:28:29,295 --> 01:28:30,256
[SPEAKER_08]: So just currently.

620
01:28:31,755 --> 01:28:47,732
[SPEAKER_08]: met for public schools has 40 students enrolled in out of district programming in September, we did start out at 35 we did have several students on waiting list due to coven staffing issues, so we were able to finally place several students in out of district programming.

621
01:28:50,177 --> 01:28:55,618
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just provided you a list of the current placements that our students attend.

622
01:28:56,319 --> 01:29:09,502
[SPEAKER_08]: There are only 26 listed, but we do have students, we do have multiple students at some of the programs and those have a star on them that there may be two or three students that currently attend those programs.

623
01:29:16,383 --> 01:29:18,424
[SPEAKER_09]: My apologies, I was reading the slide.

624
01:29:19,683 --> 01:29:20,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Member McLaughlin.

625
01:29:20,924 --> 01:29:21,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

626
01:29:21,985 --> 01:29:22,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for this Ms.

627
01:29:22,765 --> 01:29:23,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Bowen.

628
01:29:24,247 --> 01:29:25,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a few questions.

629
01:29:25,148 --> 01:29:35,336
[SPEAKER_02]: One is for the, I know that Medford staff attend IEP meetings for out of district students.

630
01:29:35,376 --> 01:29:46,146
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm curious, I know that students are entitled to a general education teacher and, or as you were saying, Councilor, you know, they have access to guidance Councilors, whatever.

631
01:29:46,941 --> 01:29:47,742
[SPEAKER_02]: to attend the meeting.

632
01:29:47,762 --> 01:29:50,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know if that happens with the out-of-district placements?

633
01:29:50,804 --> 01:29:53,025
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a little different with out-of-district placements.

634
01:29:53,206 --> 01:30:01,331
[SPEAKER_08]: We can have a general education person there, but it's not required for out-of-district because they're not accessing any general ed curriculum.

635
01:30:02,212 --> 01:30:06,134
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have, our responsibility is to have a school representative there.

636
01:30:06,214 --> 01:30:12,459
[SPEAKER_08]: So the evaluation team leader who chairs the meeting is there as that representative for Medford Public Schools.

637
01:30:13,039 --> 01:30:13,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

638
01:30:13,659 --> 01:30:15,961
[SPEAKER_02]: So just for clarification though, when you say they're not,

639
01:30:16,465 --> 01:30:18,646
[SPEAKER_02]: at accessing general education curriculum?

640
01:30:18,666 --> 01:30:19,507
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean?

641
01:30:19,727 --> 01:30:26,711
[SPEAKER_08]: So they are in the most restrictive setting in and out of district placement.

642
01:30:26,771 --> 01:30:30,853
[SPEAKER_08]: So they are in all specialized small group classrooms.

643
01:30:30,973 --> 01:30:40,319
[SPEAKER_08]: So a student in the district, if they may have a combination of a small group setting, they don't go to electives with the general ed students.

644
01:30:40,879 --> 01:30:45,702
[SPEAKER_08]: All their services, academics, electives are with the cohort of students that they're in.

645
01:30:46,454 --> 01:30:51,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and then can I just ask you so for these districts and for two questions.

646
01:30:51,877 --> 01:30:56,519
[SPEAKER_02]: One is for 40 out of the, you know, roughly 4000 students, right.

647
01:30:56,539 --> 01:30:59,540
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's 10% of students out of district, right?

648
01:30:59,820 --> 01:31:00,761
[SPEAKER_02]: No, 1%.

649
01:31:01,441 --> 01:31:01,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

650
01:31:02,062 --> 01:31:03,442
[SPEAKER_02]: I was losing my zero.

651
01:31:03,462 --> 01:31:04,703
[SPEAKER_02]: 1% is you're like, right.

652
01:31:04,863 --> 01:31:06,944
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, you and I both went to class together.

653
01:31:06,964 --> 01:31:07,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

654
01:31:08,860 --> 01:31:15,025
[SPEAKER_02]: So 1% of students out of district, is that comparable, would you say, to districts similar to ours in terms of the number?

655
01:31:15,125 --> 01:31:16,046
[SPEAKER_08]: It is.

656
01:31:16,866 --> 01:31:24,452
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm in constant communication with all directors in Massachusetts, and there are several that have way more than us.

657
01:31:24,552 --> 01:31:31,677
[SPEAKER_08]: And you could see when the circuit breaker funding comes out, you can see districts in the area, how many students that they do.

658
01:31:31,877 --> 01:31:35,960
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Medford does a really great job of having programs

659
01:31:36,829 --> 01:31:40,711
[SPEAKER_08]: located within the district, like our program for students with autism.

660
01:31:41,211 --> 01:31:46,813
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of districts don't have that type of programming, so they need to place students in an out-of-district program.

661
01:31:47,834 --> 01:31:48,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

662
01:31:48,494 --> 01:32:05,821
[SPEAKER_02]: And then out-of-district families are advised and district professionals are advised that all out-of-district students are assigned a Medford public school building or a Medford public school and have access to the activities and life of that school.

663
01:32:06,443 --> 01:32:06,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

664
01:32:07,365 --> 01:32:19,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Any extracurricular activities the principal should be notified, notifying the parents, they participate students sometimes come to the unified sports program that we run.

665
01:32:20,271 --> 01:32:23,833
[SPEAKER_08]: any extracurricular activities, they are more than welcome to join us.

666
01:32:23,974 --> 01:32:27,476
[SPEAKER_08]: And we want to look at what sort of support that they may require too.

667
01:32:27,516 --> 01:32:41,765
[SPEAKER_08]: So if they need the assistance of a paraprofessional or additional support person, we want to make sure that they're ready to be, you know, welcome in the program and also be successful and have, you know, enjoy it and get the best out of it.

668
01:32:41,985 --> 01:32:43,126
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you know, thank you.

669
01:32:43,166 --> 01:32:43,926
[SPEAKER_02]: And then last question.

670
01:32:43,946 --> 01:32:49,430
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you know if the families who end up with their children are not in district placements, are they,

671
01:32:50,484 --> 01:32:54,386
[SPEAKER_02]: advised of that nature that they have a school assignment.

672
01:32:54,627 --> 01:32:57,908
[SPEAKER_08]: So that would be the evaluation team leader would explain that to them, yes.

673
01:32:57,968 --> 01:33:00,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, because they have school brains, they still have all those things.

674
01:33:00,670 --> 01:33:01,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

675
01:33:02,031 --> 01:33:06,874
[SPEAKER_08]: And sometimes we set the student up with an email address, a Medford email address as well.

676
01:33:07,674 --> 01:33:08,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

677
01:33:08,295 --> 01:33:08,875
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.

678
01:33:09,775 --> 01:33:11,076
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much for the presentation.

679
01:33:11,917 --> 01:33:12,297
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

680
01:33:13,558 --> 01:33:13,738
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.

681
01:33:14,858 --> 01:33:15,639
[SPEAKER_12]: Nope, it was perfect.

682
01:33:16,580 --> 01:33:21,081
[SPEAKER_12]: Presentations of the public, we do not have any presentations of the public or continued business.

683
01:33:21,201 --> 01:33:23,542
[SPEAKER_12]: We do have two items under new business.

684
01:33:23,902 --> 01:33:28,043
[SPEAKER_12]: First, 2023-06 offered by member Hays and member McLaughlin.

685
01:33:28,983 --> 01:33:37,145
[SPEAKER_12]: Whereas the Met for Public Schools is committed to understanding the needs of our diverse population and supporting the academic, social, emotional, physical needs of our students.

686
01:33:38,125 --> 01:33:43,987
[SPEAKER_12]: Whereas the Trevor's Project 2022 National Survey on LGBTQ plus youth mental health found

687
01:33:44,497 --> 01:34:01,363
[SPEAKER_12]: that 45% of LGBTQ plus youth ages 13 to 24 seriously considered attempted suicide in the previous year, and 14% of LGBTQ youth and nearly 20% of transgender and non-binary youth actually attempted suicide.

688
01:34:02,543 --> 01:34:13,947
[SPEAKER_12]: Whereas the 2019 Massachusetts Youth Risk Behavior Survey found that compared with heterosexual side gender youth, LGBTQ plus youth were twice as likely to be bullied at school

689
01:34:14,710 --> 01:34:20,052
[SPEAKER_12]: four times more likely to attempt suicide and significantly more likely to skip school because they felt unsafe.

690
01:34:20,852 --> 01:34:31,235
[SPEAKER_12]: Whereas the Trevor Project found that LGBTQ plus youth who found their school to be LGBTQ plus affirming reported lower rates of attempting suicide.

691
01:34:31,715 --> 01:34:42,118
[SPEAKER_12]: And the 2019 Massachusetts Youth Risk Behavior Survey found that social support from adults is associated with lower risk among LGBTQ plus youth for adverse experiences

692
01:34:42,674 --> 01:35:09,244
[SPEAKER_12]: such as skipping school, being bullied at school, being bullied electronically, considering suicide and attempting suicide, be it resolved that the Subcommittee on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion meet to review guidance on policies and supports for LGBTQ plus students from the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, the Massachusetts Commission on LGBTQ Youth, the Trevor Project, the NGLSEN,

693
01:35:10,236 --> 01:35:16,143
[SPEAKER_12]: as well as policies and supports implemented in surrounding school districts to consider policies to recommend to the entire committee.

694
01:35:16,703 --> 01:35:21,128
[SPEAKER_12]: Dates submitted March 30th, 2023 for this week's agenda.

695
01:35:21,649 --> 01:35:22,670
[SPEAKER_12]: Pass it off to Member Hays.

696
01:35:24,343 --> 01:35:24,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

697
01:35:24,763 --> 01:35:46,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, I think we know that, especially recently, there have been a number of attacks on the rights and protections for LGBTQ people in general and also especially our LGBT youth to youth in schools, and especially our transgender and non binary students.

698
01:35:49,517 --> 01:36:11,124
