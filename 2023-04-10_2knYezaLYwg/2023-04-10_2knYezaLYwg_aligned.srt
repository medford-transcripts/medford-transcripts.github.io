1
00:01:02,287 --> 00:01:11,509
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

2
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:12,169
Thank you.

3
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:14,330
Is there a motion to go into executive session?

4
00:01:17,031 --> 00:01:18,191
Seconded by member Graham.

5
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:19,091
All those in favor?

00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:19,891

10
00:01:28,753 --> 00:01:29,013

Yes.

21
00:01:42,411 --> 00:01:42,992
Member McStone.

22
00:01:43,212 --> 00:01:43,332
Yes.

23
00:01:43,632 --> 00:01:44,133
Member Rousseau.

00:01:44,273 --> 00:01:44,473
Yes.

25
00:01:44,574 --> 00:01:45,234
Mayor Longo Kern.

26
00:01:45,555 --> 00:01:45,775
Yes.

27
00:01:45,795 --> 00:01:47,397
70 affirmative, 0 in the negative.

28
00:01:47,717 --> 00:01:48,578
Move to executive session.

29
00:03:12,944 --> 00:03:13,885
Is that your phone, Peter?

30
00:03:14,765 --> 00:03:15,446
Yeah, it's mine.

31
00:03:15,466 --> 00:03:16,006
You good?

32
00:03:16,387 --> 00:03:18,388
Yeah, it hurts.

33
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:20,190
Is it an iPhone?

34
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,512
No, it's a broken Samsung.

35
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:05,584
Thank you.

36
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:35,729
You You

37
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:51,132
Bye.

38
00:06:23,702 --> 00:06:23,827
Yeah.

39
00:07:13,353 --> 00:07:13,476
Thanks.

40
00:08:26,118 --> 00:08:26,182
you

41
00:09:19,411 --> 00:09:19,551
You You

you you

45
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:51,761
Okay.

46
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:28,920
You You

47
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:46,331
You

48
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:02,191
you

49
00:26:49,616 --> 00:26:49,756
You You

50
00:28:22,969 --> 00:28:23,159
Thank you.

51
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,218
Thank you.

52
00:31:21,852 --> 00:31:21,920
you

53
00:33:05,674 --> 00:33:05,854
Thank you.

54
00:35:24,224 --> 00:35:24,364
You You

55
00:36:14,309 --> 00:36:14,372
you

56
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:39,923
you

57
00:38:17,924 --> 00:38:18,825
So it's really nice.

58
00:38:20,528 --> 00:38:23,552
Oh my gosh.

59
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:27,357
I know it's very gorgeous, but yes.

60
00:38:27,377 --> 00:38:29,660
That was wonderful.

61
00:39:17,978 --> 00:39:19,799
She's got to spread her wings.

62
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:54,541
We're excited about the big lottery.

63
00:40:32,076 --> 00:40:42,780
Bills and payrolls, minutes from the committee of the whole budget, FY 24 meeting held April 3rd and minutes from the sixth regular school committee meeting held April 3rd.

64
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:43,640
Member Graham?

65
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:44,201
Yes.

66
00:40:45,481 --> 00:40:48,162
I have an issue with the minutes from the last meeting.

67
00:40:49,577 --> 00:40:50,577
Motion to sever.

68
00:40:50,977 --> 00:40:52,658
Motion to sever by Member McLaughlin.

69
00:40:55,718 --> 00:40:57,038
Seconded by Member McStone.

70
00:40:57,278 --> 00:40:57,919
All those in favor?

71
00:40:57,939 --> 00:40:58,259
Aye.

72
00:40:58,399 --> 00:41:01,099
Okay, Member McLaughlin.

73
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:12,001
So for the minutes from the last meeting, just on the last page, it just says, when we were talking with Ms.

74
00:41:12,021 --> 00:41:16,962
Fidler-Carey about the before school and after school program,

75
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:20,401
And she was mentioning that there would be wraparound paraprofessionals.

76
00:41:20,441 --> 00:41:24,823
And I had asked if that would open more opportunities for students with disabilities.

77
00:41:24,863 --> 00:41:33,749
And she said, she believed it would, but in the, let's see, halfway up, it says member McLaughlin follows up and is asking slash looking for confirmation.

78
00:41:34,549 --> 00:41:39,412
If not opening it up to students with disabilities, they have access to the programming regardless.

79
00:41:39,492 --> 00:41:45,416
And I just want to clarify that I'm not, I was not asking or looking for confirmation.

80
00:41:45,956 --> 00:41:46,677
I was stating,

81
00:41:47,236 --> 00:41:57,126
that students with disabilities have access to before and after school programming, regardless of wraparound services and wraparound paraprofessionals.

82
00:41:57,146 --> 00:41:59,008
So I'm just asking for that clarification.

83
00:41:59,929 --> 00:42:00,690
Do I need to make a motion?

84
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:02,212
Is there a motion to approve as amended?

85
00:42:02,612 --> 00:42:03,673
Motion to approve as amended.

86
00:42:04,013 --> 00:42:04,334
Second.

87
00:42:05,285 --> 00:42:14,588
Okay, motion to approve the April 3rd regular school committee meeting minutes as amended by member Rousseau, seconded by member McLaughlin.

88
00:42:14,988 --> 00:42:15,789
All those in favor?

89
00:42:15,809 --> 00:42:16,109
Aye.

90
00:42:16,529 --> 00:42:16,649
Aye.

91
00:42:16,989 --> 00:42:17,649
All those opposed?

92
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:22,991
Okay, I think we still have a need proof.

93
00:42:23,271 --> 00:42:29,513
Yep, motion to approve the consent agenda, which includes bills and payrolls and the committee of the whole budget meeting held on April 3rd.

94
00:42:30,053 --> 00:42:34,075
Motion to approve by member McLaughlin, seconded by member Rousseau.

95
00:42:35,046 --> 00:42:35,706
All those in favor?

96
00:42:35,726 --> 00:42:36,547
Aye.

97
00:42:36,767 --> 00:42:37,447
All those opposed?

98
00:42:38,348 --> 00:42:38,928
Motion passes.

99
00:42:41,089 --> 00:42:42,970
Item number four, report of subcommittees.

100
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:49,312
We have the minutes of the rules and policy subcommittee held on March 28th, 2023.

101
00:42:49,393 --> 00:42:49,973
Member Russo?

102
00:42:51,594 --> 00:42:51,914
Thank you.

103
00:42:52,614 --> 00:42:55,956
I have too many windows open.

104
00:42:56,016 --> 00:42:56,836
Sorry, one moment.

105
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:04,892
Thank you.

106
00:43:05,272 --> 00:43:07,033
Great.

107
00:43:08,034 --> 00:43:08,614
Yes, thank you.

108
00:43:08,654 --> 00:43:16,778
So we met on April 3 2023 to continue discussions on the bullying prevention and intervention plan.

109
00:43:17,798 --> 00:43:24,161
Our agenda was a little off kilter because we were hoping our attorney would be with us but

110
00:43:25,175 --> 00:43:26,697
That was not an option that night.

111
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:37,326
So we discussed how to proceed with the document and at the next meeting, which will be on the 28th, I believe.

112
00:43:38,728 --> 00:43:40,009
One moment, I do have that right here.

113
00:43:40,029 --> 00:43:46,935
No, the, okay, 26th, 25th.

114
00:43:50,982 --> 00:43:53,803
I don't have it in my calendar, even though I know I put it in my calendar.

115
00:43:53,823 --> 00:43:54,423
So forgive me.

116
00:43:54,863 --> 00:44:17,430
At our next meeting, which is coming up this month, the end of the month, we will be working with our attorney to go through all of the recommendations that he had, as well as bringing forth a proposed new document and new format, rather than trying to work through the 38 pages one line at a time.

117
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:22,222
We had a lot of great conversation that the minutes explain.

118
00:44:23,022 --> 00:44:33,947
I'm hoping that the next meeting is either the last or second to the last meeting on this plan, and that we'll be able to make enough progress to get this buttoned up before the end of the school year.

119
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:38,449
And just as a point of clarification, the meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, April 25th.

120
00:44:38,549 --> 00:44:41,290
Is there a motion to approve the minutes?

121
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:42,510
Motion to approve.

122
00:44:43,011 --> 00:44:45,752
Motion to approve the minutes by Member McLaughlin, seconded by?

123
00:44:47,076 --> 00:44:48,457
Member Hayes, all those in favor?

124
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:50,279
All those opposed?

125
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:51,961
Motion passes.

126
00:44:56,145 --> 00:44:58,467
Item number five, the report of the superintendent.

127
00:44:59,188 --> 00:45:01,270
Updates and comments, Dr. Edward-Vinson.

128
00:45:02,271 --> 00:45:03,152
Hey, good evening.

129
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:10,980
I hope that everyone had a joyful Easter and Passover gatherings this past weekend.

130
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:27,479
I just wanted to inform the committee that last week, our AI are completed their Jesse completed their visit with Medford public schools that approximately 100 classrooms.

131
00:45:30,121 --> 00:45:36,206
were observed, they conducted countless interviews of administrators, school committee members.

132
00:45:36,906 --> 00:45:47,495
And so we look forward to getting that report back and learning from what Dessy has to share with us from the district.

133
00:45:47,956 --> 00:45:52,840
And this special review takes place about once every 10 years or so.

134
00:45:53,420 --> 00:46:02,167
So I'm hoping and looking forward to the results of all of the work that they did, our review.

135
00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:19,921
I would like to thank Professor Regina Millen from the University, from UMass Lowell, UMass Lowell's Graphic Design and Illustration program, who came to speak to both our art students and our graphic design students.

136
00:46:20,801 --> 00:46:31,803
She did talk about the UMass Laurel program and spoke about different career paths that are available to our students in the graphic and design and illustration fields.

137
00:46:32,584 --> 00:46:43,666
Similar to the women in the construction, electrical, robotics, and welding fields, as well as the women leaders who spoke to students to celebrate Women's History Month.

138
00:46:44,106 --> 00:46:48,867
So these speakers present real life future options for all of our students.

139
00:46:50,729 --> 00:46:58,759
I also want to talk about our one of our vocational programs which is working collaboratively with the Medford family network.

140
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:06,928
Some of our graphic design students have been working very very diligently on designing.

141
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:16,472
with special permission from the authors, they have scanned and taken books, 10 books in total.

142
00:47:17,192 --> 00:47:23,034
And this project involves students using a special machine where they print the books.

143
00:47:23,934 --> 00:47:25,475
They use Adobe Illustrator.

144
00:47:26,055 --> 00:47:28,315
The special machine is a Roland 54 inch VersaCam.

145
00:47:30,816 --> 00:47:34,299
and they laminate the books and they add granites.

146
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:42,665
And these books are going to be posted to fences in some of the parks throughout Medford.

147
00:47:43,166 --> 00:47:52,693
So it's wonderful to see our students working collaboratively with the Medford Family Network and making a difference in our community.

148
00:47:53,273 --> 00:47:56,436
So we're very excited and happy about the work that they're doing there.

149
00:47:57,276 --> 00:48:06,459
I also want to recognize our Mustang marching band, because they will be traveling to Florida.

150
00:48:06,739 --> 00:48:12,440
Yes, yes to Disney Springs at Walt Disney World next week so they're leaving on Saturday, and.

151
00:48:14,501 --> 00:48:16,903
Oh, thank you, Member McStone.

152
00:48:17,803 --> 00:48:25,609
They leave on Wednesday, and on Saturday, April 15th at 1230, I believe that's their performance.

153
00:48:25,889 --> 00:48:27,550
So that's their big performance.

154
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:31,112
And this is the group of students that are going by train.

155
00:48:31,192 --> 00:48:33,474
So we talk about trains, planes, and automobiles.

156
00:48:34,755 --> 00:48:43,961
We look forward to them performing well and coming back to maybe share with us a highlight or two about the adventure on their way down to Disney.

157
00:48:44,661 --> 00:48:49,623
So we are going to be cheering for our Medford Mustang marching band.

158
00:48:49,683 --> 00:48:50,443
Congratulations.

159
00:48:50,483 --> 00:48:51,644
We wish you the best of luck.

160
00:48:52,404 --> 00:48:58,286
I also want to congratulate Kyla Magris and Allison Waldron from the Brooks School.

161
00:48:58,766 --> 00:49:11,271
They are fifth grade students working with CC, they are fifth grade CCSR leaders, and they organized a school-wide coin challenge to benefit the American Cancer Society.

162
00:49:11,631 --> 00:49:13,432
They asked students to bring in coins.

163
00:49:13,972 --> 00:49:20,155
And the pennies and nickels quickly quickly multiplied, and they raised a total of $1400.

164
00:49:21,555 --> 00:49:35,201
So I want to say great job and congratulations to both Kyla and Allison and thank you to the book school for donating that funding to the American Cancer Society, you did a wonderful job.

165
00:49:36,201 --> 00:49:42,425
Also last week, right before our long weekend, sold out crowd at the high school.

166
00:49:42,785 --> 00:49:45,247
The Wizards, the Harlem Wizards came to play.

167
00:49:45,787 --> 00:49:48,348
It was a fundraiser for Medford Public Schools.

168
00:49:49,089 --> 00:49:51,570
All of the elementary PTOs collaborated.

169
00:49:52,031 --> 00:50:02,317
So it was wonderful seeing the high school auditorium jam-packed with kids, with families, basketball competitions, teachers,

170
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:14,125
administrators, students, they got to compete and play and it was a wonderful time and I truly hope that it was a fabulous fundraiser for all of our PTOs.

171
00:50:15,806 --> 00:50:26,014
I also want to thank our Medford Cultural Council for providing funding for the following projects at the Medford Public Schools.

172
00:50:26,634 --> 00:50:35,160

00:56:14,481 --> 00:56:15,802
We're almost at the end of the line.

00:56:15,842 --> 00:56:16,822

229
00:57:49,780 --> 00:58:06,574
The Day of Silence is when LGBTQ plus students and allies all around the country and the world take a vow of silence to protest the harmful effects of harassment and discrimination of LGBTQ plus students in schools.

230
00:58:07,555 --> 00:58:18,679
This is expanded to reach hundreds of thousands of students each year, and students share their experiences to bring attention to ways their schools and communities can become more inclusive.

231
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,060
Those are my announcements for this evening.

232
00:58:23,421 --> 00:58:24,241
Thank you so much.

233
00:58:25,041 --> 00:58:26,282
Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

234
00:58:26,302 --> 00:58:28,343
It's a busy, busy April.

235
00:58:28,503 --> 00:58:29,143
Busy, busy.

236
00:58:29,563 --> 00:58:30,103
Oh, good, thanks.

237
00:58:33,204 --> 00:58:34,005
And then June, yep.

238
00:58:35,737 --> 00:58:44,977
Number two, we have Andrews Middle School and McGlynn Middle School presentations by Mr. Michael Downs, principal of the Andrews, and Mr. Nicholas Tucci, principal of McGlynn.

239
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:45,719
Welcome.

240
00:58:52,196 --> 00:59:08,506
Good evening and welcome everybody, thank you for giving us this opportunity to speak a little bit about the transition of many of our Medford public school students from fifth grade to sixth grade and certainly I wanna welcome all those come on Wednesday, when they get selected for the McGlynn middle school.

241
00:59:08,996 --> 00:59:15,017
and I can't wait to be their principal as their sixth grade and middle school year kind of commences, years commence.

242
00:59:15,077 --> 00:59:35,981
So today I'm just going to spend a little bit of time giving you all an opportunity to hear a little bit about the presentation that I know you have in front of you that students and families are going to get when they arrive at the McGlynn Middle School on Tuesday, May 2nd, which is the day of the sixth grade open house for students that are going to be coming to the McGlynn Middle School.

243
00:59:36,829 --> 00:59:43,595
So when students arrive at our school on Tuesday, May 2nd, they're going to be funneled into our auditorium.

244
00:59:44,056 --> 00:59:49,901
And from there, we're going to deliver an opening presentation led by myself and my assistant principal, Mr. John Bruno.

245
00:59:49,921 --> 01:00:02,493
And we're gonna have a couple of special speakers, a student who is going to be speaking a little bit about their experiences and sharing some reflections as to how to find success transitioning from elementary to middle school.

246
01:00:03,459 --> 01:00:06,719
After our presentation that we're going to deliver in the auditorium.

247
01:00:07,432 --> 01:00:17,901
students are gonna go to the best part of the open house experience where they'll do a scavenger hunt that'll be led by a sixth grade teacher and also a student ambassador.

248
01:00:18,361 --> 01:00:24,687
And they're going to engage in this opportunity to hunt throughout the school and try to visit a number of different stops.

249
01:00:25,428 --> 01:00:31,072
And including your package, you can see stops like they'll go into a sample art classroom or a Spanish classroom.

250
01:00:31,413 --> 01:00:33,755
They'll have an opportunity to go to our curriculum fair.

251
01:00:34,635 --> 01:00:41,620
where they'll learn about the different offerings that we have from our curriculum standpoint, English language arts and science and math and social studies.

252
01:00:42,621 --> 01:00:52,527
Then they'll have an opportunity to visit our club and activities fair, which is one of our biggest tips for how you can find success transition from elementary and middle school is to join a club, get involved in the life of the school.

253
01:00:53,027 --> 01:00:56,930
And we're going to give them a little taste of what some of those offerings are going to be like.

254
01:00:57,866 --> 01:01:06,230
In between some of their stops, they'll go by a performance by Mrs. Chang's wonderful strings ensemble or the wonderful band that we have.

255
01:01:06,350 --> 01:01:12,673
So they'll be kind of greeted as they arrive in the school and make their way from stop to stop with some wonderful musical performances.

256
01:01:13,473 --> 01:01:21,657
And over the course of this opportunity, they're going to have the chance to interact with classmates, teachers, and certainly

257
01:01:22,856 --> 01:01:28,171
you know, some of our student ambassadors that will be kind of like answering their questions and getting them from stop to stop.

258
01:01:29,079 --> 01:01:38,745
And it is our hope at the end of the evening presentation, students and families will be welcomed back into the cafeteria for a little bit of slush and opportunity to socialize and ask further questions.

259
01:01:39,205 --> 01:01:45,609
And we really want to give them every opportunity to make a really good transition into a welcoming, awesome school environment.

260
01:01:46,509 --> 01:01:54,294
So from my standpoint, while this week is filled with preparations for, you know, having a really solid week before April vacation,

261
01:01:54,694 --> 01:02:01,880
We have MCAS testing this week for English Language Arts on Tuesday and Thursday, and we're wishing our families and students a wonderful MCAS season.

262
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:14,170
We want to also welcome on board our incoming class, and I really can't wait to get to know them and give them every opportunity to feel comfortable making this important transition in their educational career.

263
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:18,173
And like I do every year, I want to just put it out there to the community that

264
01:02:19,699 --> 01:02:27,164
Over the summertime, I'm gonna have office hours where I'll be able to invite families to come in and they can sign up to come in and meet with me or just drop by.

265
01:02:27,684 --> 01:02:38,151
I plan to have office hours where I'll be out in the schoolyard shooting hoops and just inviting people to come on by and shoot hoops to the principal and get to know me and learn a little bit about what the middle school experience is going to be like.

266
01:02:38,651 --> 01:02:46,396
So every opportunity that we have to help our students and families make this transition to middle school, this is what we're all about and interested in doing at this point in time.

267
01:02:47,293 --> 01:02:49,154
And thank you all for your time.

268
01:02:49,174 --> 01:02:51,956
And if you have any questions for me, I'm happy to take them right now.

269
01:02:53,837 --> 01:02:56,118
If not, I'll turn it over to Principal Downs too as well.

270
01:02:57,299 --> 01:02:57,619
Thank you.

271
01:02:58,219 --> 01:02:58,979
I've been through that.

272
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:02,001
Open house, Mr. Tucci, it's wonderful.

273
01:03:02,081 --> 01:03:03,462
So keep up the good work.

274
01:03:03,802 --> 01:03:04,723
Mr. Downs, welcome.

275
01:03:05,043 --> 01:03:05,403
Welcome.

276
01:03:05,923 --> 01:03:06,203
Welcome.

277
01:03:06,584 --> 01:03:07,084
Sorry about that.

278
01:03:08,123 --> 01:03:08,843
Good evening, everyone.

279
01:03:08,943 --> 01:03:10,304
I'm not texting or anything.

280
01:03:10,324 --> 01:03:12,864
I forgot to bring my MacBook.

281
01:03:12,884 --> 01:03:15,285
So I'm cheating off my phone and I can't see that far.

282
01:03:15,345 --> 01:03:16,726
So I can't see my own presentation.

283
01:03:16,766 --> 01:03:17,626
So I apologize.

284
01:03:18,286 --> 01:03:25,088
So, you know, Andrews is, of course, as we all know, is a great school named after Madeline Duggar Andrews, our first woman of color elected in Medford.

285
01:03:25,108 --> 01:03:26,408
So we're very proud of that fact.

286
01:03:26,949 --> 01:03:28,489
We say it quite often at the Andrews.

287
01:03:29,196 --> 01:03:38,566
And our motto at the Andrews if you want to go through is excellence through responsibility and respect and part of that, of course, is treating everyone with kindness being responsible for your actions.

288
01:03:39,212 --> 01:03:42,254
making sure that you do the best that you can each and every day.

289
01:03:42,274 --> 01:03:43,655
We say this quite a bit.

290
01:03:44,296 --> 01:03:50,901
And my next slide that kind of goes along with that, we actually take time every year to go over manners.

291
01:03:51,541 --> 01:03:54,803
As my mother used to say, gimme's don't get anything that you don't want.

292
01:03:55,084 --> 01:04:04,711
So we tell our kids, make sure you say please and thank yous, be kind to all the adults in the building, especially our support staff, our CAF staff.

293
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:12,195
We feel that manners is something that will go forward with them for the rest of their life if they choose to listen to us when we do these presentations.

294
01:04:12,876 --> 01:04:15,978
But we feel it's an important part of developing young children.

295
01:04:16,818 --> 01:04:26,004
On the next slide, in class, we ask students, again, to do the best that they can, to be respectful of their classmates, be on time, be prepared.

296
01:04:26,576 --> 01:04:27,996
All these are really life lessons.

297
01:04:28,097 --> 01:04:30,417
Again, this is part of what we do in middle school.

298
01:04:30,917 --> 01:04:39,520
Yes, we teach academics and yes, we have lots of fun activities and events and clubs, but at the end of the day, our job is to also help them grow as individuals.

299
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:41,881
And we take this very seriously at the Andrews.

300
01:04:42,761 --> 01:04:46,422
I just hope whoever is after me will see it that way as well.

301
01:04:46,762 --> 01:04:48,683
I can't make any promises, but I'm sure they will.

302
01:04:49,883 --> 01:04:50,904
And then on the next slide,

303
01:04:51,904 --> 01:04:57,547
Some of our basics, we're doing this presentation, part of this presentation will be at our open house, which is on May 4th.

304
01:04:58,107 --> 01:05:01,288
So we're looking forward to meeting our sixth graders, our incoming sixth graders.

305
01:05:02,089 --> 01:05:04,470
And we think communication is a huge piece.

306
01:05:04,790 --> 01:05:10,572
I know here at the school community, communication to the community is a big part of what you're trying to achieve.

307
01:05:10,752 --> 01:05:11,933
And we do that at the Andrews.

308
01:05:12,673 --> 01:05:17,255
For those of you that are parents at my school, you know that my communication is pretty succinct.

309
01:05:17,755 --> 01:05:18,976
It's not wordy.

310
01:05:19,136 --> 01:05:21,057
It's pretty much bullet form for the most part,

311
01:05:21,735 --> 01:05:26,100
People are tired at the end of the day and the last thing they want to do is read about my soliloquies on education.

312
01:05:26,261 --> 01:05:29,244
So we do that quite often, of course.

313
01:05:29,344 --> 01:05:30,285
We have our student of the month.

314
01:05:30,866 --> 01:05:32,488
We have our big breakfast at the end of the year.

315
01:05:32,508 --> 01:05:38,576
The best part about the breakfast at the end of the year is grandma and grandpa usually get to come and it's a big moment for them as well.

316
01:05:39,216 --> 01:05:41,897
And then we're gonna go on to the next one.

317
01:05:41,957 --> 01:05:43,117
We have our daily schedule.

318
01:05:44,137 --> 01:05:50,318
Our schedule for our sixth graders in particular is blocks two and eight are their exploratory time, block five is their lunch.

319
01:05:50,518 --> 01:05:56,299
And we provide them with an example of a schedule so that they don't get too nervous about what their day is going to look like.

320
01:05:57,160 --> 01:06:02,181
And of course, we want them to restart on time and be there in their homeroom area by 7.50.

321
01:06:02,241 --> 01:06:04,041
Next slide, please, Dr. V.

322
01:06:05,717 --> 01:06:06,958
Dr. Cushing, whoever's doing it.

323
01:06:07,738 --> 01:06:19,865
We have lots and lots of clubs and activities and the great part about the Andrews and McGlynn is we share our clubs and activities, which is great for students who in particular in the sixth grade who are now separated from the classmates for the first time in their life.

324
01:06:20,525 --> 01:06:26,489
And now they have an opportunity to hang out with them after school in a productive way to learn many different things.

325
01:06:27,129 --> 01:06:35,258
The one club I'm going to shout out because it took me four years to get the money for I did a grant and we have a robots club now with real robots on.

326
01:06:35,579 --> 01:06:40,244
But unfortunately my, my advisor is an eighth grader miles Hilliard if your parents are watching.

327
01:06:41,946 --> 01:06:43,667
He is moving on to the high school next year.

328
01:06:44,087 --> 01:06:48,090
And without him, I don't know who's going to be able to put the robots together.

329
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:52,113
But hopefully, somebody's learned this year, some sixth grader.

330
01:06:52,373 --> 01:06:55,075
I know I have one named Cal who's doing quite well with it.

331
01:06:55,135 --> 01:06:57,536
So hopefully, they'll continue that little thing.

332
01:06:57,616 --> 01:06:58,977
And of course, we're part of the MGL.

333
01:06:59,978 --> 01:07:01,799
I'm sorry, the Boston Sport League.

334
01:07:01,819 --> 01:07:03,960
We're very fortunate to be part of that as well.

335
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:06,262
Next slide, please, Dr. Cushing.

336
01:07:06,862 --> 01:07:07,222
Please, yep.

337
01:07:08,863 --> 01:07:11,606
And then this is some activities that we put in here.

338
01:07:11,746 --> 01:07:19,474
Again, we have lots and lots of activities, everything from sports to crafts and things that one of the big things, of course, is CCSR.

339
01:07:19,594 --> 01:07:22,217
I know Mr. Tucci has his CCSR as well.

340
01:07:23,138 --> 01:07:27,803
They do a lot of great things for our school, including fundraising, et cetera.

341
01:07:27,843 --> 01:07:28,964
So the next one, please.

342
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,181
And just a little Mustang pride.

343
01:07:34,362 --> 01:07:35,843
We want kids to be happy at our school.

344
01:07:35,963 --> 01:07:40,005
For the most part, they are, I would say, most days, except after MCAS.

345
01:07:42,146 --> 01:07:44,788
Community service is a huge part of our school.

346
01:07:45,288 --> 01:07:52,152
For those of you who have been parents in my school, you know that I've done several food drives in the last few years, especially since the pandemic.

347
01:07:52,752 --> 01:07:55,034
and clothing drives and school supply drives.

348
01:07:55,875 --> 01:07:58,237
I hope whoever takes over after me continues that.

349
01:07:59,278 --> 01:08:07,466
This year alone, I raised over $2,500 in gift cards from members of my school community to give to families in need, especially during the holiday season.

350
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:11,970
And that is something that's probably the thing I'm most proud of, just giving to those in our

351
01:08:12,951 --> 01:08:14,733
city part of Mustang Nation.

352
01:08:15,393 --> 01:08:23,260
I hope that's something that people will remember long after I'm gone that when times when they needed them, I was able to help them in a small way.

353
01:08:24,001 --> 01:08:27,764
And again, you know, we try to help our fellow Mustangs out as much as we can.

354
01:08:28,344 --> 01:08:35,190
We are currently also did a cereal box drive with Melanie North and CCSR and hundreds of boxes of cereal.

355
01:08:35,310 --> 01:08:40,855
I know it sounds minor, but you know, kids need breakfast and she was able to provide that for hundreds of families.

356
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:44,271
And there's a couple of pictures in here at the end.

357
01:08:44,571 --> 01:08:46,391
I'm gonna try to catch up our tree of warmth.

358
01:08:47,292 --> 01:08:48,712
Again, it's a big hit every year.

359
01:08:48,872 --> 01:08:51,953
I'm gonna give a shout out to miss Kathy O'Donoghue, 7B.

360
01:08:52,333 --> 01:08:53,134
This is her baby.

361
01:08:53,954 --> 01:08:57,155
And the tree of warmth, as you can see, is hats, gloves, and mittens.

362
01:08:57,535 --> 01:09:01,376
Any student at any time may grab a pair or a hat if they need it.

363
01:09:01,976 --> 01:09:04,997
And we have found that most kids take it if they really do need it.

364
01:09:05,157 --> 01:09:09,979
And then whatever is left at the end of the holiday season, we donate to local charities.

365
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:11,880
It's a big part of who we are.

366
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:14,602
Again, we have newsletters to go out by teams.

367
01:09:14,982 --> 01:09:18,024
I put some hyperlinks in there for some of our team newsletters.

368
01:09:18,924 --> 01:09:20,225
We do those every month.

369
01:09:20,385 --> 01:09:21,866
Each team does a different one.

370
01:09:23,007 --> 01:09:23,927
And I believe that's it.

371
01:09:24,548 --> 01:09:28,770
So I didn't want to be too long and too short at the same time, but you know, succinct.

372
01:09:29,031 --> 01:09:29,251
Yeah.

373
01:09:29,671 --> 01:09:30,011
Thank you.

374
01:09:30,492 --> 01:09:30,812
Thank you.

375
01:09:31,792 --> 01:09:32,233
You're welcome.

376
01:09:32,253 --> 01:09:32,733
Tree of warmth.

377
01:09:32,753 --> 01:09:33,313
That's wonderful.

378
01:09:33,473 --> 01:09:34,454
Member McLaughlin.

379
01:09:37,579 --> 01:09:41,000
Sorry, I just wanted to say thank you, Mr. Downs, for your service to Medford.

380
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:43,541
And Haverhill's gain is Medford's loss.

381
01:09:43,581 --> 01:09:44,641
We wish you all the best.

382
01:09:44,661 --> 01:09:51,644
We know you're going to do well, and I'm glad you're getting back to the Valley and will be part of the Merrimack Valley that so needs you.

383
01:09:51,724 --> 01:09:52,865
So thank you.

384
01:09:52,885 --> 01:09:54,585
I appreciate that.

385
01:09:54,625 --> 01:09:55,045
I really do.

386
01:09:55,106 --> 01:09:55,706
Thank you so much.

387
01:09:57,727 --> 01:09:58,347
Thank you, everyone.

388
01:09:58,387 --> 01:09:59,387
Thank you for the presentation.

389
01:09:59,427 --> 01:10:00,067
Have a nice evening, everyone.

390
01:10:00,087 --> 01:10:00,708
Thank you so much.

391
01:10:00,768 --> 01:10:01,028
Take care.

392
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:07,362
Number three, we have recommendation to approve overnight travel to Marlborough for SkillsUSA students.

393
01:10:07,602 --> 01:10:10,263
Mr. Chad Fallon, principal, will be presenting.

394
01:10:12,604 --> 01:10:16,325
Yes, I thought Principal Fallon was gonna be on Zoom.

395
01:10:16,645 --> 01:10:17,425
I think they were.

396
01:10:17,445 --> 01:10:21,447
We can take maybe a motion to table or does anybody else?

397
01:10:21,747 --> 01:10:27,749
I can present his request for SkillsUSA.

398
01:10:33,752 --> 01:10:34,933
Let's find my report.

399
01:10:34,953 --> 01:10:35,133
Okay.

400
01:10:52,170 --> 01:10:55,471
Member Graham, would you kindly read it because I'm not seeing it right now.

401
01:10:55,671 --> 01:10:56,132
Absolutely.

402
01:10:56,472 --> 01:10:56,852
Thank you.

403
01:10:57,492 --> 01:11:00,953
I'll do my best Principal Fallon voice and try to move quickly.

404
01:11:02,214 --> 01:11:08,176
Each year Medford Vocational Technical High School joins other vocational schools from across the state to compete in their respective career technical area.

405
01:11:08,716 --> 01:11:09,877
As you may recall, we place

406
01:11:10,846 --> 01:11:13,147
every year winning bronze, silver, and gold in most categories.

407
01:11:13,307 --> 01:11:15,888
Please see the details below regarding the itinerary of events.

408
01:11:16,568 --> 01:11:19,989
There will be two students from cosmetology and two students from graphic design.

409
01:11:20,049 --> 01:11:23,410
I'm seeking approval of this annual trip for students and advisors.

410
01:11:23,891 --> 01:11:28,452
The cost has been paid from our SkillsUSA competition line in our regular operating budget.

411
01:11:29,212 --> 01:11:31,493
The field trip starts on Thursday, April 27th at 11am.

412
01:11:34,531 --> 01:11:38,112
and concludes on Saturday with an award ceremony at 9.30 a.m.

413
01:11:39,393 --> 01:11:45,415
at the Best Western Trade Center, and they will return back to Medford at around 3 p.m.

414
01:11:45,555 --> 01:11:47,315
on Saturday, the 29th.

415
01:11:47,355 --> 01:11:49,516
Motion to approve.

416
01:11:50,036 --> 01:11:50,396
Second.

417
01:11:51,957 --> 01:11:54,278
Motion for approval by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Graham.

418
01:11:54,718 --> 01:11:55,478
All those in favor?

419
01:11:55,498 --> 01:11:56,078
Aye.

420
01:11:56,238 --> 01:11:56,879
All those opposed?

421
01:11:56,919 --> 01:11:57,659
Motion passes.

422
01:11:58,619 --> 01:12:00,660
Recommendation to, what'd you say?

423
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:01,660
I said thank you.

424
01:12:02,541 --> 01:12:03,221
Thank you, Member Graham.

425
01:12:04,778 --> 01:12:13,943
Recommendation to approve travel to Spain, Dr. Vilma Bo, coordinator of world language and Dr. Peter Cushing.

426
01:12:14,483 --> 01:12:14,783
Welcome.

427
01:12:15,704 --> 01:12:15,964
Thank you.

428
01:12:17,468 --> 01:12:19,290
Thank you very much, Madam Mayor, member of the school committee.

429
01:12:20,050 --> 01:12:22,052
So this is a unique opportunity.

430
01:12:22,633 --> 01:12:42,869
This is actually an immersion trip where students will spend about 50% of the time living with a host family in Spain, while then also moving on at the latter half of the trip to more of the tours that you're familiar with, which are, you know, while not necessarily a language immersion trip,

431
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:46,170
similar to the one that's going to France next week.

432
01:12:46,271 --> 01:12:52,672
This is a specific language immersion trip for students taking Spanish while it will be opened up to other students.

433
01:12:54,312 --> 01:13:02,374
It is specifically designed for students to reside with Spanish families and to really get that authentic learning experience.

434
01:13:03,354 --> 01:13:04,895
Sorry I'm talking with my hands but

435
01:13:06,331 --> 01:13:08,193
We really hope that you'll approve this.

436
01:13:08,393 --> 01:13:11,656
We will make sure that all the requisite insurance are there.

437
01:13:11,676 --> 01:13:15,579
This is not the same company that we usually use for our trips.

438
01:13:15,740 --> 01:13:18,202
It is a different company, but Ms.

439
01:13:18,222 --> 01:13:25,328
Bebeau and the other teachers involved in planning this trip have really done their due diligence and it's tremendous opportunity for our students.

440
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:27,150
Yeah.

441
01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:30,733
Yes, Member McLaughlin, then Member Rousseau is your light on.

442
01:13:32,314 --> 01:13:32,895
Member McLaughlin.

443
01:13:33,927 --> 01:13:34,608
Yeah, thank you.

444
01:13:34,768 --> 01:13:43,252
I just had a question on I'm assuming you when you said the requisite insurance materials would have you that there will be an option for cancellation or something.

445
01:13:43,392 --> 01:13:54,118
I know that, you know, when we had the COVID experience with field trip and trying to get money back and all that don't want to obviously, you know, don't expect another global pandemic but

446
01:13:56,325 --> 01:13:58,226
you know, is there an option for cancellation?

447
01:13:58,827 --> 01:14:13,078
There will be just, everyone should know that those insurances are not as easy to access for cancellation, but it will be an option pending, you know, global unrest, various things along those lines.

448
01:14:13,098 --> 01:14:13,338
Thank you.

449
01:14:15,279 --> 01:14:15,820
Member Russo.

450
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:16,780
Thank you.

451
01:14:17,841 --> 01:14:18,262
Can I go?

452
01:14:18,342 --> 01:14:19,603
Just kidding.

453
01:14:20,023 --> 01:14:21,284
We will be looking for chaperones.

454
01:14:21,384 --> 01:14:23,906
Yeah.

455
01:14:24,366 --> 01:14:24,666
Anyways.

456
01:14:25,632 --> 01:14:33,935
I was just going to ask that we make sure that the usual travel approval forms come back to us prior to it actually happening.

457
01:14:34,295 --> 01:14:39,998
I know this is really kind of early, but we do really want to make sure that that is always filled out.

458
01:14:40,038 --> 01:14:40,718
So thank you.

459
01:14:41,118 --> 01:14:43,239
I'm actually working on revamping those forms right now.

460
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:53,063
And as a prelude, our language tours, we will also be looking for an Italian tour next year that we'll bring up in the May, at some point in May.

461
01:14:56,687 --> 01:14:57,167
Member Graham.

462
01:14:57,408 --> 01:14:58,509
Can I just ask one more question?

463
01:14:59,169 --> 01:15:13,422
Given that students will be staying with families in Spain, is there additional vetting that we've done with the tour operator about the families that our students will stay with?

464
01:15:13,563 --> 01:15:18,127
And does that create any sort of additional liability

465
01:15:19,284 --> 01:15:22,305
for us to consider as we think about approving this trip.

466
01:15:22,425 --> 01:15:27,446
I'll have to look into the liability waivers, but there's no additional vetting that the Medford Public Schools will do.

467
01:15:27,946 --> 01:15:37,068
The organization does the vetting and we, I mean, there's no international quarry or fingerprint check that we would be able to run.

468
01:15:37,708 --> 01:15:45,589
So we go on the basis of the organization who has done these trips successfully for a long time, being able to provide that.

469
01:15:45,649 --> 01:15:48,190
But I do understand your concern clearly.

470
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:59,572
And so it sounds like you are comfortable with the amount of vetting that happens between the organization that we are signing on with and the families that agree to host our students.

471
01:15:59,832 --> 01:16:00,152
Correct.

472
01:16:00,432 --> 01:16:13,454
And while they're with the families, they're still in contact and with our teachers, chaperones, and other personnel throughout that period of approximately five days.

473
01:16:14,234 --> 01:16:14,615
Thank you.

474
01:16:14,795 --> 01:16:15,495
Motion to approve.

475
01:16:15,515 --> 01:16:15,775
Sorry.

476
01:16:16,295 --> 01:16:16,575
That's OK.

477
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:17,155
Motion to approve.

478
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:37,732
for approval by member graham seconded by member mclaughlin all those in favor aye all those opposed motion passes and our fifth presentation is on the process and timeline of tiered focused monitoring and out of district enrollment update miss joan bowen director of student services good evening we saved the best for last i think i'm just kidding

479
01:16:39,691 --> 01:16:46,076
So I just, tonight I'm going to walk you through the TAD focused monitoring process that Medford is undergoing this year.

480
01:16:46,516 --> 01:16:48,618
We're in our self-assessment phase.

481
01:16:49,619 --> 01:16:56,083
This is formerly known as CPI, the Coordinated Program Review, but they've changed the title on it.

482
01:16:56,944 --> 01:16:57,745
Next slide, please.

483
01:16:57,765 --> 01:17:00,887
It's okay.

484
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:18,574
So basically tiered focused monitoring is the review of select policies, procedures, student records, and building facilities to see if schools and districts are in compliance with or following the state and federal laws and regulations for special education and civil rights.

485
01:17:19,474 --> 01:17:27,001
The PSM reviews all school districts, charter schools, vocational schools, and virtual schools across the state every three years.

486
01:17:28,208 --> 01:17:30,690
So this year we're in our district self assessment.

487
01:17:31,410 --> 01:17:36,934
Next year, the activities will include a parent survey and onsite visit with it.

488
01:17:37,775 --> 01:17:44,720
Ted focus morning will actually do a record review a document review, they'll interview staff families.

489
01:17:45,692 --> 01:17:47,933
And they'll do a facility observation.

490
01:17:48,013 --> 01:17:54,016
So this, they want to make sure that all our special education program aren't located in one part of the building.

491
01:17:54,356 --> 01:17:57,938
They want to make sure that our students have equal access to all the opportunities.

492
01:17:58,938 --> 01:18:06,322
Once that is done, they'll take a look at all of the information that we've provided and do an analysis of it and come up with a report.

493
01:18:06,823 --> 01:18:13,786
And if at any time they find that the district is not in compliance, they'll ask us to complete a corrective action plan.

494
01:18:14,266 --> 01:18:30,633
So if we were found in non-compliance for meeting timelines, I'd have to do a training with all staff members, teachers, evaluators, administrators, to make sure that they understand that this is the process and this is what needs to be followed.

495
01:18:31,073 --> 01:18:35,875
And then we submit that, they accept it, and then we have to have a monitoring process going forward.

496
01:18:36,627 --> 01:18:41,158
So the next onsite visit for Medford is during the 23-24 school year.

497
01:18:41,178 --> 01:18:45,367
And this just breaks down what the different

498
01:18:47,366 --> 01:18:54,769
but the process and the identified elements that they are going to be specifically looking at for Medford.

499
01:18:55,189 --> 01:19:06,874
So Medford's in group A, and it's called universal standards, and they address student identification, IEP development, programming and support services, and equal opportunity.

500
01:19:07,934 --> 01:19:21,997
In addition to those, the department has reserved a specific set of criteria collectively known as targeted standards employed when the LEA or school level risk assessment data includes that there is a potential issue.

501
01:19:22,737 --> 01:19:28,039
Identified targeted standards are assessed in addition to the universal standards.

502
01:19:29,399 --> 01:19:30,159
Next slide, please.

503
01:19:30,816 --> 01:19:35,200
So the self-assessment, this is what we're deep in right now.

504
01:19:36,061 --> 01:19:43,167
We have go through all, we're given the documents that we need to upload to the web-based management system.

505
01:19:44,428 --> 01:19:51,114
There's documentation for monitoring all the elements, as well as input of sample student and when appropriate staff records.

506
01:19:51,675 --> 01:19:57,220
Upon completion of all the required portions of the self-assessment, it's submitted to the department for review.

507
01:19:59,039 --> 01:20:05,462
For Medford, these are the specific indicators and special education and civil rights criterion that were selected.

508
01:20:05,923 --> 01:20:09,264
There are three indicators, which I will describe in the next slide.

509
01:20:09,724 --> 01:20:14,487
There's 11 special ed criteria, as well as three civil rights criteria.

510
01:20:16,328 --> 01:20:32,772
So the indicators there are three that we need to submit the data collection is during an identified period of time that they have given to us so the first one is indicator 11 and that measures timelines for determining initial special special education eligibility.

511
01:20:33,171 --> 01:20:41,020
From the moment the parent requests an evaluation to the 45 days when it's completed, we have to make sure that we've met all the requirements.

512
01:20:41,341 --> 01:20:52,794
So we have to upload all the students' names, the process we followed, the dates, so they will come with their on-site visit and take a look at our binders to make sure that we actually follow the process.

513
01:20:53,995 --> 01:21:00,700
Indicator 12 measures transition from early intervention to special education under IDEA.

514
01:21:01,180 --> 01:21:14,629
So this looks at evaluating students at the age of three or prior to three, finding them eligible if they require special education services and making sure that plan is put into place before their third birthday.

515
01:21:15,526 --> 01:21:41,030
And then indicator 13 is our percent of youth with IEPs age 14 and above with an IEP that includes measurable post-secondary goals that are annually updated based on age appropriate transition assessment, transition services, courses of study that will all reasonably enable the student to meet those post-secondary goals and annual IEP goals related to their transition service needs.

516
01:21:41,710 --> 01:21:43,931
So indicator 11, we were giving the,

517
01:21:45,646 --> 01:21:49,509
The timeline of October 1st to December 31st of 2022.

518
01:21:50,390 --> 01:21:53,753
Indicator 12 is January 1st to March 31st.

519
01:21:54,413 --> 01:21:58,197
And indicator 13 is October 1st to March 31st as well.

520
01:22:00,238 --> 01:22:05,283
Next slide is our special education criteria.

521
01:22:05,303 --> 01:22:13,670
And if you want more information, I can provide you the detail of what each specific criteria entails.

522
01:22:14,411 --> 01:22:17,413
For example, SE26 parent participation.

523
01:22:17,793 --> 01:22:28,680
We want to make sure that the parents are involved in when the meeting is scheduled, that they're included on the meeting invitation, and that they have an active part in the IEP process.

524
01:22:30,801 --> 01:22:33,182
Next slide is the civil rights criterion.

525
01:22:33,402 --> 01:22:35,964
And these three were selected for Medford.

526
01:22:36,444 --> 01:22:41,447
The first one is the availability of information of academic counseling and general curriculum.

527
01:22:41,487 --> 01:22:42,468
So this means that

528
01:22:43,590 --> 01:22:51,378
Students have access all students have access to counseling whether it's guidance counseling whether it's school based school adjustment counselor.

529
01:22:52,620 --> 01:22:59,167
We look at our materials to make sure that they are bias free, and then the responsibilities of the school principal.

530
01:22:59,367 --> 01:23:02,891
So for example, yeah, I'm sorry.

531
01:23:05,404 --> 01:23:08,087
I just didn't want you to get off of this slide before I ask this question.

532
01:23:08,107 --> 01:23:08,287
Sure.

533
01:23:08,307 --> 01:23:11,550
Because there's no numbers, and I can't tell you where to go.

534
01:23:11,670 --> 01:23:14,493
But do you know how the state selects these?

535
01:23:14,553 --> 01:23:15,694
Is there some randomness?

536
01:23:15,714 --> 01:23:18,938
Do they have whoever's in charge is in a particular mood?

537
01:23:19,738 --> 01:23:24,863
So I don't know the specific, but I know everyone in Cohort A in Massachusetts is going through this.

538
01:23:25,244 --> 01:23:27,927
They have the same criteria selected for them.

539
01:23:28,147 --> 01:23:28,307
Yeah.

540
01:23:28,422 --> 01:23:28,722
Thank you.

541
01:23:28,822 --> 01:23:29,542
So I don't know.

542
01:23:29,562 --> 01:23:32,564
I think every year they rotate through all of them.

543
01:23:32,584 --> 01:23:36,645
There's probably 50 something criteria for special education.

544
01:23:36,665 --> 01:23:38,246
There's about 30 for civil rights.

545
01:23:38,686 --> 01:23:41,627
So I think it may be based on PRS complaints.

546
01:23:41,787 --> 01:23:45,188
It may be based on things that they're hearing.

547
01:23:45,208 --> 01:23:50,810
So they wanna take a deeper dive into it, but every three years and every six years, it's totally different criteria.

548
01:23:51,070 --> 01:23:53,772
But it's never just like, this isn't the Medford set of criteria.

549
01:23:53,812 --> 01:23:56,312
No, this is all of cohort A, correct.

550
01:23:56,513 --> 01:23:57,113
Point of information.

551
01:23:58,564 --> 01:23:58,824
Sorry.

552
01:23:58,844 --> 01:24:02,805
Information member McLaughlin, but the indicators are 15 indicators.

553
01:24:03,185 --> 01:24:04,486
No, there's yes, there is 15.

554
01:24:04,986 --> 01:24:06,226
So there's 15 indicators.

555
01:24:06,326 --> 01:24:13,508
So if the school committee is interested and wants to know what the 15 indicators are, I can, I can provide you could send us the 15 indicators.

556
01:24:13,608 --> 01:24:21,390
And so they randomize, I would assume they ran my, or maybe based on PRS, but I would assume they randomize the indicators anyway that they pick.

557
01:24:21,450 --> 01:24:24,351
And then, you know, one cohort gets some in the other gets the other.

558
01:24:24,875 --> 01:24:31,721
But the indicators are important to know because it's really sort of how we're being judged on special education across the state.

559
01:24:31,821 --> 01:24:35,684
So I encourage the school committee, if we can get a copy of them, that would be great.

560
01:24:35,704 --> 01:24:36,044
Thank you.

561
01:24:36,204 --> 01:24:39,667
I actually went through a training at the beginning of the year and they broke everything down.

562
01:24:39,707 --> 01:24:43,450
So I can forward that to you and share it with you just so you have a better understanding.

563
01:24:43,470 --> 01:24:44,071
Yeah, it's good to know.

564
01:24:44,091 --> 01:24:50,396
I was the co-chair of the Special Ed Advisory Council and even the Special Ed Advisory Council at the state level didn't have the 15 indicators.

565
01:24:50,416 --> 01:24:51,016
So it was crazy.

566
01:24:51,537 --> 01:24:52,338
So it's good to know them.

567
01:24:52,358 --> 01:24:52,638
Thank you.

568
01:24:54,287 --> 01:25:00,472
And the next slide is, so this was, this is our activities and timeline.

569
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:03,254
So we've already, I attended the training.

570
01:25:03,514 --> 01:25:07,537
I also had several other special education coordinators attend as well.

571
01:25:08,298 --> 01:25:11,860
I want them to have more responsibility for their particular area.

572
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:18,465
So Julie Santos was with me and Kim Clinton was the high school and middle school.

573
01:25:19,526 --> 01:25:23,251
Then we, I met with staff to review the process of timeline.

574
01:25:23,792 --> 01:25:29,840
I came up with the whole schedule of when I want the documents collected I reached out to principals.

575
01:25:30,644 --> 01:25:35,286
curriculum directors, everyone that's involved in getting the documents to me.

576
01:25:36,247 --> 01:25:37,567
And that was in January.

577
01:25:37,907 --> 01:25:41,629
They have been providing me with the documents last month and this month.

578
01:25:41,729 --> 01:25:43,850
My deadline for everyone is April 30th.

579
01:25:44,350 --> 01:25:50,733
Although I do have much of it together so I can start uploading it to the portal during vacation week.

580
01:25:51,593 --> 01:25:55,615
And then the last slide is just what happens next.

581
01:25:55,695 --> 01:25:57,096
So once it's uploaded to,

582
01:25:57,984 --> 01:26:19,590
the security portal, that's our self-assessment, then PRS or TF Focus Monitoring will do a desk review, they'll look at all the documents, they'll ask for, they may say we met this criteria, we have enough documentation, or they may call me or email me and ask me for additional documents to support

583
01:26:20,350 --> 01:26:21,010
our statement.

584
01:26:21,690 --> 01:26:25,831
And then they will come out next school year, 2023, 24.

585
01:26:26,471 --> 01:26:39,794
And after that, like I said, they give us a report, we get to respond to it, and then we get a program approval saying that we've met everything that we need to do, and then we can go ahead until three years from now, and we start this process all over again.

586
01:26:40,954 --> 01:26:48,236
And I did provide you with the link that will give you much of the information in regards to TA focus monitoring.

587
01:26:49,963 --> 01:26:50,603
Anyone have any?

588
01:26:50,663 --> 01:26:51,403
Member McLaughlin.

589
01:26:53,284 --> 01:27:02,045
Yeah, so I also, so I know you present to the committee when the CPR, Tiered Focus Monitoring, just when you get to know the names, they change them.

590
01:27:02,125 --> 01:27:02,345
Right.

591
01:27:04,526 --> 01:27:13,627
And I'm assuming, or actually, can you share what the Special Education Parent Advisory Council involvement is with the Tiered Focus Monitoring?

592
01:27:13,708 --> 01:27:15,608
So they'll probably be selected,

593
01:27:20,540 --> 01:27:23,723
We had several CPAC members that were part of the interview process.

594
01:27:23,763 --> 01:27:28,167
So they interviewed, I think, each one for about 30 minutes long, questions, that sort of thing.

595
01:27:28,748 --> 01:27:30,169
They may reach out to school committee.

596
01:27:30,189 --> 01:27:35,374
I'm not sure how, but we'll get a list of participants that they would like to interview.

597
01:27:35,394 --> 01:27:36,975
Yep.

598
01:27:38,117 --> 01:27:38,337
Mayor?

599
01:27:39,238 --> 01:27:39,798
Member Russo?

600
01:27:40,919 --> 01:27:42,060
Could you send us this slide deck?

601
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:42,961
I don't think we have it.

602
01:27:43,101 --> 01:27:43,361
Sure.

603
01:27:43,742 --> 01:27:43,882
Yep.

604
01:27:43,902 --> 01:27:44,182
Thank you.

605
01:27:44,302 --> 01:27:45,003
I could do that for you.

606
01:27:46,448 --> 01:27:50,209
And then the last part is the out-of-district enrollment.

607
01:27:50,269 --> 01:27:51,710
I just wanted to provide an update.

608
01:27:52,630 --> 01:28:02,554
So I did provide school committee in your packet, just an update of the process of how students are placed in out-of-district programming and why they require it.

609
01:28:03,034 --> 01:28:04,274
But I did want to show you.

610
01:28:08,576 --> 01:28:09,576
Point of information there.

611
01:28:10,016 --> 01:28:10,416
Question.

612
01:28:10,636 --> 01:28:12,057
Sorry, I'm saying your point of information.

613
01:28:12,317 --> 01:28:12,477
Yeah.

614
01:28:13,297 --> 01:28:16,320
In our packet is a list of how they're.

615
01:28:16,721 --> 01:28:21,366
Oh yeah, this is the narrative right before this is a narrative I gave you and I just have two slides here.

616
01:28:21,666 --> 01:28:24,029
Sorry, I didn't know if there was something in addition that you're referencing.

617
01:28:24,069 --> 01:28:24,389
Thank you.

618
01:28:26,912 --> 01:28:28,574
Peter, can you put up the next slide please.

619
01:28:29,295 --> 01:28:30,256
So just currently.

620
01:28:31,755 --> 01:28:47,732
met for public schools has 40 students enrolled in out of district programming in September, we did start out at 35 we did have several students on waiting list due to coven staffing issues, so we were able to finally place several students in out of district programming.

621
01:28:50,177 --> 01:28:55,618
And I just provided you a list of the current placements that our students attend.

622
01:28:56,319 --> 01:29:09,502
There are only 26 listed, but we do have students, we do have multiple students at some of the programs and those have a star on them that there may be two or three students that currently attend those programs.

623
01:29:16,383 --> 01:29:18,424
My apologies, I was reading the slide.

624
01:29:19,683 --> 01:29:20,343
Member McLaughlin.

625
01:29:20,924 --> 01:29:21,404
Thank you.

626
01:29:21,985 --> 01:29:22,725
Thank you for this Ms.

627
01:29:22,765 --> 01:29:23,046
Bowen.

628
01:29:24,247 --> 01:29:25,027
Just a few questions.

629
01:29:25,148 --> 01:29:35,336
One is for the, I know that Medford staff attend IEP meetings for out of district students.

630
01:29:35,376 --> 01:29:46,146
And I'm curious, I know that students are entitled to a general education teacher and, or as you were saying, counselor, you know, they have access to guidance counselors, whatever.

631
01:29:46,941 --> 01:29:47,742
to attend the meeting.

632
01:29:47,762 --> 01:29:50,584
Do you know if that happens with the out-of-district placements?

633
01:29:50,804 --> 01:29:53,025
So it's a little different with out-of-district placements.

634
01:29:53,206 --> 01:30:01,331
We can have a general education person there, but it's not required for out-of-district because they're not accessing any general ed curriculum.

635
01:30:02,212 --> 01:30:06,134
So we have, our responsibility is to have a school representative there.

636
01:30:06,214 --> 01:30:12,459
So the evaluation team leader who chairs the meeting is there as that representative for Medford Public Schools.

637
01:30:13,039 --> 01:30:13,239
Okay.

638
01:30:13,659 --> 01:30:15,961
So just for clarification though, when you say they're not,

639
01:30:16,465 --> 01:30:18,646
at accessing general education curriculum?

640
01:30:18,666 --> 01:30:19,507
What do you mean?

641
01:30:19,727 --> 01:30:26,711
So they are in the most restrictive setting in and out of district placement.

642
01:30:26,771 --> 01:30:30,853
So they are in all specialized small group classrooms.

643
01:30:30,973 --> 01:30:40,319
So a student in the district, if they may have a combination of a small group setting, they don't go to electives with the general ed students.

644
01:30:40,879 --> 01:30:45,702
All their services, academics, electives are with the cohort of students that they're in.

645
01:30:46,454 --> 01:30:51,757
Okay, and then can I just ask you so for these districts and for two questions.

646
01:30:51,877 --> 01:30:56,519
One is for 40 out of the, you know, roughly 4000 students, right.

647
01:30:56,539 --> 01:30:59,540
So that's 10% of students out of district, right?

648
01:30:59,820 --> 01:31:00,761
No, 1%.

649
01:31:01,441 --> 01:31:01,761
Thank you.

650
01:31:02,062 --> 01:31:03,442
I was losing my zero.

651
01:31:03,462 --> 01:31:04,703
1% is you're like, right.

652
01:31:04,863 --> 01:31:06,944
I'm like, you and I both went to class together.

653
01:31:06,964 --> 01:31:07,084
Yeah.

654
01:31:08,860 --> 01:31:15,025
So 1% of students out of district, is that comparable, would you say, to districts similar to ours in terms of the number?

655
01:31:15,125 --> 01:31:16,046
It is.

656
01:31:16,866 --> 01:31:24,452
I'm in constant communication with all directors in Massachusetts, and there are several that have way more than us.

657
01:31:24,552 --> 01:31:31,677
And you could see when the circuit breaker funding comes out, you can see districts in the area, how many students that they do.

658
01:31:31,877 --> 01:31:35,960
I think Medford does a really great job of having programs

659
01:31:36,829 --> 01:31:40,711
located within the district, like our program for students with autism.

660
01:31:41,211 --> 01:31:46,813
A lot of districts don't have that type of programming, so they need to place students in an out-of-district program.

661
01:31:47,834 --> 01:31:48,434
Okay, thank you.

662
01:31:48,494 --> 01:32:05,821
And then out-of-district families are advised and district professionals are advised that all out-of-district students are assigned a Medford public school building or a Medford public school and have access to the activities and life of that school.

663
01:32:06,443 --> 01:32:06,924
Absolutely.

664
01:32:07,365 --> 01:32:19,462
Any extracurricular activities the principal should be notified, notifying the parents, they participate students sometimes come to the unified sports program that we run.

665
01:32:20,271 --> 01:32:23,833
any extracurricular activities, they are more than welcome to join us.

666
01:32:23,974 --> 01:32:27,476
And we want to look at what sort of support that they may require too.

667
01:32:27,516 --> 01:32:41,765
So if they need the assistance of a paraprofessional or additional support person, we want to make sure that they're ready to be, you know, welcome in the program and also be successful and have, you know, enjoy it and get the best out of it.

668
01:32:41,985 --> 01:32:43,126
And do you know, thank you.

669
01:32:43,166 --> 01:32:43,926
And then last question.

670
01:32:43,946 --> 01:32:49,430
So do you know if the families who end up with their children are not in district placements, are they,

671
01:32:50,484 --> 01:32:54,386
advised of that nature that they have a school assignment.

672
01:32:54,627 --> 01:32:57,908
So that would be the evaluation team leader would explain that to them, yes.

673
01:32:57,968 --> 01:33:00,490
Right, because they have school brains, they still have all those things.

674
01:33:00,670 --> 01:33:01,991
Okay.

675
01:33:02,031 --> 01:33:06,874
And sometimes we set the student up with an email address, a Medford email address as well.

676
01:33:07,674 --> 01:33:08,275
Okay, thank you.

677
01:33:08,295 --> 01:33:08,875
You're welcome.

678
01:33:09,775 --> 01:33:11,076
Thank you very much for the presentation.

679
01:33:11,917 --> 01:33:12,297
Thank you.

680
01:33:13,558 --> 01:33:13,738
Sorry.

681
01:33:14,858 --> 01:33:15,639
Nope, it was perfect.

682
01:33:16,580 --> 01:33:21,081
Presentations of the public, we do not have any presentations of the public or continued business.

683
01:33:21,201 --> 01:33:23,542
We do have two items under new business.

684
01:33:23,902 --> 01:33:28,043
First, 2023-06 offered by member Hayes and member McLaughlin.

685
01:33:28,983 --> 01:33:37,145
Whereas the Met for Public Schools is committed to understanding the needs of our diverse population and supporting the academic, social, emotional, physical needs of our students.

686
01:33:38,125 --> 01:33:43,987
Whereas the Trevor's Project 2022 National Survey on LGBTQ plus youth mental health found

687
01:33:44,497 --> 01:34:01,363
that 45% of LGBTQ plus youth ages 13 to 24 seriously considered attempted suicide in the previous year, and 14% of LGBTQ youth and nearly 20% of transgender and non-binary youth actually attempted suicide.

688
01:34:02,543 --> 01:34:13,947
Whereas the 2019 Massachusetts Youth Risk Behavior Survey found that compared with heterosexual side gender youth, LGBTQ plus youth were twice as likely to be bullied at school

689
01:34:14,710 --> 01:34:20,052
four times more likely to attempt suicide and significantly more likely to skip school because they felt unsafe.

690
01:34:20,852 --> 01:34:31,235
Whereas the Trevor Project found that LGBTQ plus youth who found their school to be LGBTQ plus affirming reported lower rates of attempting suicide.

691
01:34:31,715 --> 01:34:42,118
And the 2019 Massachusetts Youth Risk Behavior Survey found that social support from adults is associated with lower risk among LGBTQ plus youth for adverse experiences

692
01:34:42,674 --> 01:35:09,244
such as skipping school, being bullied at school, being bullied electronically, considering suicide and attempting suicide, be it resolved that the Subcommittee on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion meet to review guidance on policies and supports for LGBTQ plus students from the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, the Massachusetts Commission on LGBTQ Youth, the Trevor Project, the NGLSEN,

693
01:35:10,236 --> 01:35:16,143
as well as policies and supports implemented in surrounding school districts to consider policies to recommend to the entire committee.

694
01:35:16,703 --> 01:35:21,128
Dates submitted March 30th, 2023 for this week's agenda.

695
01:35:21,649 --> 01:35:22,670
Pass it off to Member Hayes.

696
01:35:24,343 --> 01:35:24,743
Thank you.

697
01:35:24,763 --> 01:35:46,190
Um, yeah, I think we know that, especially recently, there have been a number of attacks on the rights and protections for LGBTQ people in general and also especially our LGBT youth to youth in schools, and especially our transgender and non binary students.

698
01:35:49,517 --> 01:36:11,124
I wanted to look at some of the policies and some of the guidelines that have been put out by some of the groups that were mentioned in this resolution and look at what we can adopt in our schools to help support and show our LGBTQ youth that we support them and that we will provide protections in the schools.

699
01:36:13,825 --> 01:36:14,465
Motion to approve.

700
01:36:14,994 --> 01:36:15,754
Thank you for putting this on.

701
01:36:15,834 --> 01:36:20,116
Member Hayes, Member McLaughlin, motion to approve by Member Graham, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

702
01:36:20,576 --> 01:36:21,436
All those in favor?

703
01:36:21,957 --> 01:36:22,057
Aye.

704
01:36:22,317 --> 01:36:23,077
All those opposed?

705
01:36:23,337 --> 01:36:24,157
Motion passes.

706
01:36:27,279 --> 01:36:44,265
Also under new business offered by Member Hayes and Member McLaughlin, 2023-07, whereas the Memphis Public School recognizes, respects, and celebrates the diversity among our students and staff, including diversity of gender identity and gender expression,

707
01:36:44,940 --> 01:36:55,482
Whereas the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education states that schools should be sure that your handbooks and other school documents are updated to reflect the amended laws.

708
01:36:56,142 --> 01:37:02,943
Note that the gender identity law explicitly states that gender identity should appear directly after sex in enumerated categories.

709
01:37:03,523 --> 01:37:09,804
Therefore be it resolved the 2023-2024 parent and student handbooks of the metropolitan public schools will be updated with the following.

710
01:37:10,505 --> 01:37:13,125
Whereas pronouns are used, gender neutral they there,

711
01:37:13,775 --> 01:37:18,136
or gender inclusive, she, he, they, her, his, their pronouns will be used.

712
01:37:18,677 --> 01:37:25,879
Alternatively, the specific group name may be used in place of the pronouns, student, teacher, staff member, parent, principal, et cetera.

713
01:37:26,919 --> 01:37:35,862
Number two, whereas enumerated categories are used, gender identity will appear directly after sex and gender expression will be added to the protected categories.

714
01:37:38,723 --> 01:37:41,524
Submitted on the 30th of March for today's meeting.

715
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:45,201
Member Hayes, Member McLaughlin, or a motion for approval?

716
01:37:47,803 --> 01:37:50,224
Motion for approval by Member McLaughlin, seconded by?

717
01:37:50,584 --> 01:37:50,884
Second.

718
01:37:51,024 --> 01:37:52,665
Member Graham, all those in favor?

719
01:37:52,845 --> 01:37:53,065
Aye.

720
01:37:53,245 --> 01:37:54,066
All those opposed?

721
01:37:54,766 --> 01:37:55,606
Motion passes.

722
01:37:57,927 --> 01:38:03,770
Our next regularly scheduled meeting is on the 8th, oh, the 1st of May.

723
01:38:04,150 --> 01:38:05,611
It's our 8th regularly scheduled meeting.

724
01:38:05,651 --> 01:38:09,473
They'll be here at the Alden Memorial Chambers, City Hall, as well as on Zoom.

725
01:38:10,605 --> 01:38:13,768
Dr. Edward Vinson let you know of all the great events coming up in the next couple weeks.

726
01:38:14,229 --> 01:38:16,952
So I'm sure we'll see each other around quite a bit.

727
01:38:17,632 --> 01:38:18,653
Is there a motion to adjourn?

728
01:38:18,673 --> 01:38:22,257
I'm seconded by Member Graham.

729
01:38:22,297 --> 01:38:23,098
All those in favor?

730
01:38:23,118 --> 01:38:23,558
Aye.

731
01:38:23,718 --> 01:38:24,479
All those opposed?

732
01:38:24,919 --> 01:38:25,460
Motion passed.
