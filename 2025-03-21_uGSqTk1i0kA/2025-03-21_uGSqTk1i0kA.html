Castagnetti, 23 Cushing Street, Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=68.785s">asking</a>  the Council to adopt Mass General Law, Chapter 59, Section 58, for Owner-Occupied Real Estate Exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=78.013s">Citizen</a>  Castagnetti.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=79.815s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor De La Ruza. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=83.738s">Andrew</a>  Castagnetti, 23 Cushion Street, Method Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=87.522s">My</a>  phone number is 396-TIPS. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=88.923s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=96.2s">and</a>  allow me to express myself under our first amendment rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=100.103s">Um,</a>  first of all, it's not apathy when there's only a few people here at the council meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=105.646s">It's</a>  more like people have given up fighting the city hall, figuring they're probably going to do what they want anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=112.531s">Um,</a>  my petition actually read Andrew P Castagnetti petitioning the city council and the mayor to adopt mass general laws, chapter 59, <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=125.371s">Chapter</a>  59. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=125.851s">Is</a>  it okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=133.057s">Test,</a>  test, test, test. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=137.68s">Thank</a>  you anyway, just look for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=140.423s">My</a>  petition actually read the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=143.005s">It's</a>  the Andrew P Castagnetti petition, not just the city council, but in the mayor to adopt mass general laws, chapter 59, section five C. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=154.508s">for</a>  the maximum 20% owner-occupied real estate tax exemption to lower the real estate tax for the middle-class homeowner. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=169.313s">Please</a>  allow me to quote my open-ended letter in the method transcript published on October 15th. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=176.736s">I</a>  sent this to Nell Escobar Coakley, the editor. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=179.577s">Please</a>  publish my great question before this Thursday's <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=183.482s">great</a>  debate on October 15th of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=189.547s">The</a>  letter stated, question for all of city of Medford political candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=197.753s">Are</a>  you for or against the home owner occupied real estate tax exemption? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=203.357s">Go</a>  to the Commonwealth Massachusetts website and refer to a mass general laws chapter 59 section five C one. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=212.122s">Massachusetts</a>  cities are already presenting this real estate tax savings to its owner-occupied homeowners. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=220.105s">This</a>  includes three bordering cities, such as Malden, Everett, and Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=226.268s">My</a>  question is, why not here in Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=229.689s">For</a>  the past 40 or more years, our real estate tax bill in Medford has increased over 2.5 percent per annum. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=237.852s">However,</a>  if this automatic <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=241.27s">20%</a>  exemption outlining mass general laws, 59 section five C is adopted. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=246.875s">The</a>  average owner occupied homeowner would receive a $200 savings per year instead of the usual $200 increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=256.624s">That's</a>  a large swing of a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=259.886s">Again,</a>  I'm asking why not here in Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=264.471s">I'm</a>  asking all city council and mayor candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=267.573s">to</a>  respond to this question before the upcoming election so that the voters have ample time to read your responses and cast their ballots for candidates who support tax relief for the citizens of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=282.325s">Please</a>  send your written response to the method transcript, letters to the editor, and so we the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=288.811s">Thank</a>  you for your attention and response. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=290.592s">APC.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=294.255s">My</a>  question was not asked at the great debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=298.159s">And</a>  as of tonight, December 8th, 2015, I have not seen any replies of communication in the method transcript as requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=307.823s">Maybe</a>  you are not aware of this, come with the Massachusetts law or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=317.387s">I</a>  took some time today and I prepared a sampling of all the city appraised valuations. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=328.201s">some</a>  of them, most of the city Councilors, homes in the mirrors, and all of these city appraised valuations are below 539,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=338.391s">Even</a>  if all of these home values increase 10% next year, they will still see their real estate tax bill go down up to $600 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=356.494s">instead</a>  of the usual $130 to $390 increase every year, after year, after year, and so on. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=367.34s">The</a>  one exception is one of the Councilors, and it may go up a whopping $7. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=375.784s">Bottom</a>  line, nine of 10 owner-occupied average homeowners will save <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=385.924s">about</a>  $200 a year instead of the usual $200 increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=390.725s">That's</a>  a big swing. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=392.606s">Again,</a>  why not here? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=397.167s">And</a>  I'm under the weather. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=399.428s">I'm</a>  not feeling so good, so I never finished the rest of my spiel. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=404.13s">But</a>  basically, I hope when you do the allocation that you will <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=414.254s">give</a>  the average owner, occupied homeowner who lives in their one house only the full 20 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=422.759s">That's</a>  all I have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=424.54s">I</a>  request for the sixth consecutive year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=427.761s">Thank</a>  you for listening.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=432.264s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Castagnetti. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=436.086s">Good</a>  evening.</p>

    <p>[L7QFU4RDE4Q_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=708.551s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=710.228s">My</a>  name is Ed O'Neill. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=711.228s">I'm</a>  the chief assessor appraiser and also the chairman of the board of assessors for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=716.43s">And</a>  I am here respectfully appearing before your honorable body tonight for the purpose of holding a public hearing to discuss the following items concerning the allocation of the fiscal year 2016 property tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=729.353s">Number</a>  one, to determine the residential factor to be used for fiscal year 2016 by selecting the minimum residential factor, a percentage of the total tax levy, <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=739.763s">will</a>  be shifted from the residential taxpayer to the commercial, industrial, and personal property taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=745.947s">This</a>  results in a lower tax rate for residential properties and a higher tax rate for commercial, industrial, and personal property taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=754.073s">Historically,</a>  the council has chosen the minimum residential factor. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=757.616s">If</a>  this is once again the council choice, the minimum residential factor is 0.897446. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=765.541s">Number</a>  two, to adopt an open space discount. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=768.367s">This</a>  does not apply in the city of Medford, but a no vote is required. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=772.411s">Number</a>  three, to adopt a residential exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=775.554s">If</a>  adopted, owner-occupied residential properties may receive an exemption of up to 20% of the average residential value. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=783.101s">This</a>  is accomplished by shifting a portion of the tax levy from the owner-occupied residential properties to non-owner-occupied properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=790.828s">Since</a>  this shift causes a higher residential tax rate, <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=794.144s">a</a>  number of owner-occupied properties would also see an increase in their tax bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=799.125s">Number</a>  four, to adopt a small commercial exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=802.486s">If</a>  adopted, commercial properties housing a business employing 10 or less people and valued at less than a million dollars may receive an exemption of up to 10% of the recessed value. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=813.248s">This</a>  is accomplished by shifting a portion of the commercial industrial tax levy from these eligible properties to other commercial and or industrial properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=822.15s">Since</a>  this shift causes a higher <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=824.195s">commercial</a>  industrial tax rate, all commercial industrial not receiving the exemption would see an increase in their tax bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=831.056s">As</a>  part of this hearing tonight, it is the duty of the board of assessors to notify the council of any excess levy capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=838.338s">Fiscal</a>  year 2016, excess levy capacity is $25,391.53. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=842.498s">Please</a>  refer to the handout from last week at the committee of the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=852.993s">And</a>  Mr. President, Councilor Lengelkorn asked for the abbreviated version of the presentation.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=937.034s">In</a>  opposition to the matter as presented in the public hearing as outlined by the assessor, Mr. O'Neill, the four-point plan to, one, determine the residential factor to be used, two, adopt an open space discount, three, adopt a residential exemption, four, adopt a small commercial exemption.</p>

    <p>[Sorrell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=958.291s">No,</a>  I'm not in opposition to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=959.672s">I</a>  do want that discussed thoroughly.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=997.094s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=998.294s">I'd</a>  just like to bring in paper 15795 in coordination with the public hearing so that we can</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1008.989s">On</a>  the motion to merge 15-795 into this discussion, it reads, offered by Vice President Lungo-Koehn, be it resolved that the proposed tax levy be reduced by $1 million, which is less than half of the amount we put into free cash from last year's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1027.818s">All</a>  those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1031.02s">To</a>  merge it?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1031.96s">To</a>  merge it in.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1033.181s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1057.9s">It</a>  will have to be voted on separately. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1059.381s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1060.021s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1060.241s">Move</a>  it as an amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1061.841s">Um,</a>  once we discuss, you know, obviously we're going to all discuss that.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1064.702s">So</a>  very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1065.363s">So</a>  the chair recognizes, uh, Councilor lungo current for discussion.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1069.644s">I'll</a>  yield to the, um, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1075.966s">Point</a>  before we get into that, uh, Mr. O'Neill point of information for the assessor before you start suddenly. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1087.257s">You</a>  were asked last week to forward us information. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1090.078s">You</a>  indicated there was 1,569 parcels of land that are over the $580,000 assessed value. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1098.7s">And</a>  we asked for a breakdown of that 580 going up in increments of $50,000 per piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1105.642s">We</a>  never got that.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1111.604s">It</a>  was distributed according to the clerk and the packages we received over the weekend on Friday afternoon.</p>

    <p>[L7QFU4RDE4Q_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1117.962s">That's</a>  not— For you, Mr. President, I gave that to the clerk Thursday late afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1126.632s">I</a>  may have some additional copies.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1129.455s">In</a>  my package, it was paper clipped. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1133.51s">paper-clipped</a>  to the piece that began with the long-awaited explanation of the parking revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1143.157s">Through</a>  the chair, yeah, it was actually paper-clipped to something irrelevant to the tax hearing, so it was a little... The clerk has pointed out that it was part of the committee report that we had requested, therefore it was connected all as one.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1161.136s">then</a>  through the chair, if I may, President Dello Russo, Mr. O'Neill, if we can, while the other Councilors are viewing that, I did take a look at it myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1172.085s">If</a>  you could just explain how it's broken down as a, it is hard to grasp all the numbers, but what we were looking for, and I think it must be in here, is the increase to, yeah, the dollar amount increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1188.097s">I</a>  don't, I don't really see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1189.863s">And</a>  if I could, just for the viewing public, I know Mr. O'Neill or myself or one councillor every year kind of explains the problem we have with the shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1200.39s">I</a>  don't know, you always seem, probably will say it better than I do, but the issue I have as a councillor to shift to non-occupied is that this year there'll be over 16,000, 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1211.016s">1569,</a>  1,569 homes <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1219.553s">that</a>  are valued at 580 or above that will also see the shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1223.616s">They</a>  will also get increases in taxes that other homes will not get. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1228.119s">So</a>  that's where the problem is always lied. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1230.06s">That's</a>  the reason the way it's worded and the way the legislature worded it becomes an issue for, you know, how can we create a shift for 15 to 16 homes when we're not creating it for everybody? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1242.488s">So</a>  that's where always I've had a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1245.01s">So</a>  at our last meeting, we did discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1247.132s">We</a>  discussed it in the committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1249.648s">Mr.</a>  O'Neill to break it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1253.149s">The</a>  average home of 580,000 or more, what type of shift would that create for these homes, which is, you know, that's a good amount of homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1262.432s">I</a>  think it was out of 12,000, there was almost 1,600 homes that are going to be affected if we ever approve the shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1269.454s">So</a>  this breakdown, if you could just kind of clarify which each category, each column represents and the actual dollar figure for the increase, depending on <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1279.263s">the</a>  value of the 580 or above. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1281.548s">That</a>  would be helpful for me.</p>

    <p>[L7QFU4RDE4Q_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1289.229s">After</a>  the committee, the committee of the whole meeting on Tuesday, uh, the council had requested, uh, more detailed analysis, uh, and increments of 25,000 or so in value, uh, you know, above the break even point of five 80, 100. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1303.761s">So</a>  I did a couple before that for started at 400,000 to 500 to five 25, five 50, five 80, um, all the way up to a million point two. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1315.822s">I</a>  did the analysis on adopting a 10% exemption, a 15%, and a 20%, which is currently allowed by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1324.286s">We'll</a>  start with the 10%, and that's in the original packet, plus the handout that was given to the council on Thursday afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1334.471s">So</a>  basically, if you look at, and I believe everybody has that now?</p>

    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1339.474s">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[L7QFU4RDE4Q_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1340.054s">Folks</a>  in the audience as well, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1344.205s">So</a>  there's small increases after 580 to 600. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1348.466s">So</a>  at a 10% adoption of the exemption, it'd be a $20 increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1354.348s">Now</a>  this is on top of the regular increase of 125, 130, 140. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1356.508s">That's</a>  an additional. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1358.949s">So</a>  you go up to 625, it's about 42 more dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1361.29s">675,</a>  it's about $88. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1362.47s">Say</a>  750 is 156. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1373.624s">then</a>  it starts to increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1375.305s">You</a>  get $800,000, there'll be an additional $202 plus the regular $150. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1382.811s">So</a>  it's a significant impact as you go up the line in the value.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1387.035s">So...</a>  Just a point of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1389.337s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1390.618s">As</a>  you're making this assumption that the values, as they go up significantly, even if you took a house that's valued at $800,000, they're going to get an increase of $202. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1400.345s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1402.781s">over</a>  and beyond whatever the tax rate's gonna be. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1405.243s">But</a>  if you go to a house that's only valued at $400,000, they're gonna get a decrease of 161.91.</p>

    <p>[L7QFU4RDE4Q_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1410.907s">Correct,</a>  that's why I put that in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1413.569s">The</a>  council only asked for anything above 580, but just for illustration purposes.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1418.814s">I</a>  wouldn't want anyone to think that the same type of value going up doesn't correspond to the devaluation going down, because there is merit that goes both ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1427.981s">It's</a>  quite obvious that under the 580, going backwards, <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1431.209s">and</a>  lower amount, the rate is even higher giving back than going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1436.452s">And</a>  if you're only talking about 1,569 votes, you know, to me, I think this is an important time to really take into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1444.255s">Maybe</a>  it's about time we start looking at this and giving rate payers in this community a break because, you know, they're just going to get saddled now with the CPA tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1453.3s">You</a>  know, whether you voted for it or not, every house is going to get stuck with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1456.661s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1457.062s">Fiscal</a>  17 for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1458.062s">Pardon</a>  me? <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1458.883s">Fiscal</a>  17. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1460.285s">But</a>  they're still going to get stuck with it for five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1463.387s">And</a>  for the next five years, they're going to be stuck with a tax that, whether you voted for it or against it, you're going to be stuck with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1470.511s">So</a>  I think if there's a way to look at a break here for the homeowners, it's giving that exemption, whether it's 10, 15, or 20%. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1476.995s">And</a>  I'm leaning toward that, because I think if you can afford a house that's $800,000, <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1484.224s">You</a>  can afford to pay maybe another couple hundred dollars more a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1489.209s">I</a>  don't know how many houses in the city are worth $800,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1492.954s">So</a>  you've got 1,569 houses broken down from 580 going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1498.42s">You've</a>  got 9,000 and something from 580 going backwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1503.005s">And</a>  it sort of tells me that the majority should rule in something like this.</p>

    <p>[L7QFU4RDE4Q_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1507.208s">That's</a>  why I put that in the illustration. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1509.109s">Again,</a>  it's in the packet every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1512.711s">The</a>  majority would get a reduction at the expense of the non-owner occupied apartment buildings and owner occupied above the 580. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1523.258s">That's</a>  why I did the illustration so you can actually see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1526.14s">So</a>  there's 1,569 properties that would still pay more. <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1531.143s">It</a>  would be incremental depending upon their assessment, correct?</p>
